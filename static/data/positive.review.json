    "\nSphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read. \n\nThe story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.\n\nThis novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.\n\nI would strongly recommend this book\n",
    "\nDr. Oz is an accomplished heart surgeon in the field of cardiac transplantation. He describes how he combines complementary medicine (e.g. hypnosis, reflexology, yoga, message, acupuncture. Etc) with orthodox Western medicine. There is an excellent forward by Dr Dean Ornish, and an interesting epilogue containing an overview of the complementary medicine techniques. The bulk of the book contains stories of patients Dr. Oz treated using this revolutionary way. I am a cardiologist, and I have a great interest in combining western medicine with complementary medicine, which is the reason I bought this book. However this book was a bit boring to read and was also a bit of a disappointment. Nevertheless, those interested in this new medicine, which I think will be the medicine of the new millennium, will want to read this book\n",
    "\nThe most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again.\nA must-have for comic book fans.\n",
    "\nThis book is for lovers of Robicheaux.  His demons seem put to rest, redemption seems almost within his grasp - and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages.  The poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade Burke\u0027s prose as always, but his anger at humanity\u0027s shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface.  Hurricane Katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing.  A bit like Robicheaux himsel\n",
    "\nThis is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length. I want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful, engaging and thought provoking story.\n\nThis book packs the punch of great fiction. It covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic. You certainly don\u0027t need to be a history major, biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author.\n\nJared Diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography, environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations. I think the major shortcoming of his work is that he doesn\u0027t give enough credit to social factors and their role is history.\n\nIf you don\u0027t know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture, the need for armies, etc. You will find this fascinating reading. If you have a deep knowledge of these areas, anthropology and sociology, you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying. However, most likely you will enjoy the well-written story if you can keep in mind that it doesn\u0027t provide the full picture.\n\nIn short, this book magnificently illuminates Jared Diamond\u0027s specific areas of interest, while downplaying or neglecting others. It provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner.\n",
    "\nSince I am a World\u0027s Fair \"fanatic\" I have read almost everything that I can on the subject. In general, this is an interesting and well researched book. The author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about. However, I must point up three rather glaring errors in the book. In describing the Louisiana World Expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be \"80 feet tall,just 150 feet shorter than the Eiffel Tower.\" Since the Eiffel Tower is actually over 900 feet tall,the New Orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall.This may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time.The other error states that the US Pavilion at the Brussels World\u0027s Fair of 1958 was a \"large,squat,round concrete block structure.\" It was indeed large and round, but not squat and not made of concrete blocks.According to the excellent book about Edward Durrell Stone, the architect of the pavilion,the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light. I have seen photos of the US Pavilion, and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me. (In comparison to the Soviet Pavilion, which resembled a large refrigerator!) Thirdly, the Spokane Expo of 1974 was not the first time that the U.S.S.R. exhibited at a U.S. expo. They had a large pavilion at the New York World\u0027s Fair of 1939. All in all, however, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of World\u0027s Fairs\n",
    "\nThis the one book that taught me more about how to use my SLR than the camera\u0027s manual itself. The step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography. I also liked the way Mr. Frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter. One take without the filter and then the same one with a filter.  Also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field.  An encompassing book, the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment.  The peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown. A good buy and money well spent. My only gripe is that I preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag\n",
    "\nTom Friedman is a engaging writer.  He also writes from a very personal perspective, both as to how the world has changed for him and his family, and for his friends around the world.  You get the feeling that Mr. Friedman is describing the world changing as he is watching.  What a treat and a very easy read.  Pick it up and learn about what is really going on outside the US shores\n",
    "\nJohn Crowley\u0027s well-deserved recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the English language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980\u0027s. His \u0026quot;Great Work of Time\u0026quot; is an intriguing Rashomon-esque time travel fantasy about Cecil Rhodes and British economic imperialism in East Africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. It was almost as compelling a read as the \u0026quot;The Nightingale Sings At Night\u0026quot;, which offers a fantastical twist on the Adam and Eve creation myth saga. The other two tales, \u0026quot;In Blue\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Novelty\u0026quot;, I found much less compelling, but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose Crowley uses in other tales. It was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library; a surprise which I think many readers will also discover\n",
    "\nThis story captivated me right from the outset, as Vivian copes with age-related loss of memory. Her scenes are tenderly drawn in sensitively described and insightful detail, and she is a very realistically portrayed. \n\nAs Susannah packs up her childhood home and prepares to move Vivian into an assisted living apartment, she uncovers clues to her past concerning the mysteries of her brother\u0027s death and whereabouts of her long-lost high-school sweetheart. With just the right blend of drama, action, suspense and resolution of family issues, this enjoyable story is very uplifting and thought-provoking, providing reflections for my own midlife crisises. It is easily read within a couple of hours, and there is a subtle tie-in to the Blossom Street books, leaving the possibility that these likable characters may reappear in subsequent books in that series. \n\n",
    "\nI found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk I visit at least once every summer.  I love going there and looking to see if I can find a book that I have never heard of, by an author I\u0027ve never heard of, and buy it on a whim.  This is the novel I bought last year.  I has, unfortunately, sat on my shelf since then until tonight, because of many reasons.  Tonight, however, I picked it up and read it cover to cover.  The narrative was brilliantly told, the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching.  If I had made it to the end without some tears, I would believe myself made of stone!  \n\nSkip is a character many can relate to: a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out, down about how his friends have really not been friends at all, that gets the chance to do something great by this little child.  However, it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the BLESSINGS of the title.  Faith, a name not used lightly, restores her namesake in all those touched by her.  She ultimately gives him the chance  of making something of his life without even knowing it.  Many BLESSINGS occur in this wonderful novel, and I found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times, but also proud at how humankind can be at others (which is a fact, in itself, that proves how well Quindlen has spun her tale).  The fact is that just because a person has been to jail, has deadbeat friends, does not mean he is of that same stock; just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her.  Skip, Lydia, Nadine, Meredith, Jennifer...all have many dimentions to their characters that Quindlen has spectacularly drawn\n",
    "\nI checked out this cookbook from the library and as soon as I cracked it open I knew I needed a copy of my own.  It is full of simple, tasty, and easy to prepare recipes.  I really like how most of the recipes don\u0027t require many special ingredients and how simple the directions are.  I was a little apprehensive having made the decision to become a vegetarian but this cookbook gave me confidence I\u0027d still be able to enjoy a flavorful variety of cuisine\n",
    "\nI sit here with my two newly acquired volumes of the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America in absolute awe!  With almost 200 contributors, almost 800 entries and nearly 400 illustrations, editor Andy Smith and Oxford University Press have done a magnificent job of putting together what is clearly the most comprehensive work on this immensely broad subject ever undertaken.  Whether you are a food professional or interested amateur, a historian, sociologist or anthropologist, a student or scholar, these volumes will no doubt become your most important resource for information related in any way to the history of food and drink in America.  The scope is astounding, spanning some five centuries and ranging from events and trends to products, from ethnic, religions and cultural influences to political and social movements in American history, and also includes dozens of biographical entries of important contributors and influences on the development of culinary life and gastronomy in America.  Despite the enormity of this work, it is refreshingly approachable, set forth alphabetically, written in clear language, translated when needed, and annotated and supplemented with bibliographical information for those wishing to explore further.  As a food professional-recipe developer, food writer and culinary educator-there is no doubt in my mind that these pages will soon be worn and this seminal work will remain among my most valued and cherished resources for as long as my interest in food and gastronomy is alive.\n\n",
    "\nI borrowed this book on CD from the library and half way through, ordered the book so I would have it to refer to. Excellent book, highly recommended. Helps to put a realistic perspective on millionaires\n",
    "\nI saw the 1963 classic first, which happens to be one of my most favourite ghost movies of all time! (what a major disappointment the remake was). So as soon as I could a got a copy of this. It was an awesome novellete. I read it in one sitting, couldn\u0027t put it down! I do have to say I enjoyed the movie better...but this is a great journey as well.\n",
    "\nWhile expertly crafted, this is not a pretty novel, nor is it gentle.  The subject matter -- abduction of a child -- is somber, as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying.  The plot twists and turns, as befits a LeHane novel, and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying. But you can usually trust Lehane to take good care of you in this, one of his finer books.  And not only are there plot twists to wrestle with, there are more than a few serious moral issues that will have you squirming or at least scratching your head.  All in all, this was a solid, enjoyable thriller.  The reader will feel his time was not wasted\n",
    "\nAwesome. This book is worth its weight in gold for the insights and understanding it shares. With a professional background in finance, economics and a profound study of the Word of God, the author is well qualified to expose mammon for what it is, and to challenge the reader to a deeper surrender to the only real treasure worth having. Buy two and give a copy away. Can we have a new edition please\n",
    "\nThis book does something I\u0027ve never seen before. It shows a cool young homo boy who\u0027s punk rock and a skater, not some wishwashy queen-boy. Sam, the lead character, is really cool. I\u0027d like to be his friend, and his boyfriend, but that\u0027s another matter. Also, the dude he likes, Clay, is really hot. He\u0027s a surfer, but he\u0027s not a stereotypical surfer, he\u0027s much cooler, and also a little punk rock. I love this novel. The ending is really sad, but I loved it\n",
    "\n\tFear nothing is about Christopher Snow, whose parents die in supposedly innocent ways, but Chris soon finds out that what is seems is not really what it is, and even that his little town of Moonlight Bay is stranger, and scarier, than he thought. Chris then sets out with his friends, and his dog, to find out the truth about what\u0027s really going on.\nFear Nothing is a good plot written in typical Koontz style. Fear nothing grabs you from the beginning and holds you all the way through. It keeps you guessing and just when you think you have it figured out, it throws something new at you and makes you guess some more. Koontz creates some very likable characters and by the end of the story, you like them, and feel as if you know them.\n\tFear Nothing is very descriptive, Koontz describes his locations so well you feel like you\u0027re in them, and experiencing the plot right next to the main character. I have not read the sequel, but I am anxious to do so.\n",
    "\nI\u0027m not even a vegetarian , let alone a vegan, and this book offers such flavorful and simple recipes.  Some more time consuming than others but definitely worth the wait!  Unless you hate veggies, this book is a must have!  I just made the Herb Scalloped potatoes as a side dish and the author was right, it\u0027s hard to believe there\u0027s no cheese or cream! the pizza with caramelized onions, kalmata olives and tomatoes is fantastic too!. . . . .lots of yummyness\n",
    "\nVery good, easy, light \u0026 funny read!  Although his best, by far, in my opinion was \"Running with Scissors\".  This was an enjoyable read \u0026 would recommend reading his work if you like David Sedaris, both have a similiar style\n",
    "\nReading this book is like having a holy vision: I feel as if I should tell the world about it, but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe I should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me, into my life, into my head.\nThe book is the story of Billy Parham, a son in a late-1930s New Mexican ranching family.  Billy traps a wolf that has been killing his father\u0027s cattle but realizes he can\u0027t kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old Mexico.  Billy crosses the border into Mexico, and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams, where everyone moves as if the air was liquid, where every ruin has an irretrievable story, where soot and heat and danger hang in the air, and where nothing ever goes as planned.\nThe story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor, \"All the Pretty Horses,\" but that\u0027s not necessarily a shortcoming.   The book sprawls out like a wide hot desert--curling north and south, east and west, across the present and into the past.  The writing is as good as any writing I\u0027ve ever read ever, and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years.  For example: the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth.\nThis is a book that needs to be read.  Pick it up, and let it seep into your skin, let it open you to other worlds and peoples and ideas, and let it change you.  Let it open your eyes to the world, and to the West, and the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us.  \nThis is a book made of all those ineffable things that most of us just can\u0027t put into words.  But here, somehow, Cormac McCarthy has managed to do just that.  Here is the intangible, but tangible.  Here is the unnameable, but named.  Here are the thoughts you could never express, expressed.\n",
    "\nBeautiful vineyards, fueding families, mystery, and an unlikely love story with a twist. Great read. Prepare to read this one through because it was hard to put down!!!\n",

    "\nPaul Sheldon,a very good writer famous for his books in the \"Misery\" series.A popular character in his book is someone named Misery.In his final book he kills the character off,therby ending the series.Paul\u0027s number one fan is Annie Wilkes,a retired nurse.(I would like to say,retarded).\n\n One day Paul gets into an accident and gets both of his legs severely damaged.Coincidently,Guess who finds him?\n Annie.Yes,she finds him and starts to nurse him back to good health.But when she soon finds out that Paul has killed the character \"Misery\",Annie is pissed...She makes it her business to get Paul to write another novel in which \"Misery\" is not killed.It sounds simple,I know.But when Paul refuses to write the novel,Annie uses force,and she tortures him so much that he just gives in and begins to write a new novel.\n  Meanwhile thinking of a way to escape,Paul writes the novel and suffers at the same time.He lost one of his foot,because she burnt it off!Yes,this Annie Wilkes is a lunatic.While Paul is under Annie\u0027s capture,he learns alot about things he took for granted.The ending of this book is a happy one,you won\u0027t be disappointed.I recommend this book as any other SK novel.It is a great Suspense,drama novel...enjoy...Nigel\n\nHere is another version of the plot.(taken from wikipedia)...\n\n\"The story begins with Paul Sheldon slowly waking out of a coma. Gradually, his memory returns to him: he is a wildly popular romance novelist of the Misery series of novels (the main character of which is named Misery Chastain) who has crashed his car in a winter storm outside of Silver Creek in Grand County, Colorado, and has been badly injured. His rescuer, Annie Wilkes, is a former registered nurse and has taken him to her secluded country home to personally care for him.\n\nAs luck would have it, Annie is Paul\u0027s \"number one fan\" and eagerly awaited all his publications. Almost immediately however, Paul realizes that there is a flip side to this coin: Annie is mentally ill, she has not told anyone where he is, and she has a violent past that includes a successful career as a serial killer.\n\nAnnie begins to physically and psychologically abuse Paul when she finishes reading his latest published work, in which the heroine Misery dies. Annie later forces him to burn an unpublished manuscript of his new novel, \"Fast Cars\" he was carrying at the time of his accident, disgusted at its radical departure from the Misery series. Eventually, Annie forces Paul to write a new Misery novel \"just for her\" and bring the character back from the dead. Paul works on the book as Annie\u0027s violent mood swings and her psychosis deepens. Her insanity escalates as Paul tries to escape; she eventually chops off one of Paul\u0027s feet, one of his thumbs, and murders a police officer investigating his disappearance. As the authorities begin to close in on Annie, Paul\u0027s plight--both in his writing and his attempt to save his life--becomes more desperate.\n\nPaul eventually defeats Annie by smashing her over the head with the second hand typewriter she had given him to write \"her\" novel. After he escapes, he publishes the new Misery novel to great critical acclaim.\"...enjoy...Nigel\n\n",
    "\nAs I read, I kept trying to figure out whether this tale is a collection of reflections on how two religions can destroy a region and its people, whether the characters have broader agendas than their stories or whether it\u0027s just a good tale peppered with strong political images.  \n\nAnd, a good story it is.  How can you beat this writing?\n\n\"The pandits of Kashmir were left to rot in their slum camps, to rot while the army and the insurgency fought over the bloodied and broken valley, to dream of return, to die while dreaming of return, to die after the dream of reture died so that they could not even die dreaming of it, why was that why as that why was that why was that why was that\" (p. 297)\n\n\"The beauty approached him, beckoning.

    "\nThe Andromeda Strain tells the story of a bacteria growth in Piedmont, Arizona. This bacteria kills people in a matter of seconds and killed everyone in the town except for a 69 year old man and a baby. A top secret commission is formed to see how these bacteria kill people and to see how they can be stopped. \n\nThis book has the makings of a real thriller. I couldn\u0027t put the book down through the first 250 pages. However, this book had a dissipointing ending.\n\nThis book involves a lot of \"cool\" technology. This book could have taken place today (instead of 1969) because I could visualize a lot of the book. I found myself thinking \"Awesome technology\" more then I was thinking that Crichton is sure a great author. He seemed to involve a little too much foreshadowing. \n\nThis book does involve a lot of research and \"up-to-date theories\" for 1969, but is a little dated today. This does not take anything out of the story.\n\nI would recommend this book because it is really interesting. Lots of research went into this book. The book is fast paced and has many modern aspects of a Crichton novel\n",
    "\nStill a great read, but not as good as Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples.  Foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol, but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom, dad and other relatives and friends.  The highs are not as high, nor the lows as low in Garlic and Sapphires.  Reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader; that said, I hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book\n",

    "\nThis was the first novel I read from Endo, and I have to confess to being hooked on it from the first. It is both interesting from a historical perspective, taking in an event that was singularly fascinating, and deeply profound from a psychological perspective. It is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day.\n\nHasekura is a deep character, and the reader spends a bit of time with Hasekura\u0027s thoughts. This is especially so as Hasekura confronts the emaciated, dying Christ that he sees on his travels toward Rome. The possibility of faith in this \"pathetic man\", and the conflict that produces with his duty to Lord and ancestors, forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with Hasekura\u0027s desires, dreams and simple wishes. The psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact.\n\nA notable part of the book is tied up with Father Velasco, whose ambition seems to know no limits. His own struggles with ambition, and the self-justifications that he employs, are a lesson worthy of remembering. \n\nThis novel is a great one, and I was hooked to the very last page. It will take you into the world of Hasekura, Velasco and their companions, as they themselves see it. It will take you into their dreams, their hopes, their fatalism, their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation. I totally, unreservedly recommend this novel. I love this novel\n",
    "\nI was given this book by a friend as a going away gift.  The day I decided to read it, I was ill and lay on the couch reading it in one sitting.  I was a bit drowsy, but I could not but it down...It made me nervous, excited, sad, and happy...all the emotions that a good book or movie can offer.  Get this if you are a serious reader looking for a fictional escape\n",
    "\nDry is anything but what the title of this work implies.The pages drip with boozy escapades and one can almost smell and taste the liquor on Augusten Burroughs breath.A must for drinkers who would like to stop or at least reassess what the heck is going on in their lives.Almost motivational in its honest appraisal of the difficulties inherent in this addiction. The writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth,funny, yet foreboding and diary-like in its presentation.Burroughs clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it, especially the limited usefulness of rehab.The story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call, \"a hard core drinker\" as he anticipates the \"next one\".Passages describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas,job and sexual conundrums.Dry is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit them.This is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle, yet has a strong finish.An earlier work \u0027Running With Scissors\u0027 was apparently good enough for Hollywood, so take a shot with DRY.After all, when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do, it might be time to slow down,stop and get a copy of Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and a copy of Dry.  CHEERS!!\n",
    "\nOMG!!! I could not put this book down... I am in my upper twenties and I am going thru a bunch of these symptoms already. Yes the book is bios about natural progesterone, so what... I have not personally used progesterone cream yet, because I am waiting for my saliva test results to make sure that\u0027s what I need. But even if I don\u0027t, everything else provided in the book is amazing information. Your diet, your vitamins, your stress level, your physical activity, everything is co-related to most woman\u0027s hormonal imbalances. They even talked about a case where a woman did not want to use the natural progesterone and how by changing all of the other stuff in her life, she achieved hormone balancing. If you are suffering from hormonal imbalances, I will strongly recommend this book. I also bought other ones that I will be reading after this one. But I started with \"Be Lean by Romy Seleznov\", which is a story from her life and how she struggled to balance her hormones and gives all the details of what she did, then I continued with this book, and the next one I will be reading is \"Natural Hormone Balance for Women\" by Uzzi Reiss, which does cite this book as well. \n\nIf you think you have a hormonal imbalance, please do not rely on your doctor 100%, I am not saying that you should not believe them or rule out everything they say, but do your homework. I have been telling my doctors since I am in my TEENS that I feel I have an imbalance with my hormones and since all of the results come back fine they have been telling me that my symptoms were \"normal\"... WRONG!!! Now they found a tumor in my pituitary gland, which causes an imbalance... The tumor grows slowly, so I am sure that it has been there for years, but they never checked it before. Now that I am treating it, all of my \"normal\" symptoms are almost gone. I am still on the process of getting everything in balance. If you feel you have something wrong, even if the results of your blood work comes as normal, READ more and look for healthy ways of changing your diet, exercising more, balance your hormones, and look for second opinions and definitely have a good naturopath that you can go to. Also \"Bikram Yoga\", is an excellent exercise to helping you with hormonal balancing. At least that\u0027s part of what I changed.\n",
    "\nWhilst the book may seem a little dated when it talks of tweed in the country and a matching silk jacket for your cocktail dress, it does contain a lot of useful information about putting together a great career wardrobe on a budget, which colours match, which accessories never date, and how to dress for evening functions of any nature.\nI highly recommend it for anyone who thinks Jackie Kennedy was the epitome of chic, and who would like to know how to pull it off themselves\n",
    "\nThe quirky illustrations done by the masterful Dave McKean at once contribute to the book\u0027s charm, but also lend to its dread. However, this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares. Some people may not appreciate Dave McKean\u0027s artwork as much as they should, because it is so different, at least to those not familiar with the Sandman graphic novel series written by Neil Gaiman in which Dave McKean did the cover art for all the books. At first glance the layout might seem confusing, even distracting, yet it somehow works here. Neil Gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing. He introduces us to a charming young girl named Lucy, who suspects something is not right with her home. And though her pig-puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear, the rest of her family do not...until it\u0027s too late. The action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end, though perhaps it is not. You be the judge. This is a worthy book to read to third-graders and above, though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern. Neil Gaiman deserves praise for bringing his brand of storytelling to a younger audience, one so unfamiliar with his other work. I highly recommend this book\n",
    "\nIf you are planning to become a landlord, buy this essential book before you purchase a rental property or hang that \"For Rent\" sign in front of your house.  A healthy dose of legal reality will counterbalance any easy money ideas you may have and help you decide whether the work and risk involved in being a landlord is how you would like to make money.  The legal concepts you learn may even influence which properties you buy and how you maintain them.\n\nIf you are already a landlord, keep this book at your finger tips.  The information is well organized and easy to find for quick reference.  Legal concepts are presented in plain language and illustrated with scenarios showing how the concepts might play out in real life.\n\nThe authors make dry legal topics as interesting as possible.  Add the urgency of knowing a legal misstep could land you on the wrong side of a lawsuit, and you will find yourself eagerly turning these pages\n",
    "\nThis is the story of another tragic episode involving a Native American tribe.  That this probably happened under other circumstances, and happened to more than the Arapaho tribe, cannot be doubted.  This is another in a  series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to  leave  us wanting more.  The characters are strong, believable, and you want the  best for all of them. The underlying plot--selling tribal babies and  telling their parents they died--is heartbreaking.  The reunion of one such  child with her father made me weep.  And Vicki\u0027s trial reconciliation with  Ben gave me hope.  This is a great work, written with deep feeling\n",
    "\nThis book was extremely well written. It\u0027s a gorgeous story and not cliched at all. What totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time, I have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20\u0027s. She most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end. For example, on page 233, \"And if all the gifts of Life are good, perhaps, too, are all the shapes she chooses to take, and which we cannot alter.\" The book is filled with hints at the time period even though, after looking at countless reviews, the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that Lud-in-the-Mist did not and it was a \"fantastical\" piece of literature. In my opinion, this book was TOTALLY based on the time period. There\u0027s even a line by the blacksmith about how since he\u0027s not \"white\" anymore he has come down in the world. If you\u0027re looking for a cultural artifact of the 20\u0027s, this is an astounding piece\n",

    "\nA team of highly respected scientists is recruited and sent on the most exciting mission of their careers - they are to explore and catalog an expansive system of tunnels and caves deep below the Earth\u0027s surface in Antarctica.  They set off on their adventure only to learn that a team, like themselves, was sent on this same mission only 3 months prior and has never been heard from again.  They also learn that what makes this set of caverns so exciting and sought after is that they contain diamonds larger and more plentiful than any mankind has ever seen.  Wealth of this sort has attracted both dedicated scientists and individuals with more menacing plans in mind.  But these dangers are nothing compared to the beasts that are native to this subterranean world who are numerous and life threatening to the mission and the team.\n\nJames Rollins\u0027 debut novel sets the stage for what has become his successful career writing scientific thrillers.

    "\nThis rather strangely titled book is a tribute to the demand for Elizabeth Bishop\u0027s work. It is a set of pieces gleaned from some 3,500 pages in the Vassar College library collection. Not exactly random (but almost) here are 108 poems, some prose, notes she took, some sketches, some facimilies of her papers, some sketches she made, and other pieces harder to describe. \n\nObviously this is a book that will appeal most to people who are already Elizabeth Bishop fans. This is more of a work in process. It tells more about her as a person, it illustrates the great effort she went to get her poems just right before sending them off for publication. It shows something of the way her mind worked. \n\nThe work here is not Ms. Bishop\u0027s best. It\u0027s unfinished. Some of the shorter pieces, fragments really, make you wonder where she might have taken it.\n",

    "\nI was a reasonably big fan of the \"Wizard of Oz\" when I was a kid. I\u0027d seen the Judy Garland film, the \"Return to Oz\" film, my parents had taken me to a theatre production, and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. Here in Australia, though, you don\u0027t see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books, and I missed out on all that as a kid. I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story, and I really liked it. It\u0027s really a shame I couldn\u0027t find it earlier.\n\nDorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. In the midst of a \"cyclone\", Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz, a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures, good and bad witches, and a very famous wizard. Dorothy tries to find her way home, and on the way makes many new friends, like the Scarecrow, \"Tin Woodsman\" and the cowardly lion. Will she ever make it home?\n\nIt\u0027s rather different to the movie, I found. For one, the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days, whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here, and not ruby red like in the film. There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book, like the queen of the mice, the Hammerheads, and the Dainty China people. Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film, it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. Oz has a nice atmosphere too, I thought. It\u0027s very cosy and familiar, and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain, if that makes any sense. North, south, east, west... in Oz\u0027s every direction there\u0027s a new land to explore. You never know who you might meet, or how they\u0027ll do things there. I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz. The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak, for instance.\n\nI enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too, like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west, which is all described here. That reminds me, there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here, but nothing worse than you might find in \"Little Red Riding Hood\".\n\nAll in all, a great read, I thought. Whimsical, colourful and fun. I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books. Good thing there\u0027s amazon\n",

    "\nWe know some things about Saul of Tarsus (later named the Apostle Paul) but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information. Most everything we know from Paul is from the Dr. Luke in the Book of Acts or Paul\u0027s epistles themselves.  II Peter Chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements.  Peter, in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom, validates Paul\u0027s apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them. \n\nPollock\u0027s book is presented as documentary-style reading since Paul\u0027s complete biography is not entirely clear.  There is much the author states is inference or speculation. If you can respect that and not build doctrine and facts on where the evidence is fuzzy, I think this is an excellent book.\n\nOne example of \"fuzzy\" facts that Pollock considers is the age-old controversy over the authorship of the Book of Hebrews.  The author of Hebrews does not identify himself and scholars argue who wrote it.  Pollock speculates that Paul, while imprisioned in Acts Ch. 24 for two years may have had time and motivation to write the book to the people he so desparately wanted to reach.  With his imprisonment and his controversial style among the Jews, he may have left his identity anonymous so he himself would not be a stumbling block to reach his Jewish brothers.  Eternity will reveal who wrote the Book of Hebrews but it is certainly a plausible theory.\n\nOverall, the greatest benefit in reading this book is to provide a better framework for understanding Paul as he travels among the early churches and wrote letters to them correcting the various false teachings and problems that developed.\n",

    "\nThis is the first novel by Philip Roth that I actually like.  Portnoy\u0027s Complaint was a good hundred-page novella, spread out over a three-hundred page book; the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions, and his kvetching about his parents.  Operation Shylock was also too pre-occupied with pushing a political agenda (but just what agenda, we are never sure).  This is Roth\u0027s primary fault as an author - he is too didactic.  I find that I really don\u0027t care much about what Roth\u0027s political opinions are.  Ironically, this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling - it shows that he thinks \"deep thoughts.\"\n\nThe Professor of Desire is blessedly free of politics.  In it, Roth sticks with the subjects he knows best: sex and relationships.  Young David Kepesh is a sexually frustrated young student.  That changes while studying abroad in Swinging London, where he finds that what they say about Swedish girls is true.  Things take a turn for the worse after the end of his disastrous marriage finds him crushed by loneliness in New York.  With the help of a psychiatrist, Kepesh tries to discover if he will ever be able to commit to anyone or experience happiness.\n\nThe Professor of Desire finds Roth at a more mature place in his career.  Gone is the odious kvetching about his parents that polluted so much of Portnoy\u0027s Complaint; the parents in this book are treated with sympathy.  At one point, a character points out to Kepesh that there is no point in mining the workings of a Jewish family for his fiction anymore.  He is also less homophobic in this novel - but not much so.  There are still things about Roth\u0027s style that take getting used to; I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything profound in his refusal to offset dialogue into separate paragraphs - it just makes it harder to keep track of who is speaking.  However, The Professor of Desire is a short, lyrical novel that is the best of anything I\u0027ve read of his so far.\n",

    "\nHugh Hewitt is right on target encouraging Republicans to remain loyal to President George W. Bush.  We are confronted with a long term fight against Islamic nihilists.  The Democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s.  Indeed, if the Democratic Party returns to power, the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost.  Even theological modernists like myself recognize that the Republican Party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order.  And yes, we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like Senator Lincoln Chafee.  But what about the Republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands?  These folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006.  Many of them possess a suicidal Nietzschean streak.  In their heart of hearts, they idiotically believe we should let the Democrats win so that the Republican Party can be \"purified.\"  The author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis.  Hopefully, he starts to do so real soon before it\u0027s too late.\n\nThe crybaby Republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue.  A number of them come across as nativists who despise Hispanics.  We cannot, however, forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often American Citizens.  They get to vote at the age of 18---and will most certainly seek revenge on the GOP for harassing their parents.  Let\u0027s get something straight: we are also not going to send an estimated 10-12 million people back to their original homeland.  But aren\u0027t these individuals breaking the law?  Human law is not about the striving for utopian perfection.  Yucky sausage making compromises are occasionally required.  I may have a few complaints about Hugh Hewitt\u0027s newest book.  Still, you need to purchase a copy.  His overall advice is indispensable if you truly love your family and wish to protect the United States from ruin. \n\nDavid Thomson\nFlares into Darkness\n",

However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime.  The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime.  Sam\u0027s grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from \"death row.\" The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution.

    "\nThis is wonderful! It is for fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder, and also for those who are interested in historic cooking - from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled America in the early days, and adapted for use there\n\nThis book is a very happy blend of the Laura Ingalls stories and the food which was eaten, interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked. Of course Laura didn\u0027t include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day. It has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures.\n\nI found this book so lovely to read through, not just browse through. The interest factor is great - learning what things were available, and how they were used - baking soda, yeasts, how the oven was used, what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget - seasonal food avaialble. But it is good as a simple recipe book.

    "\nBlanchard and Hybels and Hodges team up for an excellent perspective on leadership from a Christian point of view. While reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership, they put together an excellent framework for leadership. The summary checklist, given on pp. 171ff., offer a helpful concise summary of the book. The glaring omission, and one that I can\u0027t believe that Hybels would make, is to clearly point out that following Jesus\u0027 style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with Jesus, in other words, you can\u0027t lead like Jesus if you don\u0027t have him in your life to help you. I can\u0027t believe that there wasn\u0027t at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further. I believe that the authors are posturing too much to get the secular audience to read the book. But for the Christian, it is an excellent book\n",
    "\nMany novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of \"passing\". These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can \"pass\" for white.  Among other things, novels based on a theme of \"passing\" allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.\n\nBoth white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of \"passing\".  The earliest novel involving \"passing\" of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book, \"An Imperative Duty\" which dealt with an inter-racial marriage.  The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled \"Passing\" set in the Harlem Renaissance.  More recently, Philip Roth\u0027s novel \"The Human Stain\" involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk, a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.\n\nColeman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnson\u0027s only novel, \"The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man\" written in 1912.  The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual, like Roth\u0027s character Coleman Silk, with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an, apparently, white person and his strong sense of black identity.  Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of \"passing\", Johnson\u0027s protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American. Johnson\u0027s short novel is, to my mind, the best written on the theme of \"passing\", and it is a fine novel indeed. The book initially was published anonymously.  The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914.  Many years later, Johnson wrote his own autobiography, titled \"Along This Way\" in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the \"Autobiography\".\n\nJohnson\u0027s story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth, both internally and in the outward events of life, about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world.  He ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy. In addition to the story line of the book, Johnson uses the \"passing\" theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the United States early in the 20th Century.  The most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a \"smoking car\" for whites on a train in the segregated South.  He participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the \"race question\" as it was viewed at the time.  There is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching, the burning alive of a black person.  Johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of anti-lynching legislation in Congress.\n\nBut Johnson\u0027s novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues.  The book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth Century America -- in the South and in Johnson\u0027s beloved New York City.  The book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both South and North.  It is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music.  Most strikingly, the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime, which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared.  Johnson shows great appreciation for this product of American culture.\n\nThe book also illustrates some universal themes.  The protagonist is troubled, specifically, by the conflict between his identity as an African-American and his wish to succeed as a white person.  But the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of self-knowledge, the role of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race.  Johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of \"passing\".\n\nJohnson\u0027s novel is an important work of American fiction which deserves to be read.\n",
    "\nYou, the reader, are the subject and the hero of Calvino\u0027s novel, an exercise in reader-response theory gone mad. Calvino\u0027s lively experiment begins by describing a reader (that is, \"you\") reading Calvino\u0027s novel and, after this opening, \"you\" settle in to read the novel that you were \"meant\" to be reading--a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter. \n\nBut all is not fair in the Land of Fiction; the copy of the book has been misbound by the printer, so you have to rush to the store to get a properly printed book--only to find that the replacement is a different book entirely. After several tricks and machinations, you end up reading the beginnings of ten different books, written in ten different styles, yet all sharing place and character names and even themes. (Part of the fun is identifying the author being imitated: the most obvious segments mock Borges, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov.)  While initially it seems that Calvino assumes you are male, soon you are introduced to the Other Reader and \"you\" see the story through her eyes. Both of you work to solve the mystery of the erratic book passages, and the pleasure of reading is heightened by romantic tensions between the two of you.\n\t\nThe book alternates between the story fragments and the story of \"you.\" The repeated changes and interruptions in style and story can be baffling: \"You can\u0027t get your bearings: the characters have changed, the settings, you don\u0027t understand what it\u0027s about, you find names of people and don\u0027t know who they are.\" It\u0027s a bit like \"Groundhog Day,\" except that instead of being stuck inside the same day, you\u0027re doomed to repeat ten different but terrifyingly similar acts of literature interruptus. \n\nWell before the end of the novel, you realize that the real story is not to be found in any of the parodies (mysteries, fantasies, and romances) that you desperately try (and fail) to finish, but in the story of your reading experience itself--an experience made all the more complicated by the web of conspiracies engendered by the Other Reader, a reclusive popular writer, a charlatan churning out counterfeit books under the writer\u0027s name, a sloppy and conniving translator, and various officials of repressive dictatorships.\n\nFor the reader who doesn\u0027t mind when an author attempts to describe your state of mind, Calvino\u0027s novel can be pure fun. The success of Calvino\u0027s task depends in no small part on whether the reading experience he describes recalls how you read a book; I know that some readers find some of these passages alien (\"That\u0027s not how I read books\"), but for me the various descriptions of the reading experience were both perceptive and eerily familiar. This reader, too, found the first half of the book far more engaging than the second half; later in the book, the gimmick inevitably wears a little thin and the detours that spoof publishing conglomerates, repressive governments, and state censorship were a bit more than this short novel could handle. And the \"solution\" to the puzzle, although fitting, has the oomph of the finale to a shaggy-dog story. No matter--if you enjoy metafiction, you might just recognize yourself in this clever book\n",

    "\nDeadly feasts: tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by Richard Rhodes is one scary book. It tracks the discovery of prions, the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease, scrapie, and Creutzfeldt Jacob disease. Following human cannibals in the jungles of New Guinea in the fifties, bovine cannibals of the British Isles in the eighties, and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on, Rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases. I especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists, from the Noble Laureate who so enjoyed the New Guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation, yet brought thirty natives back to the USA and helped them through school, to the hyper-competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he wasn\u0027t quite certain what they were. \n\nBut this isn\u0027t just a story of scientific discovery. As the foreboding subtitle blares, Rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions. These include spontaneous formation, responsible for the known early cases of Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, trans-species infection, including mad cow disease and scrapie, the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response, and hardiness of the disease. One scary factoid: a scientist took a sample of scrapie, froze it, baked it for an hour at 360 degrees (celsius), and was able to re-infect other animals from this sample. \n\nFor all the uneasiness this book inspires, it certainly doesn\u0027t offer any answers. A condemnation of industrial agriculture, a warning that it\u0027s unknown whether vegetarians are even safe, and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue. To be fair, it was printed in 1997--perhaps things are under control now. \n\n",

    "\nHaving spent the last year in the Near East, I found that reading this book gave me an incite that was most helpful to me and my collegues.  While this book was written about the Isreal-Lebanon issue during the 1970\u0027s-1980\u0027s, though it just reared its ugly head once again in the last few months, it was as I said a great help to me to understand or at least better understand the arabic way of life and culture.  With the world attention squarely on the Near East we all, weather American, European, or other cultures throughout the world, need to know and understand the Near Eastern mentality, culture, and to some extend how the Islamic Religion plays into the everyday life and politics of that area.  With this book being written by a Jewish American and with Thomas Freidman\u0027s understanding of the Near East way of thinking gives the book a credibility others could only hope for.  I recommend this book to anyone that is a student of the Near East, Politicians and Military Personnel, Religious Leaders, and anyone who wants a better understanding of the Near East in general.    \n",
    "\nI just finished reading The Handyman\u0027s Dream, By Nick Poff. I was completely blown away! This is a great book. Its about 2 guys who meet one another in small town Indiana. After the first chapter you will want to have these fellas over for dinner. The story is very well written and has alot of innovative things in it that I havent seen in any other gay novels. I love the way the author integrates Music and songs into the story. From the Character Norma ( ed\u0027s Mother)and her quirky comebacks to the wonderful Mrs. Penfield, the novel will have you laughing and will touch a place deep inside you that few books do. This story also tells of the fears and struggles a gay couple had in the past, and one many still have today. I love the fact that its very g rated and a good read for not only gay folks but also straight folks...Anyone who believes in the power of love. I wish while growing up I would have had a book like this one to show me that there IS such a thing as good , healthy gay relationships.  I Highly recommend The Handyman\u0027s Dream. \n",

    "\nThis is not a book about management.  It is a wonderful exploration about how and why groups of individuals can and do make better decisions than individuals.  It sets out some necessary conditions for this wisdom to be able to take place and then does some excellent analysis of why that happens.  \n\nWhat I got out of this book was some very important ideas about why collaborative decision making is important and how to assure that it is done well (If you want the other side Irving Janis\u0027 old classic on Groupthink is a good counterpoint.)  \n\nUnlike a lot of other big idea books this one is very literate and readable.  It is a joy to read but it also offers some very substantive ideas\n",

It\u0027s a valuable addition to any costume library\n",
    "\nTo put this review into perspective for you, it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years.  I have been focusing on Italian food for the last 10 years.  My favorite cookbook is \"The Professional Chef\" by the Culinary Institute of America. \n\nIf you are a serious home cook you will love this book.\n\nThe photography in this book is nice and the food styling is beautiful. If you love to entertain and/or you want the meals you serve your family and friends to be gorgeous you will get so many ideas reading this book.\n\nThe directions for the recipes are very thorough and well written.  I believe that a serious beginner could follow these recipes without a problem.\n\nI have tried many of the recipes in this book all to rave reviews.  I particularly enjoyed the chapter on foams. The \"cream whippers\" are expensive, but they are extremely fun to use.  \n\nThis book does not need to be used just for small bites.  It is as simple as just making fewer portions from the same recipe. \n\nThis book is highly recommended for anyone that is serious about cooking.\n",

    "\nWith \"Dead Watch\", Sanford has delivered a political thriller that is fully worthy of mention alongside his popular police-procedural Prey series.  I share the Booklist reviewer\u0027s sentiment that Sandford has produced a D.C. intrigue reminiscent of Ross Thomas (a VERY good thing!).  \n\nMy biggest beef with Dead Watch is the bland characterization of Jake Winter (though Sandford does do a good job of making Winter not be Lucas Davenport); nearly every other character has more personality-pizzazz.  Not to worry though, the Madison Bowe character and the breakneck speed of the story more than make up for that shortcoming.  If I\u0027d been turning pages any faster, I\u0027d have probably started a fire.\n",
    "\nCharlie Bone isn\u0027t your typical nine-year-old boy.  Although he didn\u0027t know that himself.  But when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him, he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever.  Tracking down the picture, Charlie finds out it belongs to Miss Ingledew, a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years.  She gives Charlie a mysterious package (that he can\u0027t open) and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world.  As it turns out, Charlie is one of the descendants of the Red King, a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding.  The Red King\u0027s children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since.  At Bloor\u0027s Academy, Charlie finds friends and enemies, and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others don\u0027t want revealed.\n\nJenny Nimmo is the author of five books in the Charlie Bone series and has written several other children\u0027s books and fantasies.\n\nMany people compare Charlie Bone to Harry Potter, and that\u0027s a good comparison.  But the two series are different.  Harry\u0027s family is really non-supportive, but Charlie has a loving mother, a doting grandmother, and Uncle Paton, who turns out to be something of a hero.  The book is a fun, fast-paced whirlwind of mysteries, magic, and friendship.  Even at 400 pages, it feels like it\u0027s over much too soon.\n\nThere are a few jarring instances where the point-of-view was disconnected, moving from one character and one scene into another without warning.  They were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story, but noticeable all the same.\n\nFans who are waiting for the next Harry Potter book who haven\u0027t tried the Charlie Bone series are encouraged to do so.  Charlie\u0027s story, although similar, has much to offer in reading excitement\n",

    "\nMr. Bones is a very special dog, a dog who understands Ingloosh and almost speaks it. A dog who is happy roaming about the country with his master, Willie G. Christmas. If Willie is homeless, probably schizophrenic, certainly eccentric; if they rarely have enough to eat; if he doesn\u0027t always understand Willie\u0027s metaphysical ramblings--what does that matter between a dog and his best friend? Alas, in the first chapter, Willie is coughing up blood, and Mr. Bones knows that Willie is going to die.\n\nThe entire story is told through the point of view of this remarkable dog. Is it the story of a dog? Or the story of Willie? Or the story of life in America? Or a story about love, alienation, betrayal and loss? Well, it\u0027s all of these. And what is Timbuktu? For that, you will have to read the book. I\u0027m not going to tell you.\n\nAuthor Paul Auster is a genius with language. Somehow he draws you into this improbable story and makes it believable. More than believable. Compelling. Does he really get inside the mind of a dog? Who am I to say? I can only say that for me he makes the mind of a dog as believable and understandable as any other mind. \n\nSome reviewers expressed disappointment with this book, but I thought it was wonderful. Just let it speak in its own voice and take it for what it is and you will love it. I recommend Timbuktu highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber\n",

    "\nI saw the second title of this series at my local Borders bookstore, and decided to try the first title.

    "\nWhen Peter S. Lynch speaks, wise investors will listen.  This book covers the famous fund manager\u0027s career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to \u002790, and post career into \u002792.  It\u0027s far more introspective than \"One Up On Wall Street\" and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose.  For example, there isn\u0027t nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former.  My belief is that the reader would do best by reading \"One Up On Wall Street\" first and follow up with this title, as its the newer of the two, regardless. \n\nPeter\u0027s style of writing (with John Rothchild) is no-nonsense and easy to take in.  To my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry.  The reader can comfortably take in some very important stock-picking principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point.  I think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that isn\u0027t child\u0027s play (unless you like playing with money).\n\nAnd although this book doesn\u0027t cover nearly as much technical information as the first, it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers.  I made plenty of notes while reading \"Beating The Street\", and I\u0027m confident that I\u0027ll be well served by doing so.  Peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first best-seller, such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets, and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower P/Es than their growth rates.\n\nOverall, this title definitely deserves four stars, and his first book deserves at least five stars.  Lynch and Rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time. You\u0027ll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "\n               Lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach ,used by Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of ,primarily, on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers.\n             This approach generated a number of divisional championships for Oakland in the weakest American League division,but no pennants and world championships.There are omitted variables and misspecification  problems in the sabermetrics(statistics) approach of Bill James used by Beane.First,James\u0027s system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts.All outs are not equal.Hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base.Hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error.Strikeouts are thus the worst type of out.This omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1  to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over,say,100 for a regular,everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the season.The second problem is that the James system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays,especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball outs.Another category is needed-walks that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts and/or walks where the runner is able to steal second base.These walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out 150+ times a year and hits .250 but has a .375 OBP.\n        James\u0027s system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors\n",

    "\nBackground\t\n\tI read Isaac\u0027s Storm, by Erik Larson, around 1998. Recently I had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review. Larson covered three killer hurricanes, two killer blizzards and one flash flood.\n\t\t\nGalveston and related Hurricanes\n\tMy first impression was that anyone who had read this book, about a major hurricane, would never consider riding out such a storm. Larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters. \nIsaac Cline was the U. S. Weather Service Chief at Galveston at this time. This book gives much detail on the Galveston storm. This hit the island in September 1900, with very little warning. Indeed it was the arrogance of the U. S. Weather Service in general, and Issac Cline, their station chief for this area, in particular, that essentially preempted any warning. \"Cline was one of the \u0027new men\u0027, a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms.\" First, the U. S. Weather Service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from Cuba. The U. S. Weather Service had men stationed in Cuba who \"said the storm was nothing to worry about.\" Cuban\u0027s \"own weather observers, who had pioneered hurricane detection, disagreed.\" Secondly the U. S. Weather Service insisted that, any storm warning had to come from the Washington office, with absolutely no exceptions. Finally Isaac had the conviction, and public position, that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. With such a position Cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters. \n\tLarson cited two older hurricanes in his book. \n* September 16, 1875 - \"The storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through Indianola, pushing the waters of the Gulf and Matagorda Bay inland until for 20 miles the back country prairie was an open sea.\" This storm took 176 lives.\n* August 20, 1886 - This storm completed the destruction of Indianola. So many residents were killed that the survivors abandoned the town completely.\n\tIn 1891, \"in the wake of a tropical storm that Galveston weathered handily\" Cline  was asked to appraise the city\u0027s vulnerability to extreme weather. Isaac wrote: \"The opinion held by some - - - that Galveston at some time will be seriously damaged by some such disturbance is simply an absurd delusion.\" He made this statement in spite of the fact that the maximum elevation of Galveston Island, at that time, was an almost trivial 8.7 feet above sea level. He made it also in spite of the two killer hurricanes hitting and destroying the town of Indianola, about 150 miles southwest of Galveston on Matagorda Bay.\n\tCline had a \"model\" of Gulf hurricanes, namely that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. His \"model\" of these storms was clearly fatally flawed, or politically influenced, and it resulted in 6,000 to 10,000 deaths. \n\tLarson suggests there was a \"scent of boosterism\" behind this article, and that he was writing an article that Galveston promoters would be happy to see. Could this have been a harbinger of things to come? Could Cline have been the first government weather scientist to prostitute himself by writing favorable papers on the weather for his sponsors?\n\tThen the storm hit. Both the U. S. Weather Service and Isaac Cline looked very arrogant before the storm, and also in defending their overall performance, after the storm.\n\nOther extreme weather events \n\tLarson also covered two blizzards and one flash flood in his book in this book.\n* Hail and flash flood, August 1885 - \"a severe downpour near San Angelo, including hailstones the size of ostrich eggs, killed hundreds of cattle and created a flash flood with An escarpment of water that Isaac estimated to be 15 or 20 feet high.\"\n* Blizzard, November 1888 - this surprise blizzard destroyed 150 vessels off New England, and caused the death of 450.\n* Blizzard, January 1899 - \"this blizzard swept much of the South. Icebergs 10 feet high flowed down the Mississippi past New Orleans.\" This storm even hit Galveston and piled snow on it\u0027s beaches and drove water out of the Bay into the Gulf exposing portions of the bay bottom.\n\nConclusion\n\tIsaac\u0027s Storm shows the incredoble wrath of hurricanes, 105 to 125  years ago. It also depicts the incredible spectrum of extreme weather events, also of the same vintage. All in all a most interesting and rewarding book, one that I would recommend highly.\n",
    "\nTerrier will not disappoint Tamora Pierce fans!  The narration is done through first person, told as a journal.  This is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story, and difficult to account for actions the narrator hasn\u0027t seen. But Tamora has performed her usual magic, snatching up the readers\u0027 interest from the first page and holding it until the last (I even read all of the notes pages and the bio).  Readers may find it difficult to put down.  Once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo\n",
    "\nThis is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough \"inside details\" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham\u0027s writings makes for a very enjoyable read.\nOne of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all.\n\nOverall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham\u0027s other books. So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Read and enjoy\n",

However, the best stories I found were the ones such \"Season\u0027s Greetings to our Friends and Family!!!\" which I had to think about before fully understanding and laughing at their humor.  I would definitely like to read more of Sedaris\u0027 works, especially those based on his real-life experiences as, overall, I found the collection of essays in this book more entertaining than the stories\n",

    "\nYou know that guy down the street who acts awful snake-like?  What about the cashier at Walmart who is catty?  And there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys.  Neil Gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize.   In this novel, gods (which represent animals) roam the earth in the bodies of humans.  The main character is the clever, trouble-loving spider who interacts with other animal-gods in everyday human life.  This book, along with other science fiction books, has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination. \n\nThe strong point of this novel is the humor employed by Neil Gaiman.  On par with Douglas Adams, the author of Anasi Boys fills the pages with quirky, pop-culture laden humor.  The main character, Fat Charlie, I found much in common with.  His awkward moments with friends, family and everyone else reveal a social insecurity that many are familiar with.  The story, however, isn\u0027t anything special.  I like witches and animal-gods as much as the next guy, but the plot is uninteresting.  It is a rare book that combines wit with plot, and this is not one of those rare books. \n",

    "\nThe use of an Integrated Development Environment [IDE] for a user to learn a language in, and to then program within, is well known. Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE. \n\nThe twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span. \n\nSqueak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages. Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.\n\nI wonder a little about the book itself, though. A motivated high school student could easily use it. But for some younger students? In that situation, it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher, who can then instruct from it\n",

    "\nIn this fascinating collection of essays, Dr. Dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis. Over the last twenty-five years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies, an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms, subsidised housing, free by-weekly pay checks, child support and free medical benefits. From a liberal political standpoint, this support for the nation\u0027s \"have nots\" is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor. One would logically assume that providing the poor with life\u0027s essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society. In fact, as Dalrymple proposes, it has had an opposite effect: crime in his native England has skyrocketed; drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence. Why? Liberal values not economics has created individuals that deny any responsibility for their own lives, it is always the rich, the government or societies institutions that is to blame, thus crime continues to rise while England\u0027s Welfare State has grown into an unwieldy Goliath.  \n\nDalrymple has worked in numerous countries and has been an attending physician and psychiatric consultant in London\u0027s prisons for many years. Thus his thesis is not born from some abstract social theory about human behaviour. He has treated thousands of victims of domestic violence, consulted thousands of prisoners who have been incarcerated for petty crime to murder. The common thread that runs through all these cases is a pathological denial of responsibility for their own circumstances or conditions. \n\nAs Dalrymple explains:\n\n\"Like so many modern ills, the coarseness of spirit and behaviour grows out of ideas brewed up in the academy and among intellectuals - ideas that have seeped outward and are now having their practical effect on society. The relativism that has ruled the academy for many years has now come to rule the mind of the population.\" (P.85)\n\nIn other words, this post modern notion that there is no high and low art, no good and bad, no subtlety and crudeness, only relative perspectives; taking this further, our behaviour too is not individually determined, but society and its oppressive inequalities that make me who I am, and a biological predisposition which causes me to steal from the old lady next door, beat my wife beyond recognition and consume drugs and alcohol like there is no tomorrow. The trickling down of these academic theories, biological determinism, Marxism and the post modern theory that there are no levels of hierarchical values, only difference, has created an underclass of victims who believe they should get something for nothing and commit crime because society has created them as victims as self-determinism does not exist.\n\nDalrymple provides numerous real life examples from his practice working in a hospital in London. His writing style is straight forward, at times literary but never sentimental. The arguments in these essays are persuasive and push the reader to examine the underlying modern ideologies that have created and sustain a well provided for underclass of criminal \"victims\". \n",
    "\nThis is a pretty good book.  However, I would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of Lincoln\u0027s depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective\n",
    "\nA fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.  Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him. \nIt\u0027s a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as \"Maximum Bob\" and \"Stick\" but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick).\nI thought this was his best since \"Striptease.\" The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although I\u0027m a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.  Incidentally, isn\u0027t releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no? \n",
    "\nI really don\u0027t understand all the negative reviews about this book.  I found it an easy to read pleasant mystery, with a main character in midlife turmoil I wanted to sympathize with.  J. A. Jance did an excellent job keeping the pace reasonably fast, while not losing the reader with extraneous characters. \n",
    "\nIn the month that I have been puting the teaching into practice,I have felt better like I haven\u0027t felt in eleven years. My weight is going down and my energy is increasing. I am getting a lot of compliments, and someone told me I look more like 31 than 51 which is my real age\n",
    "\nThis is a simple, yet heartfelt and elegant tale of the lives and struggles of women in rural China of the 1920s and 1930s. The story centers on Pei, who as a young girl, is sold by her parents to work in a silk factory.  The story evolves as Pei befriends other women in the silk factory, participates in a strike for fair working conditions, reconnects with her family, loses loved ones, and escapes from advancing Japanese soldiers. The plot is succinct and the characters are interesting, varied, and believable, if perhaps lacking somewhat in psychological depth.  Socio-cultural aspects of life in 1920s-30s China are elegantly woven into the plot.  Themes of friendship, love, and courage are convincingly presented.  Overall, the book is a captivating read, and strongly recommended. \n",
    "\nThis thing sat on my shelf, half-read for the longest time.  Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchon\u0027s next got me motivated enough to dig into it again.  It\u0027s not that it isn\u0027t brilliant.  No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder.  The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you\u0027ll ever read.\n\nAnd it\u0027s not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into.  There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravity\u0027s Rainbow before catching the wave.  \n\nBut Mason and Dixon is a lot of work, if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the mid-18th century prose style.  (Can you imagine the effort it took to produce it?)  John Barth\u0027s Sotweed Factor is  similar, and yet somehow infinitely more accessible (and highly recommended!).  Pynchon\u0027s gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness.  Especially in a work this voluminous.\n\nAnd yet the darn thing is consistently challenging, if one has the patience and energy to put into it.  It seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts, but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book, and the emotional satisfaction one gain\u0027s when reaching towards the conclusion.  One thing for sure, for once Pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work, as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension (which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels).  This time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players.  \n\nThis book is a great as you want it to be, if you\u0027re willing to work at it.  I\u0027m just looking forward to the next one being a little more nimble.  (Meanwhile, I\u0027ve got a couple months to see if I can make more of a dent into The Recognitions.\n",
    "\nThis is a great book.  I will not go into so much detail as the previous reviewers, but I must give credit where it is due.  Having read many books on the subject of the Bush White House including, \"Fiasco,\" and \"State of Denial,\" I did not think I would learn much more from this one.  I bought the book a few days ago, mainly because I like David Corn.  When I read it I was pleasantly surprised at how insightful it is.  I think along with the two books I mentioned earlier, this trio make up the essential reading on Bush, Iraq, and everything that can be encompassed in those broad categories.  If you could only read one, I would call it a dead heat between, \"Hubris,\" and, \"State of Denial.\"  If pressed I suppose I would have to give the edge to Hubris, as the writing was much less tedious I thought.  \n",
    "\nThis audio-book was fantastic. It took off like a horse out of the starting gate at the Kentucky Derby and never let up.\n\nVincente Callabrese is a part time enforcer/collector for the mob and part time movie producer student. When Vincente is asked to produce one of his classmates screen plays this is a start of a new career for Vincente.\n\nFirst a name change, from Vincente Callabrese to Michael Vincent. Then it\u0027s off to Hollywood where he rapidly becomes one of the hottest producers in the movie business.\n\nUnfortunately, Michael has a hard time shaking his past. When he tries to buy the movie rights to a novel and is refused, he asks his old friend Tommy Povenzano for help. Tommy assures Michael the he will help. This is the start of all of Michael\u0027s problems.\n\nIn typical Woods fashion this novel is a mover. Though this novel isn\u0027t full of excitement, it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next. It doesn\u0027t take long between incidents.\n\nThe bottom line here is that this is a book not to be missed.\n\nChoke \nDead In the Water\nOrchid Beach\n\nThese are all other options by Mr. Stuart and I would recommend any of them.\n\nThough this book has not won any awards Mr. Woods won the Edgar Alan Poe award in 1982 and was nominated again in 1992. Once you have read or listened to this book you will understand why.\n",
    "\nAmy Tan writes about wonderful people. \n\nAmy Tan creates exceptional characters.\n\nAmy Tan will write you a story that is so rich and clear you can almost touch it.\n\nThat is what I love in reading Amy Tan. As your average southern white female, I\u0027m not exactly versed in the world of Amy Tan\u0027s characters. But she takes me there. I find myself so completely involved in the world she writes about that I forget where I am. Isn\u0027t that why you pedalled your bicycle to the library in the summer when you were a kid? Amy Tan will remind you of that sense of discovery you had back then, when you were reading all the great classics for the first time and the discovery of it all was an addictive thrill that kept your library card smoking and well worn with use.\n\nShe has a gift in her storytelling for expanding the universe. Read this book.\n",
    "\nI fail to understand the complaints of two previous reviewers. This beautiful glossy volume is an excellent compendium of previosly publisned Cook\u0027s Illustrated  recipes. In style and format it would make an excellent first choice for anyone wishing to be introduced to a selection of the best of the best recipes from America\u0027s Teet Kitchen (i. e. Cook\u0027s Illustrated) without the tediousness of having to wade through lengthy descriptions of how the recipes were arrived at.\n\nThe cooks at America\u0027s Test Kitchen test each recipe up to fifty! times, often in several versions before arriving at the what they (and their taste testers) feel is the very best recipe. No other cookbooks offer this degree of security to the home cook.\n\nChapters include: Starters and Salads, Soups and Stews, Vegetables and Side Dishes, Eggs and Breads, Pasta, Meat, Poultry, Seafood, and Desserts. Throughout, are guides and charts to everything from grains to the best bakeware (also kitchen tested). The recipes range from familiar comfort food (e. g. Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes, Glazed Meatloaf, and Deep-dish Apple Pie) to \"show-off\" company fare (e.g. Baked Brie en Croute, Grill-roasted Chinese Style Duck, and Dark Chocolate Mousse). \n\nIf your looking for recipes that work everytime, do yourself a favor and purchase any Cook\u0027s Illustrated cookbook, including this one.

    "\nThis Bible blew me away when I went hunting for one a few months ago to give to a youth who had come into my life.  I was so impressed, I  bought one for myself.  This Bible is many things, but the first thing that I noticed, quite honestly, is that the colors were bright, the print readable, and the illustrations far less serious and far more engaging than your typical Bible.  Without growing to an unwieldy size, the editors manage to throw in a wealth of study information, written in a modern, friendly style, that helps make even the dryest or most confusing parts of the Good Book both understandable and relevant to today\u0027s society.  That is what makes it perfect for someone, like my young friend, who is unfamiliar with religion, Christianity, or just plain old Bible study.  It\u0027s less intimidating that most Bibles and all material is presented in such a manner that you don\u0027t feel \"unprepared\" if you pick it up cold.  Catholics are often les familiar with the Bible than many Protestant denominations, as we have a wholistic focus that is both valuable and worthwhile--however, a better relationship and understanding of the Word can only enhance one\u0027s spiritual life and experience as a Catholic.  If that applies to you (which, I have to admit, it did to me) this is a wonderful way to get your feet wet in Biblical translation, discussion, interpretation, and modern relevance.  Who won\u0027t like this Bible?  1 - Those more familiar and attached to more formal translations such as the King James Version 2 - Those already familiar with intensive Bible study, IF not working with youth or those less familiar 3 - most Protestants...the discussion is from a very clear Catholic viewpoint...not really controversial, just Catholic 4 - and traditionalists who are offended by the idea of making the Bible \"accessible\" and \"relevant\" through use of the lingo/parlance and point of view of today\u0027s under-25 set.  I believe one reviewer felt that the Bible didn\u0027t need to be made culturally relevant, finding the sidebars on race, cultural differences, modern morality, and varying interpretations to be just another extension of the \"Political Correctness\" movement. I couldn\u0027t disagree more.  The Bible should be the one book that everyone can \"see themselves\" in should they seek such a thing.  This Bible does that for a new generation of Catholics and for a new, hesitant group of explorers.  I\u0027d ballpark the appropriate age for this version at around 13-35 years\n",

    "\nIn his book Trading Risk, Ken Grant draws upon his experience as a risk manager for Tudor Investments and SAC Capital to create an insightful and surprisingly non-technical guide for traders and portfolio managers.  As Director of Trader Development at a large proprietary trading house, I have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders.  Moreover, this is a scalable difference: risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades, results of trading days, and performance across entire quarters.  Where I believe Grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply \"cutting your losses\".  Trading Risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades, from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades and the use of correlation analysis in evaluating trading results.  His discussions of adjusting portfolio exposure and evaluating the risk components of individual trades are highly practical and encourage a rigor of self-analysis that is rarely practiced.\n\nPerhaps an example from my own work with traders that overlaps Grant\u0027s ideas might be illustrative.  I encourage traders to keep a log of all their trades that tracks time of day, position taken, position size, holding period, and profit/loss (P/L).  Changes to the position are also documented, as traders scale into or out of trades.  From this record, we can evaluate a host of performance statistics, such as position sizing as a function of market volume/volatility, the correlation of profitability with trade size/holding period, and patterns of activity within the trading day.  While Grant\u0027s background is with portfolio management-appropriate to a manager who is holding a basket of positions in a variety of equities-his ideas are easily adaptable to the intraday trader who is trading a single instrument.  By viewing each trade during a day as an element of that day\u0027s \"portfolio\", we can ask important questions about the mix of position sizes, overall directional bias, and the management of volatility as a function of trade capital/loss limits.     \n\nWritten in an engaging style with bits of humor interspersed, Trading Risk ends with a practical chapter that summarizes the book\u0027s major points.  He explains the importance of developing and modifying trading plans, defining one\u0027s trading \"edge\", judiciously allocating risk capital, and improving performance \"at the margin\".  This latter point is a particularly neglected element in risk management.  For the active, large trader, the ability to squeeze the extra tick out of trades is frequently the difference between a winning day and a losing one.  Superior traders have an ability to read the very short-term patterns of price change and momentum to determine when it is prudent to hit the bid or let the market go offer in exiting a position.  At such points, good risk management and good trading are indistinguishable.\n\nI have few reservations about Grant\u0027s book.  A text of 250 pages is not going to provide many workbook-like examples, something that would help the more mathematically challenged master the ideas of value-at-risk and correlation analysis.  Small retail traders who trade only occasionally will probably find the risk metrics less compelling than larger, active traders or portfolio managers, though the basic principles emphasized in the last chapter certainly apply to any serious trader.  Considering the absence of serious discussions of risk management in the popular trading literature, Trading Risk is a major contribution and a worthy addition to a library.  I plan to use it as a core reading in our training program for new traders, perhaps the best endorsement I can give.\n",
    "\nOnce again I am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject.  I bought this to get a better feel for the Old Testament [operative word is \"feel\"].  As a Roman Catholic, the Old Testament is addressed in the first reading at Mass, but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner.  It is particularly confusing, hard to read, and difficult to understand in proper context, without some help.  In fact there are portions of the Old Testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous.  Davis\u0027s book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people, in a certain time and place, and within a historical milieu.  It may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like, but it is sufficient to be effective.  \n\nIt is just too simplistic to look to the Bible for all answers; as if it were some sort of statutory code, with the answers to all questions.   The search and answers for truth are never ending, and the Bible is a beginning.  I get more from Catholic writers who explore the Bible and the traditions of my religion relative to our world, than I do from the book itself.  Davis is throwing in his spin, as well as a pretty accurate assessment of the Bible in historical context, which I found quite helpful.  \n\nTake it for what is worth, a spin in a convertible through the Bible.  A nice ride, but nothing more. \n",
    "\nI was fortunate enough to have seen the now-legendary Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. during the winter of 1995-96.  21 out of the 35 (or 36) extant paintings by Vermeer were included in the show, offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of Vermeer\u0027s amazing works in a single space, something that no one has experienced since 1696, when @20 of his paintings were auctioned in Delft.  Given the rarity and fragility of Vermeer\u0027s works, it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated. All who were unable to make it to the show, however, have this splendid book as a document of this unique event.  This book will remain the standard work on Vermeer for many decades, and represents the fruit of several years\u0027 labor by art historians on two continents. Because so little is in fact known about Vermeer the man (in truth, we have no idea at all what Vermeer\u0027s education, interests, and personality were like), the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing Vermeer\u0027s work within the history of Dutch painting, the development of perspective, and the fascinating tale of Vermeer\u0027s \u0026quot;rediscovery\u0026quot; in the 19th century and his richly-deserved rise to worldwide fame. The essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers, as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct Vermeer\u0027s exact technique, something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves (no drawings by Vermeer have survived, nor have any statements he may have made about painting).  This extensive scholarly apparatus, while illuminating and occasionally even riveting (the essay dealing with Vermeer\u0027s rediscovery is a great detective narrative!), tends to obscure the strange, even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with.  Vermeer\u0027s personal world - so limited in content yet unforgettably haunting and evocative - is one of stillness and peace suffused with tension.  Each image contains remarkable spatial and temporal ambiguities that make simple scenes like a lady writing a letter while her maid looks away or two people standing near a piano (The Music Lesson) vibrate with dramatic tension.  Sadly, the somewhat passionless writing encases the pictures (all of which are superbly reproduced) in a rhetoric that does not address the fundamental issue: What is it about these paintings that is so powerful that their maker was rescued from total obscurity and has inspired poetry, novels and countless studies?  I was hoping to find some discussion of the psychological meaning of these images, but the traditional (overly scholarly and dry) art history within did nothing to help me understand my passion for the \u0026quot;Sphinx of Delft.\u0026quot;  That said, the book is a masterpiece of empirical research on the artist (barring some new discovery, it is unlikely that we will ever have any more facts about Vermeer and his world than can be read here), exquisitely designed, and distinguished with beautiful reproductions.  The volume is certainly one of the few bestsellers in the field of the art book - when I attended the show, the paperback print of the book was totally sold out and the hardcover was flying off the shelves (it is odd that the book has not been reprinted in paperback).  Johannes Vermeer is THE text to have on this artist and is unlikely to be superseded anytime soon.  Immerse yourself in Vermeer\u0027s world and you will be transformed.  Seeing this exhibition changed my life, and I treasure this book as a means of recapturing the awe and joy that overwhelmed me at the time.  I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I have\n",
    "\nIn the \"New Work of Dogs,\"author Jon Katz expands his scope from focusing on his relationship with his dogs---a topic he has detailed in previous books---to examining the canine-human relationship on a broader scale.\n\nInformed by arduous research (a two foot stack of papers, books, journals), he sets out and succeeds in making a case that dogs, by-and-large, are doing different work from their traditional herding, hunting, and guarding. We have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions, therapy dogs, even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world. \n\nThe notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new, but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of \"the greatest generation\" is new (at least to me).\n\nMr. Katz visits with many dogs and their owners of various social economic strata who inhabit the enclaves of Montclair, New Jersey.  More often than not, he found that dogs are being used as emotional surrogate, a classic situation noted in attachment theory but hitherto mostly applied to other people. Many of these dogs are pampered, untrained, and confused. Others are abused to some extent, whether through deliberate actions or through negligence. \n\nThe stories are alarming and informing. I see many of the mistakes I made with previous dogs laid out before me and wonder if my two Australian shepherds are as well-adjusted as they seem. \n\nMany reviewers have commented, and correctly, that anyone planning to own a dog needs to read this book. Sadly, I think Mr. Katz will largely reach those people who already possess a great deal of knowledge about dogs---those who train their dogs, who buy or adopt breeds suitable for their living conditions or schedules, and who treat their dogs with consistent, loving authority.\n\nMr. Katz does not make harsh judgments on any of the circumstances he depicts but instead concludes by noting how many dogs are dumped in shelters where they languish or die. The numbers are staggering. \n\nAnd he takes matters a step further with the thought-provoking idea that if we have dog rescue groups, how can we not also have their counterparts to reach out to those of our own species in dire need. \n\n",

    "\n   While this book had some minor flaws (I\u0027ll discuss those briefly later), it is worth owning, especially since it is one of the few books to truly discuss the creative process of Cirque Du Soleil and how the rest of us can learn from what the performers do every day- the type of risks they take in hopes of creating magic, the beauty and spiritual resonance of their performances.\n\nThere is another book out there that explores one man\u0027s experiences with one performer and it is also intriquing but this new book reveals more about a wider variety of artists, directors, designers, etc.\n\n\n    And, for all those who\u0027ve watched and been entranced by a Cirque du Soleil performance...wouldn\u0027t we all like to create a little of that magic in our lives? Wouldn\u0027t we all like to ignite our own creative fires, even if they come out in different ways, perhaps in writing, perhaps in our work lives or the time we spend with our families or while alone.  \n\n\n   One of the main lessons I got from this book is that being fully open as possible to one\u0027s imagination, hopes, dreams and aspirations can lead in wondrous directions and affect even the most \"practical\" or mundane tasks of life. It just takes the willingness to take the risk, to accept failure and setbacks in return for spiritual and emotional growth and lifechanging experiences. \n\n   This is more than a book geared to artists and peformers. It truly is for the rest of us. It can change your life. \n\n    Having said that, I found myself wanting more, felt myself not quite fully satisfied by this book. I felt some of the sections were a little too pat or formulaic. But these are minor quibbles when the book offers so much and is one of the few  books that really explores the Cirque du Soleil creative process. Until a better one comes along, I\u0027d consider this a MUST for anyone wanting to know more about the secrets and techniques of the Cirque du Soleil \"spark\", a spark that can affect us all. \n",
    "\nYes, it\u0027s cliche. Yes, the plot is lifted directly from Star Wars. Yes, there are obvious references to Anne McCaffrey, Tolkien and other fantasy writers. But who cares?\n\nEragon is, above all else, an enjoyable read. Despite underlying flaws in the writing, Paolini effectively tells a rewarding good-versus-evil story in a clearly-defined world, with a well-thought-out magic system and a realism Tolkien could never muster. Sure, Eragon has its critics (mostly aspiring writers that have not enjoyed Paolini\u0027s success), but if you can ignore their blustering and simply take the book at face value, I think you\u0027ll be pleasantly surprised. Although not as epic or impressive as some of the older fantasy works, Eragon is nonetheless, a great read\n",
    "\nI just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to NYC from Barcelona.  My mouth watered as I read the included reprints of her past reviews of NYC restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic Spanish cuisine!  But more surprisingly, I was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the NYC restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many \"characters\".  The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience, especially in NYC\u0027s \"best\" restaurants.  Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get, I suppose) review.  A very easy and enjoyable read.\n",

    "\nGive up dieting forever! I have and I am now losing weight eating anything, yes anything, I want.  Can you imagine eating anything you want and not being frightened?  This is the book that will set you free, this is the book you need. Has it struck you that dieting is unnatural?  Don\u0027t eat this, don\u0027t eat that, count this, count that, measure this, measure that, I can\u0027t have this, and I can\u0027t have that, ad nauseum.  Which diet guru are you going to believe?  Can you reall stay with a low-carb diet or a high-carb diet or calorie counting the rest of your life?  Most importantly, do you want to stick to a restricted diet the rest of your life?  The first day of my new eating pattern I ate two meals.  The second day, I woke up with no hunger, no reactive hypoglycemia (nausea and shakes from hunger)!  What a miracle.  I have shifted to an apple for lunch and anything I want for dinner (I love to cook and desire to eat with my family).  At maintenance, I may end up eating two meals a day; I don\u0027t know and it certainly isn\u0027t something to \u0026quot;worry\u0026quot; about.  The diet gurus that say one meal will cause you to overeat later, etc., are wrong, wrong, wrong.  Maybe it sounds theoretically correct, but it does not work that way.  Listen, I have found out the less you eat, the less you eat.  I do eat to satisfaction at dinner and it does not stretch my stomach.  By the way, Dr. Dean Edell stated on his radio show that he only eats one meal a day himself.  He says there is NO scientific proof that X number of meals are better than one.  Also, I want you dear readers to know that I have four friends who are \u0026quot;naturally\u0026quot; slim (adult women - 30\u0027s and 40\u0027s). Two of them eat a small amount for lunch (like a small hamburger) and a good dinner (they are sizes 3 and 6).  One gal eats at 2:30 PM, a huge amount, and a snack at night (she is size 7).  One gal does nibble all day, like a potato chip here and there (no thank you, personally).  Oh, and a relative who is size 4 eats breakfast and dinner, never lunch.  Remember my comeback for sabotagers:  \u0026quot;Slim people don\u0027t need much food, even if we exercise.  Who says a certain number of meals a day are better than one or two?\u0026quot;  The only negative thing I have to say about Diane\u0027s book is that I felt she took scripture out of context.  God fed the Israelites manna 2X a day; they were supernaturally filled and nourished.  He does not feed anyone manna today.  Also, biblical gluttony is not overeating (I do believe a lifestyle of overeating is sin, but not gluttony).  Biblical gluttony refers to the Roman-type parties where people overate, overdrank and went on to commit more sin.  On the positive side, I do believe Diane tries steer away from legalism and authoritarianism.  This book is an answer to prayer.  You won\u0027t be sorry if you buy this book\n",

    "\nThis book provides the reader with a clear, basic understandingof the grounding of popular opinion regarding gay life during the last50 years.  While the history is too rich and detailed to be dealt within a book with this scope, this is a remarkably readable and valuable thumbnail of the currents of the public discourse on gay life, and should provide any reader with an understanding of how crucial and new gay civil rights really are.  I only hope that it will inspire others whose experience of being gay is a relatively new one to realize how important political activism and community still is.  Not only that, a very engaging read\n",

    "\nWith over 1000 recipes, this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it\u0027s paces, but I\u0027ve had great results with the few dishes I\u0027ve tried so far.  The Turkey Wraps with Chipotle Mayo rocked, with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion.  I\u0027d use that on any sandwich, anytime.  The sauces for Halibut with Spicy Asian Vinaigrette (really a sambal vinaigrette) and Wasabi Cream were awesome.  Veggie dishes like Asparagus with Shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners.  \n\nGranted, I haven\u0027t even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good!

It talks about developing interpersonal skills, public speaking skills, prospecting skills, networking etiquette, sales skills, marketing principles, and even customer service. It mentions the power of the Thank You note, and of giving more than you receive. It also devotes a chapter on some things about home-based businesses. And a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing, and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity. I\u0027m not sure the mail order chapter should have been included. Quite frankly, I think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here. And I think Chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book, and not included in this book either. But who cares! Anybody interested in the main thrust of the book (endless referrals) is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 - and they are well written and informative.\n\nWhat I liked the most about the book was the chapter summaries at the end of each chapter. I did not have to wade through the book the first time through. I just had to read the summaries. The other thing that was really nice about the book was the \"recommended reading\" sections at the end of chapters 12 through 15 and the one at the end of the book. Those booklists were very thorough and helpful. 5 stars\n",
    "\n\t\u0027Conservatives Without Conscience\u0027 does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science.  There is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science, but John Dean does a good job of explaining the basics, and how it applies to our modern political landscape. \n\n\t This is not new information, it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the Carl Rove wing of the Republican party.  The academics keep measuring and refining their understanding, and Carl Rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public.  Finally, someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see.  Knowledge is power, so everyone should read his book.  However, one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character, so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits.  They don\u0027t tend to read books much anyway.  It is a book  for the open minded, that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape,  the by any means necessary tactics of many named players, and the proto-fascist movement that has hijacked our country. \n\n\tJohn Dean pulls no punches.  He names names and kicks butt.  He gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism, but even that is well worth the effort. \n If you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the Republican party and those who  unquestionably support them, then read this book.  It is an eye opener\n",

It is a book about men written for the women who truly care about them and the relationships they have with men.  There is a companion book written about women for men appropriately titled, \"For Men Only.\"  Perhaps those who were offended by this book should give that one a try.\n\nI found this book to be both touching and challenging.

    "\nFrom the beginning, Roberto was different.  He loved his wood, but he\u0027d always rather play with his food than eat it.  More than anything he wanted to become a famous architect like his heroes, Hank Floyd Mite and Fleas Van Der Rohe.  Belittled at home by the other termites and never taken seriously, Roberto sets off for the big city to \u0026quot;build his dreams.\u0026quot;  Life in the city is hard, and not just for Roberto.  He meets all kinds of bugs with housing problems, including roaches chased from a diner, a housefly with no place to go and a poor ladybug whose house is on fire and children are gone.  Marshalling all his determination, Roberto decides to build a new community, that will meet the needs of these out-of-luck bugs and maybe make his architect dreams come true at the same time.....

    "\nWhile the Brooklyn Bridge is the oldest of the bridges crossing the East River, it\u0027s one of the strongest, sturdiest and will most likely outlast the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges. John Roebling and his son, Washington, did not know how the forces of nature and bridge loads would affect their bridge. Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure. \n\nBut the Roeblings\u0027 gaps in knowledge also worked against them. One of the most interesting portions of the book is where McCullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the East River where Washington Roebling and many his workers spent their time. Few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body. The quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many, including Washington, with a condition known as the bends. Washington\u0027s wife, Emily, was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while Washington struggled with the bends.\n\nThere are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction.   McCullough\u0027s book is much more about the politics and people behind Brooklyn Bridge rather than the engineering. I would have preferred to read more about the engineering techniques, but I  still found this book reasonably engaging.\n",

    "\nI have bought many books in my life, but Randy Gage\u0027s \"Why You\u0027re Dumb, Sick and Broke\" is the first time I ever bought a book with a parental advisory warning for explicit language. Gage does things a little differently than anyone else, which is something I quickly discovered when reading this book. This book is brash, to the point and filled with insight and inspiration. I thought that Gage presented his points in a well thought out manner that really took the establishment on head on.\n\nMany points presented in the book are in other personal development books. However, I don\u0027t know of any book that has all these points in one book. Even Gage himself admits in an interview that this is a combination of Think and Grow Rich, The Secret, Ayn Rand and several other books and cd\u0027s.\n\nA lot of it you have heard before, like if you say you are broke, then you will always be broke. However, I didn\u0027t realize how much the mainstream media and the political establishment are contributing to our negative, broke thoughts. Most frightening of all, I learned why the establishment needs us to be broke in order to keep their power. I am taking Randy\u0027s lead and watching less TV, especially the news. That\u0027s the worst of all!\n\nThere is also a nice introduction to Libertarianism and the works of Ayn Rand. As a Libertarian myself, I was delighted to see this included in the book. With recent reports circulating about Britain on the verge of becoming a police state, this warning about big government couldn\u0027t have come at a more appropriate time.\n\nAs expected, Randy does make a plug for MLM, but this is by no means an MLM book. The MLM plug is just a few short pages. However, it is still a nice resource for MLM people to use for third party credibility. He also mentioned real estate and information marketing as good businesses as well. I must be smart, healthy and rich, as I am already involved in all three.\n\nI found myself nodding in agreement to this book. I also found a lot of places where I was thinking, \"Oh, I\u0027m not the only one who this this way. Why hasn\u0027t this been mentioned before in the press?\" Other times, I thought, \"Oh my god, I am being really manipulated here.\" While he was \"preaching to the choir\" with me, I\u0027m sure that many people with more \"mainstream\" views will feel more challenged reading this book.\n\nBottom line, if you love MLM get 10 copies of this book, if you support the Libertarians, get 10 copies of this book. If you are like me and love them both, get 25 copies.\n\nAbout the author\nCarlos Scarpero is the host of the Network Marketing Minute podcast and the creator of the Success Duplicator downline building system.

    "\nTony Hillerman once again takes us into the world of the Navajo with Jim Chee and the legendary Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police. I read this for the first time some years ago, and this entry in the long-running series is very exciting. It has a lot of atmosphere and Leaphorn and Chee are fleshed out more than usual in this terrific read.\n\nBoth Chee and Leaphorn are dealing with personal issues as this one begins. Chee hasn\u0027t quite figured out how he feels about Mary leaving him because he could not leave his Navajo way of life behind and move to the city with her. He is smitten with a pretty Navajo attorney named Janet but she\u0027s with someone else. Leaphorn meanwhile, is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife Emma. Niether he or Chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named Eleanor Friedman-Bernal. No Navajo would be involved, as stealing pots like this would make one a \"Thief of Time\" according to Navajo tradition.\n\nChee\u0027s letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to Leaphorn\u0027s investigation, and once more Chee will be helping Leaphorn all across the Navajo territory. This one will stretch all the way into Utah and down the San Juan River. Leaphorn will be reminded of a young boy\u0027s death by drowning before this one wraps up, and it will have unexpected ties to his search for Eleanor.\n\nIt seems Eleanor was looking for pots made by the Anasazi, a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth. Pictographs and petroglyphs of Kokopelli, the \"Watersprinkler,\" will play a vital part in this mystery. But Eleanor\u0027s interest is also anthropological, and someone thinks what she\u0027s discovered is worth killing for.\n\nLeaphorn and Chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery. One will have to race to the other as things turn ugly, and two very different men will find commom ground when Leaphorn asks the unexpected of young Chee.\n\nHillerman\u0027s descriptions of the thousand foot cliffs along the San Juan River at night, under a sky filled with Navajo mystery, will enthrall you. This is a good mystery and quite possibly the best in the series. You don\u0027t want to miss this one\n",

    "\nReading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking, which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. The first time that I read it, I read it as a novel, for entertainment. Years later, I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.  During this second reading, I was able to examine the Russian names, characters, events, and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog, which I scanted then but studied now. Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going, which it certainly is, but in it, Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do. In essence, each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space, with one atom colliding at random with another, but when a sufficient number act in concert, such as Napoleon\u0027s invasion of Russia, their force is irresistable. When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar, he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom, who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can.  The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change.  But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms, then they are drawing closer to a universal \"one\" with nature.  This \"one\" Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God. Tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that \"one\" or any other deity, but he does say that history, time, and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path, and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go, then he might wish to emulate General Kutuzov, who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going. \n",

    "\n(W is not really number one.)\n\nRitter\u0027s book is best summed up by Ritter in these 4 paragraphs from the Epilogue;\n\n\"The notion of the war in Iraq resulting from an intelligence failure is very convenient for all parties involved. The intelligence community can simply say that intelligence is a tricky business, and sometimes you get it wrong. This, of course, provides a convenient excuse for the politicians, and compliant media, to contend that they were simply acting in the public interest based upon the information they were given...\n\n...In the end, to accept the concept of Iraq as an intelligence failure, one must first accept the premise that the USA was implementing, as its primary objective for Iraq, the Security Council\u0027s resolutions on disarmament. This argument is simpy not sustainable. The behavior of the United States government and its intelligence agencies during my time as an inspector was not that of a government that was serious about disarmament. Support for UNSCOM\u0027s mission was, at best, tailored to the political imperatives at any given time. There was a total willingness to compromise the integrity of UNSCOM (and with it the whole notion of multilateral disarmament) for short-term tactical advantages in the battle between the US and Iraqi regimes. Towards the end of the inspections era, elements of the US government actively sought to make UNSCOM\u0027s job more difficult by cutting it off from intelligence sources. Disarmament was simply not the USA\u0027s principal policy objective in Iraq after 1991. Regime change was.\n\nThe CIA was designated as the principal implementer of this policy. Therefore, when one looks at the March, 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent removal of power of the government of Saddam Hussein, the only conclusion that can be reached is that the CIA accomplished its mission. Iraq was, in fact, a great intelligence victory, insofar as the CIA, through its manipulation of the work of the UN weapons inspectors and the distortion of fact about Iraq\u0027s WMD programs, maintained the public perception of an armed and defiant Iraq in the face of plausible and plentiful evidence to the contrary. We now know that both the US and UK intelligence services had, by July 2002, agreed to \u0027fix the intelligence around policy\u0027. But the fact remains that, at least as far as the CIA is concerned, the issue of \u0027fixing intelligence around policy\u0027 predates July 2002, reaching as far back as 1992 when the decision was made to doctor the intelligence about Iraqi SCUD missile accounting, asserting the existence of missiles in the face of UNSCOM inspection results which demonstrated that there were none.\n\nAs an American, I find it very disturbing that the intelligence services of my country would resort to lies and deceit when addressing an issue of such fundamental importance to the security of the USA. Intelligence, to me, has always been about the facts. When intelligence is skewed to fit policy, then the entire system of trust that is fundamental in a free and democratic society is put at risk. Iraq, and the role of the CIA in selling the war with Iraq, is a manifestation of such a breach of trust.\"\n\nWe\u0027ve been had. On the Grand Scale. The problem of \"politicization of intelligence\" is clearly a bi-partisan issue.\n\nI\u0027m recommending this book for anyone who seeks the truth about Iraq\u0027s WMD\u0027s. I\u0027m giving this book 5/5 stars just for delivering up the truth, damn the consequences\n",
    "\nIt\u0027s been awhile since I had a really good crime mystery read.  Therefore, I was excited when The Cold Moon by Jeffery Deaver arrived at the library.  The latest Lincoln Rhyme novel delivered just what I was looking for...  twists, turns, and plenty of forensic work.\n\nThe plotline here starts out on two tracks.  A killer nicknamed The Watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques.  His signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene. Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, his partner, are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die.  Sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder.  The murder points to a run-down bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis.  There\u0027s a strong chance that the cops are corrupt, so Sachs has to step carefully as it\u0027s not clear who she can trust.  The two cases converge when The Watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that Sachs is investigating.  But the layering of deception goes even deeper than that, and Rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind The Watchmaker...\n\nIf you want plot twists and turns, this book will definitely satisfy.  There are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion, only to be something else entirely.  The layering of plots by the killer never seems to end, and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction.  A couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top, but not so much as to put me off the story.  It\u0027s a book I really didn\u0027t want to put down, even though I had other things I should be doing..\n",
    "\nThis was the first book by Johnson I read, though my mentors and teachers spoke of him often. The information about the mandorla was particularly helpful, giving a visual and archetypical model for holding the energy of the apparently opposite forces in a space of new possibility. \n\nJohnson writes that if I can be with the opposites, at the point of their intersection and stay with my conflicting thoughts and impulses long enough, the two will teach each other something and produce an insight that serves both... produce something utterly new instead of win, lose or compromise.  \n\nThe key appears to be that every real solution has to grow from the unique situation I face. Formulas, how-to\u0027s, devices and processes can never be enough in such moments. Referring to my own past for an experiential reference or to another\u0027s experience or advice can\u0027t do it, either, because it prevents or sidetracks the point of unlimited potential that wants to appear in and emerge out of each unique encounter.\n\nI liked what Maria had to say in her post: \"Meet your shadow\", dated November 22, 2003. She said she gave it only 4 stars because he doesn\u0027t tell how to DO that is described as possible in the book... I felt a little of that, too. And I have since appreciated the blessing of not being told how until I\u0027ve done a bit of my own struggle with my own opposites in many life situations. \n\nA book I found to be a perfect companion to this one is \"I of the Storm - Embracing Conflict, Creating Peace\", by Gary Simmons. I highly recommend it in addition to this book. It addresses some of the questions I felt about the nature of conflict after finishing Owning Your Own Shadow, in a way that shed light into my life. I am very appreciative of both books. \n\n",
    "\nLiz Perle does a really nice job in \"Money, A Memoir\" of weaving statistics, professional studies, and other people\u0027s experiences with her own personal experience and insight.  While many parts of her book sound familiar (e.g., women shopping when they\u0027re in a slump) it does look below the surface at some of the root causes of our unhealthy relationship with money and why we differ vastly from men in that regard.  The other thing I appreciated about the book was that Perle doesn\u0027t claim to have all the answers, and explains how she was able to find a happy medium in her relationship with money, which to me sounded like something I could attempt and achieve.  Thanks, Liz for a very important memoir that women of all ages should read\n",

    "\nMichael Haller\u0027s life revolves around criminal defense, his an attorney operating out the back of his Lincoln town car. His appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy, people either called him Mick or Mickey. Tall, dark and Intelligent with his good looks and Irish blood lines made him a catch. In the court room he was very together with great timing, in his personal life it was a mess, at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter. His father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney; another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to, his father wrote books and practised law that didn\u0027t have room for innocent clients, so far Mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just wouldn\u0027t recognize innocence if it came along. Being an Independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll, he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who couldn\u0027t afford to pay his fees. In total he kept four Lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour, what he was really looking for was a franchise player, a case to keep the cash rolling, point blank a meal ticket. \n\nLouis Ross Roulet dealt in LA property he was a rich playboy, currently booked on charges of ag-assault, GBI, and attempted rape, and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court. Mickey couldn\u0027t believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook. This was all too easy, in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case. Just as he was on a roll Mickey\u0027s close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just didn\u0027t sit right, in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil. \n\nThis is the first time in a long time that I have picked up a book based on a court room drama; but this book is much more than just that. Michael Connelly has done a wonderful job; his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through; well written and easy to follow so you don\u0027t get lost in the jargon of law, especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the US law system. I\u0027m hoping very much that Mr. Connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer Mickey Haller in other books going forward, Congratulations to Michael Connelly for a rollercoaster read. \n\nA.Bowhil\n",

    "\nMcNeill calls American Indians and Africans little more than the victims of the West in this book. He explains that they have little role in the development of culture (which he sees as passing from society to society from Mesopotamia on, like some sort of conceptual Olympic torch) and some get it and others do not. It is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history, and difficult to read without cringing. \n\nThat said, the book contains marvelous elements. Few writers will explain with his brevity and mastery how cultures have passed elements, one to another, over the expanse of time; few writers can convey the forward momentum of history as McNeil. So with all its faults, it is very worthy book, certainly worth reading while keeping in minds its somewhat dramatic shortcomings\n",
    "\n     Red Lily is clearly the best book in the series.  While reading this one I could visualize the scenes.  This book would make a good movie, but I can\u0027t decide under what category it would fit into.  Although it\u0027s clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller.  With all the talk of a ghost (as the rest of the series) this book it isn\u0027t a believable read as much as a fun read.     \n",
    "\nFor those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one, you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages.  Statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through.  The writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of China and its muscle power.  Instead of branding China as a villain, we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains, China wouldn\u0027t be where it is now.  Wal-Mart is covered in detail.  The writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing, it\u0027s only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when China has perfected its manufacturing bases just as Japan and South Korea had done before it.  Then, there\u0027s another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located, and how China is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour.  China\u0027s progress isn\u0027t simply detrimental to other countries.  On contrary, it benefits them as well.  For example, Australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to China.  With increase of living standard in China, Chinese needs more nutritious food.  As China couldn\u0027t provide enough, United States particularly the Middle States are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the Middle Kingdom.  Then, there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping United States in check by siding with China, and also the love and hate relationship between USA and China of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in China and so forth.  Whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided (since China has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time), suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks.  Yes, some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately, I think they are missing the points.  What\u0027s crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about China and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come.  Highly recommended\n",

    "\nReviewed by Bette Daoust, Ph.D. for Reader Views (6/06)\n\nI find it interesting that I am reviewing a book I had read five years ago when it first came out. All this really means is that this book has definite longevity (and believe it or not, all of the \"predictions\" in the book are a reality today. Seth Godin set forth to spread his book like a virus to everyone he could through his connections, and their connections, and their connections and \"so on and so on\". The truth is the idea virus is real and his book is living proof that ideas and other products can certainly be spread by word-of-(mouth, email, infrared, download, or whatever).\n\nI have always been an admirer of Seth Godin and although I have not read all of his books, I will make certain that I do. He has a keen sense of marketing like no other as in his \"Purple Cow\" as well as this book \"Unleashing the Idea Virus\". Who better to write about spreading ideas around than Seth. His book has certainly hit the circuit and still has a long way to go before absolutely everyone who should read this book (and apply the information). This book is a must for anyone that touches the marketing function in their business.\n\nThe Idea Virus is a book full of common sense items but with a twist that makes them more realistic than just theory. The real life situations described bring all the points to home. I just hope that the next time I sneeze, a new idea, the targeted hive picks it up and swarms around it and passes it on. I want to own the market in my defined hive and I want it to propagate and live on for a long time. This book is one terrific example! Go download it or purchase it at the bookstore.\n\n",
    "\nEvery now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator.   The mid-first century of Rome was such a time and Tacitus was such a communicator.  The Histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history.   The historian will do well to read Tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity.   While observing and commenting on the human element in history, Tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil, wars, and rumors of wars.  His beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity.  His example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow.\n\nA word on this translation in particular - I found Mr. Wellesley\u0027s translation very readable and poetic.  He seems to have captured the literature value of the text as well as the content.  Well done\n",
    "\nPhilbrick does an outstanding job of weaving an enthralling story from historical references.

    "\nFirst, the strengths: Andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists, with chapters on Munsterberg, Arnheim, Eisenstein, Balazs, Kracauer, Bazin, Mitry, Metz, and Ayfre, and Agel. He focuses on the debate between the formalists (who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing, framing, mise-en-scene, lighting, and etc.) and the realist tradition (who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography, a physical impression of its subject). The highlight is undoubtedly Andrew\u0027s excellent discussion of the great French critic Andre Bazin, which is not surprising since Andrew\u0027s Ph.D thesis was on Bazin. The weaknesses: This was published in 1976, and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then, especially feminism, and the influence of Lacan and psychoanalytic theory. Still, this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory\n",

    "\nDefinitely one of the best books I have read. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a complex mixture of simple things. The simplicity of the language, style, ideas, characters and concepts is unique to this book. The expression of complicated life matters and situations in such a simple manner makes this book a definite must-have.\nIn the book, Mark Haddon borrows the voice of his lead character Christopher, an autistic child, to tell the story. Christopher is an autistic and smart 15 year old boy. He\u0027s a math whiz with an unsatisfiable appetite to solve problems. His approach to all life issues is to convert them into a math problem of some sort and find out ways to deal with these issues.\nThe story mainly revolves around Christopher\u0027s investigation to find out who killed his neighbour\u0027s dog Wellington. Despite his father\u0027s instructions to not pursue the issue, Christopher goes on to attempt to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington.\nThe story unravels before Christopher and he is hit with a reality far more complex than his own understanding of life. His investigations result in only unearthing long buried secrets of his mother who, he knows, died three years earlier.\nChristopher\u0027s determination to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington and the mystery of his mother\u0027s death is something to be revered throughout the development of the story. The child\u0027s emotional roller coaster ride is witnessed first hand on every page. The reader experiences Christopher\u0027s feelings and emotions so transparently that it makes it extremely difficult not to feel attached to the story.\nThe story in itself is funny at times, sad and miserable at others; complex in one place and extremely simple in another.\nThis is a novel that you can be certain will change the way you perceive the things in your life once you are through. Your world will never be the same again. In a good way\n",

Plus he give approximate mixing times, which was a blessing for me since I had never made cream puff dough before.  The Cordon Blue version had no mixing times and with such a small amount of cheese compared to the Artisanal version I cannot believe that it would be anywhere near as good.

The plot involves a search for the true roots of an orphan (Emma) and introduces the readers as well as her main characters to London\u0027s back streets. Of course there are all the undying and unfulfilled loves as well as the unlikely coincidences that make for a great period novel\n",
    "\nYou want to read a horror story? This is it. This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all.\n\nEVERYONE ignored it. The CDC, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors, and they were ignored too. Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a \"gay disease.\" Gay men didn\u0027t want to discuss that it \"might\" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable. Blood banks wouldn\u0027t even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated, even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening.\n\nBy the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS, over 25,000 Americans were dead from the disease.\n\nThis book made me cry. The entire way through it, I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw things, I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too. A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark, \"Well, at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people.\" How absolutely disgusting. \n\nThis is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading, all of it frustrating, angering, scream-inducing, and yet, still inspiring. They didn\u0027t give up. No one threw in the towel until their last breath, or until funding, sufficient funding, was finally granted. Sadly, the author himself died of AIDS in 1994. God bless everyone who worked so hard to make AIDS a household word, which finally happened, oh, about SEVEN STINKING YEARS after it first started killing people in the US. What the heck is wrong with this country? Why did people have their heads in the sand for so long? What\u0027s so stinking WRONG with us?\n\nAnother book everyone should read, if only to know how our government helped spread AIDS around the world by ignoring it for six damn years. How many people did they kill by doing that? Far, far too many. We were the last civilized nation to institute an AIDS education/prevention program. This book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more, and I didn\u0027t think that was possible.\n\nGod bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with AIDS\n",

King\u0027s second book, and perhaps it should have been his first. I\u0027ve been in China since 1999. If I ever want to visit a town in the US, I don\u0027t need a plane ticket. I can just real SALEM\u0027S LOT. Consider it a clinic on world building. These are the places and the people I left behind, right there, recorded by a master. Well, except for the vampire. I don\u0027t recall seeing him in Watha. Maybe he moved into my old house. \n\nActually, that\u0027s Stephen King right there. He creates an entirely real world, then throws in something unusual because it makes the story move and because he just thinks it\u0027s cool. A vampire here, a rabid dog there, a mind reader over there, a UFO crashing into Hickville... \n\nNobody has defended Stephen King by mentioning that William Shakespeare trucked heavily with ghosts and witches and prophesies in his stories, so I\u0027ll limit myself to a single sentence. \n\nI believe that, just as I studied Mary Shelley\u0027s FRANKENSTEIN in a Literature class, one day students will study Stephen King. Just nothing about cars that come to life, because those stories really suck. I will accuse Stephen King of being uneven, and he explains why in ON WRITING. But at his best, I recommend him highly. \n\nOh, and here\u0027s a weird bit of trivia. I recognized the scene on page 50. Nothing before it, nothing after it, just that one bit. So I at least began reading this book. Probably at a guard desk. Tampa, Florida, has excellent libraries. At my guard desk, when I wasn\u0027t writing, I was getting drunk on literature, and I can\u0027t possibly remember it all. But I think SALEM\u0027S LOT by Stephen King plus THE THANATOS SYNDROME by Walker Percy spurred me to write THE DEMONS WITHIN, which I later threw out but which gave DESCENT INTO MADNESS its back story. \n\n(For Madman trivia buffs: Terrence and Sandra Howell once had their own novel. It really sucked. Terrence had his own novel 15 years before that. It also sucked. He\u0027s a composite of two classmates, Terrence Cram and Ricky Howell, so I\u0027m glad he finally showed up in some form.) \n\nIn ON WRITING, Stephen King tells us that he was so drunk and stoned at one point that he can\u0027t remember writing some of his books. It seems I was so high on literature at one point that I forgot entire books I read, including SALEM\u0027S LOT. So, I guess that getting old does have its advantages. \n",

    "\n\n\tWere someone to write a biography of Carl Hiassin in fifty years it is hard to imagine that he or she wouldn\u0027t focus on the author\u0027s latest triumph, Skinny Dip. It is one of his seminal achievements. The book simply shines with humor, well drawn characters, action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts. It is also one of his smoothest rides. One gets the feeling that Hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote.\n\tHere is an overview that will stimulate readers\u0027 interest Hiassin\u0027s. The book opens with Chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship, but by some twists and turns and luck Joey survives long enough to be rescued. Much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as Joey and her team pursue vengeance. By the midpoint of the novel Chaz is already an emotional wreck and it doesn\u0027t look like Joey is about to let up any time soon. \n\tThe moral backbone of the novel is twofold. One is the pitting of the Everglades Forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants. The Everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many Floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed, which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business. Hiassin\u0027s two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book, but also lends it a feeling of seriousness.\n\tAnd two is the pitting of criminals against victims who aren\u0027t going to take it anymore.  Hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to Joey. As most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to one\u0027s helplessness. \n\tThere are six main characters in the book: Joey and her horny husband Chaz, Joey\u0027s rescuer Mick who is a kind and eccentric ex-policeman who lives alone on an island, Joey\u0027s brother, a rich expatriate who raises sheep in New Zealand, Mr. Hammernut, the owner of a large agricultural empire and Tool, the books muscled goon who undergoes a moral transformation. The small group of sub-characters is entertainingly populated in part with a hermit who lives in the swamp, a street-tough hairdresser, a slap-happy senior and a cowardly lawyer.  \n\tThough similar elements live in many of Hiassin\u0027s works his books never feel like he has used a formula to create them more easily. This can\u0027t be said for all or most of crime writers and should be accredited to Hiassin\u0027s love for storytelling, his skill as a plot weaver and his ability to evoke so many different emotions. In this line of thought this reviewer took note of the characters subtle (except for Tool) character changes throughout the book. Joey for example seemed learn a bit more restraint as she calmed down a little and the same can be said even for characters that have appeared in some of Hiassin\u0027s previous works (Mick).\n\tHiassin has never been a fan of superficial materialism, but the issue is slightly complicated by Skinny Dip and does not simply fall into place along character axes. While the villains all crave money some of the heroes are loaded too. Joey maintains a very frugal existence considering her $ 13 million trust, but her brother spends lavishly. Joey\u0027s rescuer on the other hand lives on a disability check. One may wonder if the only difference between Chaz and his wife is that she never had to work or hustle for a buck, but there is one other way in which the enemies contrast and that is the way they treat their associates. Chaz is continuously scrambling for something and in his desperation - be it for sex, money, or escape - uses other people as tools rather than relating to them as equals. On the other hand, Joey has a good sense of humor and she enjoys the companionship of her pals.\n\tLike most of Hiassin\u0027s work this book is not an overly violent one. Although it begins with an attempted murder, the event is quite peaceful. There is no struggle, no blood and the victim, Joey, does not die. \n\tAfter reading Skinny Dip I immediately lent it to my best friend Katie who has not been able to put it down. So, potential readers be warned: Like Katie you may not be able to get any work done for a day or two, but the time is not wasted on Hiassin\u0027s best work to date. One comes away gaining not only pleasant memories of laughs and smiles, but also the feeling that one has poured one more drop into the bucket of our minds that we must fill in order to make this world a better place. In short, Carl Hiassin puts us in touch with the good guys in ourselves\n",
    "\nI bought this reluctantly because it was decided upon by a discussion group I was partipating in, but I ended up being very glad to have read this wonderful piece of contemporary literature. Mary Lawson weaves an incredibly sad but totally compelling tale of life in a small community in Canada. Others here have given insight into the plot and characters, so I\u0027ll keep this short by saying that you won\u0027t be disappointed and that I eagerly look forward to reading more from this author, she seems to have exceptional talent\n",
    "\nAs one of America\u0027s greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and, like Abraham Lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations.  This book and his earlier autobiography, Where\u0027s the Rest of Me, will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions.  This work, An American Life, however, will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life, during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor.  For anyone who had the pleasure of listening to Reagan\u0027s political commentaries on the radio, or hearing him speak as Governor of California or as President of the United States, the book will be particularly enjoyable; for it is written in the easy-going conversational style that Reagan used in life.  What makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which Ronald Reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today.  You may also observe that the problems of Reagan\u0027s day are not much different than those we face today.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand Ronald Reagan, how his many faceted character was formed, the inner workings of his mind, and the actions which led to his monumental achievements.  In my view, it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every American child. \n",

    "\nI love historical fiction, and The March was one of the better historical novels that I\u0027ve read. The characters are well-drawn, and the action moves along briskly, with no dead spots.  The civil war background seemed very authentic, and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions, The March blends the two to show that war really is hell.\n\nDoctorow is an excellent writer, and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable.  My only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that Union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue.  That\u0027s not true, as studies of Union soldiers\u0027 letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members, or for other reasons than just slavery.  That also applies to Confederate soldiers.  A minor quibble that doesn\u0027t really hurt the book, but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real, documented historical fact.\n\nHighly recommended\n",

Her boyfriend/professor is a good friend of someone in the FBI and the file gets distributed.

You\u0027ll be constantly turning the page to see how Darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold. \n\nThe only problems with the book are as follows: \n\n1 - The book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times\n\n2 - The book is all action and adventure and little else. Once it\u0027s done you\u0027ll never go back and read it again. This would make a very poor book club book.\n\n3 - A little over the top on the implied sex etc between Darby and her professor etc...

    "\nFor those of you who might find the first Found book or this second one offensive in its content -- guess what? -- life is offensive. And for that matter, life is also often tragic, poignant, ironic, hysterically funny, random, and sometimes all of these things at once... the \"Found\" books and the magazines reflect all of these aspects of everyday life. That\u0027s what makes it so remarkable. Indeed, how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages? This work by Davy Rothbart, co-editor Jason Bitner, and all the Found crew deserves praise because this is a cross-section of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials. If, several thousand years from now, (android? zombie?) archeologists study our current century, they might go through our trash. Think of \"Found\" as giving them a headstart.\n",

    "\nJohn Lynch wrote a classic in Spanish-American Revolutions 1808-1826. He masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of Latin America from Spain. The book starts in Rio de La Plata and ends in Mexico and Central America. Curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by Spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the Creole ruling class. The reluctance of Spanish Monarchy (and later even of liberals) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the Creoles (Spanish born in America). For all of those who are interested in a better understanding of Latin American societies of today this great book is a must. Lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the Hispanic American societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis.  Two thumbs up\n",

    "\nI recommend that most people do NOT read this book.  If you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway, please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so (and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on Amazon): **magical realism**; Jewish history, religion, culture and humor(although the last is perhaps redundant); memory; folk lore; the English language; love; the nature of histories; sex; death; pain; narrative style and voice; the multiplicity of human, and likewise Jewish, experience; imagination.  I will assert, because I hope it is true, that you don\u0027t need to all of these things to enjoy \"Illuminated,\" but you do need to be familiar with some of it.  And you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it.  All those with self-diagnosed A.D.D. need not bother cracking the spine. However, even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you, everything may be indeed sadly \"obfuscated.\"  Or perhaps less disappointingly, only partly obfuscated.  If so, don\u0027t get angry. Don\u0027t curse the gods or creative writing programs. And certainly, if you are going to write bad reviews on Amazon, preface it first with your own faults as a reader. Lastly, buck up.  Read another book.  Even the Bible (another little book high up on the best seller\u0027s list) is not for everyone.\n\nAnd for those of you out there who disagree to my approach with this review of \"Illuminated\", that is fine.

    "\nIt\u0027s been several years since I read the book.  Saw it recently, the book seems to be a favorite, of the coffee-house, talky, chattering, left, Marx-Freud-Rousseau crowd.    \n\nHowever, all this at talk of a \"just society\" and the \"underprivileged\" can and does mean only one thing:  A POLICE STATE.   \n\nAnytime, a so-called \"theory\" attempts to create a utopian state, there will be coercion.

    "\nWhat lessons, if any, do past social movements teach American citizens?  Is change feasible in today\u0027s society?  Howard Zinn attempts to answer these two questions, along with a number of others, in his book entitled \u0027You Can\u0027t Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times.\u0027  A beautifully written and inspirational book, \u0027You Can\u0027t Be Neutral on a Moving Train\u0027 is quintessential Zinn-direct, yet optimistic.  Zinn\u0027s central argument is that we are all capable of participating in change, however, for change to occur, we must all experience a social and political reawakening.  Zinn\u0027s book offers the reader a more hopeful version of politics and society.  Yet, such a version is only feasible if we, as Americans, actively participate in the political process.  This involvement will fill ones soul with a sense of meaning, and in the end will create a better world for all to live in.  For those interested in the history of American society, politics, and social justice issues, \u0027You Can\u0027t Be Neutral on a Moving Train\u0027 is a marvelous book filled with inspiration\n",

I also love pop-ups, so I was really excited to learn about this book. And I must say, my expectations have been surpassed.\n\nThe story line is very simple: a young child looks for his Mommy, encountering various monsters along the way and defeating them in creative ways. There are only a few written words in the book. But the story that the pictures tell is wonderful. What child wouldn\u0027t be delighted by a book in which a kid defeats the wolfman by pantsing him? Nosferatu gets a binky! And there\u0027s a ton of detail in the pictures as well. My girls like to spend several minutes looking at each page spread.\n\nThen there are the pop-ups. This book is really a paper engineering marvel. The pop-up bits are enormously detailed and full of movement. My favorite part is when the boy unwraps the mummy. It\u0027s an understatement to say the pop-ups are spectacular.\n\nThe only reservation at all I have about this book is that my kids will probably love it to death. Like another reviewer, I think I\u0027m going to buy them their own copy and keep one for myself!\n\nIf you have the least interest in Sendak or pop-ups, or think you might, buy this book\n",
    "\nFirst, a few words about each of the four different stories.\n\n\n\"The Man in the Black Suit\" - 3 stars\n\nThis is a story about a 9-year-old boy who meets the Devil himself. It\u0027s a very scary experience for the boy, especially because his older brother died the year before and now the Devil tells him that his mother has just died in the same way.\n\nThis is the weakest of the four stories because the Devil, although being scary, doesn\u0027t really come across as a serious threat. What kind of second-rate Devil is it that can\u0027t even catch a boy who decides to run away from him?\n\nIn \"Everything\u0027s Eventual\" Stephen King writes that this story won a prestigious \"best short story\" award in 1996, much to his surprise. That surprises me too, because in my opinion this story is not that great.\n\n\n\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\" - 5 stars\n\nThis is the shortest story (only 35 minutes) and one of the two best ones in this collection. Alfie Zimmer is a traveling salesman in the American Midwest. He has an amazing hobby and he\u0027s tired of life. But if he commits suicide, what will everyone think of his hobby?\n\nWhat makes this story so good are the very detailed and evocative descriptions of the conditions under which a traveling salesman lives. Alfie\u0027s strange hobby is also captivating, as are the descriptions of the landscape and isolated towns in the bleak and barren Midwest.\n\nIn \"Everything\u0027s Eventual\" Stephen King admits that Alfie\u0027s strange hobby was actually something he did himself!\n\n\n\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\" - 4 stars\n\nThis is a very unusual story for Stephen King. It tells a \"mythical\" story about the 1934 death of Jack Hamilton, member of the John Dillinger gang. Homer Van Meter, another gang member, purportedly tells the story.\n\nJohn Dillinger, Jack Hamilton and Homer Van Meter were all real people. You can find a lot of interesting background information about them by doing an Internet search for John Dillinger.\n\nDespite the fact that these were all ruthless gangsters we find ourselves sympathizing with them. Stephen King\u0027s approach to the story is that gangsters are also human beings. The slow death of Jack Hamilton and the efforts of John Dillinger to get him medical help and Dillinger\u0027s distress as Jack Hamilton\u0027s condition worsens are powerful images.\n\n\n\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French\" - 5 stars\n\nThis is the best story in the collection. Carol was brought up as a strict Catholic, but then, during the first years of her marriage to Bill, she had an abortion. Now she and Bill are supposed to be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary and Carol is being subjected to a horrendous punishment for what she did.\n\nWhat makes the story fascinating is that it is not God who is punishing Carol. No, it is Carol, under the influence of her Catholic upbringing, who has prescribed her own punishment. And this punishment Carol is inflicting on herself is much worse than a benevolent God would come up with, even assuming that God considers what Carol did to be wrong.\n\n\nIn summary, two very good stories, one good one, and one that\u0027s just OK.\n\nThe four stories are read by four different professional readers. The total running time is approx. 3 hours 40 minutes, not 4 hours as specified on the packaging.\n\nAll four of these stories are included in the book \"Everything\u0027s Eventual\", along with 10 other short stories by Stephen King. If you want to save money or if you dislike audio books then \"Everything\u0027s Eventual\" is a better deal.\n\nRennie Peterse\n",

After reading this book, you will know how to write in a way that comes naturally, write with nouns and pronouns (not superfluous adverbs and adjectives), write and then rewrite, but do not overwrite and overstate, use orthodox spelling, do not explain too much, avoid fancy words, be clear, do not inject opinions, use figures of speech sparingly, and countless other helpful techniques.  \n\nTo say that this book should be required reading for all writers is an understatement. This book should be required reading for anyone that writes\n",
    "\nI have read almost all of Greg Bear\u0027s books and loved EON and ETERNITY as well as THE FORGE OF GOD  and ANVIL OF STARS. I found LEGACY a little disappointing compared to EON and ETERNITY, which preceded them. The  narrative spends a lot of time on the human interactions of the characters,  and not much time on the technological concepts of the  flaw and gate  openers, which I missed. I did finish this book and at times was quite  spellbound by it. Not Mr. Bear\u0027s best work, but a must-read if you have  read EON and ETERNITY\n",
    "\nSomeday, I would love to travel to the places that Ann Rule writes about! As she is so discriptive, I usually feel like I have known these places, and the people she writes about, although...I have never been. These cases she presents in NO REGRETS, are as REAL to me, as if I\u0027d known them, and felt the sorrow of their loss! My personal favorite was A Very Bad Christmas..I usually like her Christmas ones, like Black Christmas in Vol.2!

I made the mistake of only checking the publishing date, decided it was a new novella published independently (as would be deserved, given the track record of the series), and ordered it without checking further. My bad.

    "\nI\u0027ve been staring at a copy of Thomas Friedman\u0027s \u0027From Beirut to Jerusalem\u0027 on my shelf for nearly a year now, meaning to read it but always drawn to something else.  Finally, recent events demanded that I learn more and I finally pulled it down, dusted it off, and read it.  I\u0027m so glad I did, especially now.\n\nThe book is not the easiest read, since it delves into a lot of regional history and politics, which gets complex no matter what you do.  Friedman\u0027s writing style, however, goes a long way towards making the text quite accessible for just about anyone, and his unique perspective on the events that he witnessed and covered in his role as a journalist keeps it interesting and always relevant.\n\nWhat I really appreciated about the way Friedman presents his story is that it really is HIS story.  He is obviously a man gifted with a keen sense of observation, and so he picks up on many details others might miss, such as the faces of Israeli soldiers or the opinions of Lebanese taxi drivers.  But still, the story is told mainly through events he observed directly -- he just happened to be there for many of the events that shaped the Middle East as it is today.  He tells it in both large and small terms, from some of the politicians he met and interviewed to discussions he had with neighbors and colleagues while living in the region.  The result is that you get the broad spectrum of what was going on in the region, particularly in the 1980\u0027s, a critical decade of events.\n\nI also appreciated Friedman\u0027s fairness throughout the book. From his perspective on the Lebanese government to the Palestinian intifada to the Israeli occupation to the American involvement in the region, he deals with all of the players fairly, whether big or small, famous or unknown.  That\u0027s not to say he doesn\u0027t have criticisms -- certainly, he has plenty to say about everyone...but one is never left with the feeling that he has been too harsh on one side and lenient on the other.  Friedman\u0027s willingness to observe with an unbiased eye and ear is key to the strength of this book.\n\nEven with the newer added chapters, dealing with the late 1980\u0027s and early 1990\u0027s, this book cannot be considered a \"complete\" history of the Middle East, or even of the events of the last 50 years.  However, it is not meant to be that, I think.  What Friedman has documented here is an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning more about how we got to where we are today in Lebanon and Israel and Palestine.  The book is not an end in itself, but for someone who wants to learn more about the region that is in the news almost every day, this is an excellent place to start.\n\nThe only way to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past is to learn from them. As such, \u0027From Beirut to Jerusalem\u0027 should be required reading today\n",

Wouldn\u0027t it be interesting for a man and his wife to go back in time to discover about when they might have had an ancestor in common? DNA testing and analysis had give you that and much more. It can even give you an idea what part of the world your pre-historical ancestors lived and migrated to. The authors practice what they preach and tell how we can do it too, with many DNA labs and companies listed and compared. We rated this book four hearts\n",
    "\n Dorothy Parker was a great writer and a great social observant who now gives us a clear window into the past. Her wit is biting and at it\u0027s best in this collection, favourite reads are for the individual to decide, however, for me, as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit. Parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance, as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time. Reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye, for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle\n",

    "\nThis book is like a long short story that centers around Danny and a period that he is at Yale.  He and his friends are preparing for a big party.  The book goes on to follow Danny as he tries to start a relationship with Polly (who is sometimes on sometimes off in her relationship with one of her professors) while remembering about a local girl back home named Cindy who he kind of left in the lurch after they finally went all the way.  \n\nJust before Danny is ready to go home for spring break and work on his father\u0027s mobile lunchmobile, Cindy arrives at the school with a big surprise.  This changes Danny\u0027s view on things and makes him numb to the point that he even doesn\u0027t care when some toughs try to hone in on his father\u0027s lunch route and threaten him.\n\nDanny goes back to school after the break and after resolving his issues with Cindy to attend the big bash that his friend Matt was planning at the beginning of the book.\n\nThis book like one of his later works, Little Children, shows Perrota\u0027s talent for creating intriguing characters in such short novels.  This book like the other seems to end too prematurely and definately screams out for a sequel!\n\nPerrota is a super talented writer and I would love to seem him develop a much larger complete novel than leave the audience hanging at the end of another short one\n",

    "\nThe author, James Surowiecki, lays out and explores a variety of general and specific cases of groups of people acting either wisely or stupidly.  The examples are all easy to relate to, and I found them to raise meaningful questions in my mind which were answered in due course in the text.\n \nWhen I think of crowds, I think of unthinking masses moving together, led by tradition, habit, or an individual.  How can that be wise?  A more accurate title would be \"How some groups of people can make better decisions than experts, while others act like collective idiots, and what characteristics distinguish the two types of groups\", although that\u0027s hardly likely to sell as many copies. :-)\n \nFor me this really shed some light on my past experiences of participating in successful and unsuccessful teams at work.  I\u0027d sometimes wondered why I\u0027ve been on a few teams that appeared to \"click\" (smart people who want to work together to achieve a common goal), but our results weren\u0027t great, whereas other teams have been successful.  What was it that made a good team?  I had some of the pieces, felt I still had some real gaps in my knowledge.  This book certainly helped.\n \nTo paraphrase the basic idea that I took away from the book, teams of people can achieve superior results if:\n1 Each individual on the team is well informed; \n2 The work of one individual does not influence the work of another; \n3 There is an objective method to aggregate individual conclusions into a group conclusion.\nAs simple as they sound, there are many ways to fail, and the book does a great job of exploring a variety of phenomena that cause failure.\n",

    "\nGood, high-level analysis of current US vs European international relations written from a conservative perspective.   As with any book covering fluid world events this book can only provide a snapshot, circa 2000-04, of those events.  But there are two significant underlying assumption in this book: \n\nFirst, as the single greatest world power, the US will project its power for decades in any region of the world it feels has long-term impact to its strategic goals, such as Europe throughout the entire Cold War, Southeast Asia in the 60\u0027s \u0026 70\u0027s and in the Middle East today.  \n\nSecond, US historically has viewed itself as the proponent of the spread of liberal democracy through out the world.  \n\nRather than focusing on the snipping back and forth between the US \u0026 Europe, the two major assumptions of this book could serve as a litmus test to observe how current US foreign policy in the Middle East plays itself out over the next few decades.  Is it merely a current political view or a historic shift in strategic focus to a different region of the world? Stay tuned.\n\nIt is a well-written, quick read with meaningful subcontextual insights.   \n",
    "\nIn some ways KM Soehnlein\u0027s THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS reminded me of the teenage novels of Paul Zindel.  There is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time.  Zindel wrote specifically for adolescents.  Soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post-pubescent boys and its social implications.  Although the book is written for adults, it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us.\n\nTHE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS is the story of a family that falls apart when a tragic accident befalls the youngest child.  The story is seen through the eyes of the victim\u0027s 13-year-old brother as he tries to find something to hold on to while his mother drifts into alcoholism, his father goes nuts, his sister becomes a religious fanatic (and a kleptomaniac) and he finds himself smitten with two boys.  One is Todd, the athletic and arrogant brother of his girl-pal confidante who lives next door.  The other is Scott, a boy who deals drugs, cuts school and has an alcoholic father who beats him.  All the characters are vividly rendered.  If this were ever turned into a film, the actress who plays the mother would probably win an Oscar just for her final scene in the car.\n\nThis is powerful and emotional writing.  I found it very moving.  It\u0027s tempting to want to recommend this book to a wide audience, but I am reticent because there are several scenes of furtive and unacknowledged sex between teenage boys that could upset some people.\n\nBut I will never forget this book.  Five stars\n",
    "\nThis is a book about beauty, passion, a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts, especially music, craves and feels, the fire that burns within. A book that dares to take one, if one dares to take that step, on a journey deep into the bare souls of it\u0027s characters. The story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot, or develops into dramatic changes for the characters. That is not what the author wanted to convey, and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity, and not expect the characters to travel actively without. The book gives us these people, the town, the surroundings. It brings us deep into the realities, the thoughts, the complexities of the human soul. The people are good, bad, ugly, beautiful, selfish, depressed, found, or lost. But from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in Mick Kelly\u0027s soul, and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town, then the author reveals her own soul with her words, for those that pick up on what her words show. I am still amazed at the power this book has. Any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book, should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous.\nFor me, this book will always be the book that made me capable of understanding how a writer weaves words together with her soul\n",
    "\nGODS AND GENERALS is an extremely well done and fascinating book.  The author, Jeff Shaara, did an excellent job of interpreting the characters. His task was a difficult one because his father\u0027s book, THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.  This book precedes the one written by his father. \n\nGODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles. The major players in the story are Winfield Scott, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.  The career biographies of these famous men were striking.  After reading of their early lives and service experiences, it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army. They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends.\n\nI listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.  He brought the characters to life by his narration. This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history.\n",

Different characters, same setting, and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil. LeHane\u0027s prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing, a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic , hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre. LeHane\u0027s descriptions jump right off the page at you. His characters are so human, so intense, their dialogue so sharp, that it\u0027s almost like watching a movie in your mind. There isn\u0027t a wasted word in this book. The suspense starts to build on page 1, and never lets up, becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter. This is a stay-up-late read to finish only when you\u0027re NOT alone in the night. \nLeHane\u0027s other works top my summer reading list.

    "\nGilbert Ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor. On page 16, he writes: \"A foreign stranger visiting the Oxford campus is shown libraries, department buildings, and museums. Then he asks \"But where is the University?\". This is the \"category mistake\". Cartesian question \"Where is the mind?\" has a same confusion, he asserts. \n\nA famous epigram \"Ghost in the Machine\" is sometimes misinterpreted. His point is that there is NO \"ghost\". What we think ghost (spirit) does not exist (therefore ghost!).\n\nAlthough the philosophy of ordinary language and the logical behaviorism, the British school represented by Wittgenstein and Ryle, had an its apogee in 50\u0027s, its crux of reasoning still has an important element. I still feel the current dominant school in cognitive science such as functionalism has a long way to go, before it can make it acceptable for broader spectrum of scientists whose prime mode of thinking is purely materialistic or physicalistic. \n",
    "\nThe Concept of Mind is a great book for several reasons. The main reason to me is that Ryle clarifies the concept of being human, while he uses language in a natural way. In stead of constructing concepts based on (for  example scientific) assumptions, he shows what we already see as obvious,  just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language. He is far  from reductionistic; mark the subtle irony: \u0027Man need not be degraded to a  machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine. He might, after all, be  a sort of animal, namely, a higher mammal. There has yet to be ventured the  hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man.\n",

    "\nHe is a nightwalker, a Navaho vampire who because he is only half Nosferatu has the strength not to succumb to the allure of the dark side of his nature.  He is a New Mexico state police officer who is often teamed up with beautiful FBI agent Diane Lopez who not only knows what Lee Nez is but accepts him for his good heart.  Right now they are trying to infiltrate a smuggling ring made up of skinwalkers (Navaho witches) who can shape shift at night and still retain their ability to think like a human.  \n\nThese smugglers known as the Silver Eagles go to Mexico in animal form, meet with their suppliers, and return with silver and turquoise for jewelry suppliers who get their products at black market prices.  The two cops seek to arrest humans who are part of the smuggling ring and kill the shapeshifters so they no longer can carry out their evil plans.  While Diane and Lee stalk the Silver Eagles, they are hunted by a vampire who wants to kill them because they murdered her nest including her husband and brother.

    "\n\"By a hypnotism that defies explanation--at least by a non-German--Hitler held the allegiance and trust of this remarkable people to the last.  It was inevitable that they would follow him blindly, like dumb cattle but also with a touching faith and even an enthusiasm that raised them above the animal herd, over the precipice to the destruction of the nation.\"\n\nThis remarkable book is based principally on the captured German documents, the interrogations and testimony at the Nuremberg trials of German military officers and civilian officials, the diaries and memoirs which some of them have left, and on Shirer\u0027s experience in the Third Reich.  Shirer became one of the most respected journalists in wartime Europe.\n\nThe book is exhaustive and detailed with extensive notes and bibliography.  A bit of patience is needed to get through the dialect, often quoting Mein Kampf.  Shirer brings forth wonderful descriptions of the people who played a role in those troubled times.  The individual battles are not detailed, so one will need to refer to other sources for a more detailed look at these battles and horrors that ensued.  This is an important book for those interested in Germany and life in the Third Reich at this time. \n\nThe Reich rises with a quick run through of Hitler\u0027s youth and the German history, then the politics and Hitler\u0027s megalomania that led to national socialism and the rise to dictatorship.  The Treaty of Versais and the fall of the mark lead to Germany\u0027s economic fall, allowing for the people to welcome in a dictatorship, a new messiah by deceit.  The military buildup could now begin.   The coups to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis had already failed and will continue to fail throughout the war.  For the officers it was either death by Hitler or death by fighting.  The massacres of the Russians began soon after the invasion of the East.  The French and other countries were also caught up in the massacre, and William gives us the eyewitness reports.  The \"Jewish cleansing\" started soon after the nazis took over their first countries. The Nazis kept developing more and more efficient means of extermination and experimentation.  There is an exhaustive lead up to the start of W.W.II, the invasion of Poland.  There was freighting information discovered on what would have been in store for Britain if invaded, not to mention the world and the slaughter of Russia.  The Nazi\u0027s pinnacle arrives at about 2/3 of the way through the book where the fall begins with the Allied advance.\n\nIt took military action eventually to stop Hitler\u0027s \"New world order\", not the people.  The lack of doing anything to stop Hitler from walking into the Rhineland should not be forgotten.  Does not the blame fall partly on the people, Chamberlain, and the military generals?  Maybe if more would have read Mein Kampf, and not disregarded it\u0027s contents millions would not have lost their lives.  The Nazi propaganda took over the press, and soon indoctrinated the German people.  There were many opportunities to stop Hitler by France and Britain early on.  Have we not learned anything from the past?  Is there not a parallel in our country?\n\n\"The Germans imposed the Nazi tyranny on themselves.\"\n\nHegel was one of the many influences on Hitler and Marx. Hegel and Marxism is still very much alive today in humanism, nationalism, \"supreme state\", racism,  and mysticism\n",
    "\nAfter reading a book of Sandra Brown\u0027s that I horribly disliked, I was hesitant to give her another shot. I\u0027m truly glad I did; The Witness was a first-rate thriller!\n\nThe villains in this book are greasy, sick individuals that rather turned my stomach...just what you like when you want to get a taste of Why A Person Would Run For Their Life! Sandra Brown wrote these characters (and that of Ricki Sue-who I could easily picture!) particularly well. The baby was truly the icing on the cake: this infant motivated Kendall throughout the book and, like any mother, lived for the love of her child.\n\nI also loved the sexy, romantic element here-it was just enough that it didn\u0027t overwhelm the story...even better, it didn\u0027t change Kendall into a mindless goober (a state which many female characters in \"romance\" novels often achieve.)\n\nThe Witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full five-star rating. Perhaps it was the Crooks...they came off a bit cliche, but were still necessary characters.\n\nStill, this book is an excellent, thought-provoking choice with a WOW ending. Very enjoyable\n",
    "\nSince reading this book in 1994, I have used it as a reference for my life AND work. Using a warm and witty style of writing, Allen teaches us the physiological and emotional benefits of mirth.  My favorite chapter title is \u0026quot;Strike While the Irony is Hot!\u0026quot;  So clever!! I recommend this book to friends who are facing life challenges and to everyone who attends my workshops.

    "\nWhile not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as Aquinas or Pannenberg (as another review here stresses), this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence.  This is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of Scriptural data concerning each topic, its apologetic engagement with differing views, and its practical counsel for life and ministry.  It is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions.  I recommend it highly\n",

    "\nBook number three in the Outlander trilogy, the fantasy historical romance of the time traveling Claire Fraser, has Claire re-unite with her 18th century husband, Jamie, who she left before the battle of Culloden in Dragonfly in Amber.  A time travel trip through the stones is once more necessary and Claire has to leave her beloved daughter Brianna behind. \n\nThis trip is successful and Claire is now plunged into the complicated life of Jamie, who has survived the battle but now is dealing with the post-uprising difficulties of the Scottish.  While Claire is involved with the difficulties of her re-union with Jamie, there is also a series of mysterious and violent murders in Edinborough, and the kidnapping of Jamie\u0027s nephew.  Claire and Jamie sail the high seas and encounter pirates, voodoo and slave uprisings in the Caribbean.\n\nThis colorful third installment in the series at times seems like it tries a little too hard to have Claire and Jamie caught up in every possible adventure of the time period.  Nevertheless the foundation of the solid characters created and nurtured by Gabaldan weather the slightly torrid escapades of this timeless romantic couple.  One of the new characters is a bit flimsy and caricatured; the giggling, bouncy, foot-worshipping Chinaman Mr. Willoughby.  Although he later proves to be more substantial than his intial portrayal, the appearance of this character is contrived and jarring.  A note I think the story would have been better without.   \n\nDespite its flaws, Voyager continues the thread of a passionate romance and fascinating premise.  The time travel fantasy is portrayed well--in particular the notion of what one would bring back to the 18th century if all you could carry was in your pockets.  Combining historical romance and fantasy was a genius stroke that makes this series of continuing interest.  Gabaldon\u0027s superior narrative, likeable characters and excellent research continue and keep her audience hooked.  In light of the inherent difficulty of maintaining reader interest in a character and premise over three books, this is a highly sucessful sequel. \n",

    "\nAngus Konstam\u0027s HISTORY OF PIRATES  uses works from the Mariners\u0027 Museum in Virginia to provide a powerful visual impact. Piracy from ancient to modern times is surveyed in a series of maps, images, and discussions that cover specific events, regions, and pirates. Plenty of historical and political background to the events place each in perspective and provide an excellent survey of mariner events of the times. There are other pirate histories on the market - but none with the commitment to visuals of HISTORY OF PIRATES.\n",
    "\nUntil very recently the subject of animal awareness has not even been approached with the correct questions. As Rogers clearly points out, most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon.  An inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors. \n\nIn the early 1600\u0027s Spinoza correctly determined the existence of an emotional balance. He told us that one extreme emotion will dominate the senses until such time that an equally extreme opposite emotion brings us back to emotional center. Antonio Damasio provides a compelling case that consciousness is inextricably linked to emotion in his book \"The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness\". Using Damasio and Spinoza as a frame of reference it follows that each and every decision we make is based on an emotion, not a uniquely quantifiable language infused thought, as the popular human interpretation might assume. Examples of this might be choosing the color of paint, a selection from a menu, the selection of a mate or which way to turn when unsure. Animals have provided us with an exhaustive and document able list of emotional behaviors. How is it possible to arrive at the conclusion that animals are not conscious when most animals will clearly display behaviors consistent with emotional stimulus? \n\nThe last frontier of computer science is the quest for a conscious, non-human entity.\nRay Kurzweil has spent the better part of his life predicting the emergence of an exponentially accelerating form of machine augmented human consciousness. In my view,  it would be safer to assume that at some point technology will provide us with means to understand the different levels of consciousness that exist. While computers struggle to redefine consciousness by passing \"Turing Tests\", visionary ethologists might find ways to interpret the world through different eyes. \n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to discuss the subject of animal consciousness from the point of view of the animal and avoid emotional interpretations. Lesley Rogers has given us a glimpse of this vast subject by asking the correct questions and, providing the current objective answers from each available vantage point. At a disciplined two hundred pages the book stands out as a concise introduction to the subject of Animal Cognition.\n",
    "\nI am a professional photographer, and I was looking for a book on lighting technique - which this book supplied excellently.\n\nTheir step by step approach is easy to follow and understand, and all explainations have images attached so you can see what they are talking about.\n\nThey slowly build your general knowledge on how light works rather than supplying specific lighting diagrams, allowing (and suggesting that you do) you to adapt the knowledge to your own use. They then go into more detail with difficult lighting subjects such as metal, glass, and more, and how to deal with them.\n\nMy only complaint is that the book is starting to feel a little old, especially when they talk about colour. It is almost exclusively film based with virtually no reference to digital technology. If they were to do an updated version with more emphasis on lighting for digital, I would provide 5 stars\n",

    "\nThe insights here are simple, straightforward and profound. It explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a no-win situation, resulting in a feeling of frustration, impotence, incompetence, and depression. The only socially acceptable way to express it is rage (even though rage is vilified, I can tell you that showing hurt, pain and weakness invites scorn, distain and disrespect, even from those who purport to love us). \nBy explaining how we get into this trap, it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out. I wish I could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world. I see so much of it played out every day all around us, and the pain both men and women feel because of it does so much damage. Read it before you have a crisis if you can, but if you are already in crisis, make the effort to read this book even if you can\u0027t read anything else. It might even save your life.

    "\nIt was a cold and snowy February day when a stranger walked to a small country inn and ordered a meal and a private room. This stranger guards his privacy and desires solitude. His luggage consists of many bottles of powders and fluids as would be used by an experimental investigator. The local general practitioner visits the stranger, and sees something he can\u0027t believe. Then someone steals money from the Reverend Bunting although he and his wife see nobody. Later Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Hall, innkeepers, see the stranger\u0027s room is empty, until the chair moves around as if possessed by spirits. When questioned by Mrs. Hall the stranger removes his nose! Then the bandages and spectacles go, and the people see no head! When the constable comes to arrest him, the man removes all his garments and disappears into thin air. The crowd tries to grab him but he escapes. \n\nMr. Thomas Marvel, a wandering tramp, is found by this Unseen and convinced to work for him. They return to the inn to fetch books and clothing. This sets off a commotion among the people there, and another chase. The panicked people fled from the streets and locked themselves in their homes. There was a story about \"flying money\" that was removed from shops and inns. At another inn Marvel seeks shelter, he has escaped from the Invisible Man. When this Unseen enters to take Marvel away, a bearded American fires at the Unseen with his revolver. Later the Unseen visits a physician for treatment of his wound (his blood can be seen). The Unseen has met Dr. Kemp at college, and is fed and clothed. \n\nThe Unseen explains the scientific principles of optical density in a general way. If the refractive index of a substance was lowered to that of air it would be invisible in most cases (Chapter XIX). The Unseen kept his work secret because of the thefts in the scientific world of science. But the Unseen acquired money by foul means which cursed his work! Griffin tells of the previous experiments that led to invisibility (Chapter XX). The next chapters gives Griffin\u0027s history. But Kemp has written to the police, and they arrive. Griffin escapes once again, and Kemp warns the police about what must be done (Chapter XXV). Griffin is mad and inhuman, \"pure selfishness\". His attempts to kill Kemp lead to his own destruction, and his body becomes visible after death (Chapter XXVIII). \n\nIf accurate, this story provides a snapshot of life in London and its suburbs at that time. It also tells that carrying arms was nothing unusual. H. G. Wells shows his literary skills in making believable an impossible condition. There are those who still believe that describing something in words makes it real (like \"childproof guns\", etc.). Readers of Wells\u0027 later works can judge how close to the truth his writings were. This fable warns against uncontrolled scientific experiments, from poison gas to atomic bombs, or the current craze for cloning or \"genetic modification\" The story of unseen theft of money can also be a warning against a Private Banking Cartel and its continual devaluation of the currency to help Big Business in its struggle against small businesses and working people. In this story the people unite to terminate the Unseen; this doesn\u0027t always happen in the real world. \n",

    "\nThe new economy is a global economy favoring intangible things: ideas, information, and relationships and is intensely interlinked.   Today, the new information based sector occupies over 15% of the total US economy.  In the postindustrial society, communication has become the economy and the cultural, technological, and conceptual impacts reverberate at the roots of our lives.   The financial sector has reshaped the economy; the financial sector ownership involves only a small number of people;  the financial innovations include: mortgages, insurance, venture funding, stocks, checks, credit cards, and mutual funds; the financial sector has given rise to corporations, market capitalism, the industrial age, and has influenced how all business has been done.  Since communication is the economy, the net is the future.  The net has accelerated in usage due to the increase in silicon chips and fiber optic data transmission; the net is weaving lives, minds, and artifacts into a global scale network; the result is the swarm of information, reticulating the surface of the planet; the new economy will increasing obey the logic of the networks and understanding the network will be the key to understanding how the economy works.  In 1997, there were 6 billion non-computer chips and by 2005 the predicted usage was at 10 billion.\n\nThe network represents connectivity.  We are connection everything to everything.  The network values the dumb power of bits in the swarm; the connectivity and usage of the dumb bits or parts in the swarm yield smart results; and we don\u0027t need advanced Artificial Intelligence to make an intelligent system.   The network is a link of distributed, bottom up, data bits;   it lets things communicate among themselves and takes a decentralized approach for communication, for example, manufacturing robots scheduling their own work based on incoming requests, as they bid on work dependant on their capability.  The swarm aim is superior performance in a turbulent environment.  Consider the power of the \"Wisdom of the crowds\".  In one case sample, 5,000 attendees, at a computer graphics conference were give individual access to a simulator and the task on how too land a plane.  The attendee had novice knowledge about how to land the plane.   The jet responded to the average decisions of the swarm.  The group landed the jet with almost no direction.   In another case example, the group was given the task to navigate a submarine and go look for buried treasure.   The group could not initiate any movement until leadership from a loud speaker was given to \"go right\".  The leadership unlocked the paralysis of the swarm and the direction facilitated action.\n\nTechnology success is measured on how invisible it becomes to the end user and how effective it becomes to the long term strategy in developing products and services that can\u0027t be ignored.   The power of the network increases in value n power 2 where n is the number of members.  Therefore, networks need to increase their critical mass of members to become effective.   Innovation attracts members.  Innovation is more important than price; price is the derivative of innovation; monopolies push up price and decrease quality and create a dangerous singular source of innovation; and the network destroys monopolies through collective innovation, such as, open source.\n",

    "\nThe late Ed McBain left all mystery buffs a lasting legacy with his 87th Precinct novels but a worthy addition to this legacy is The Gutter And The Grave. Written in 1958, this hardboiled gem has been all but forgotten. But thanks to Hard Case Crime, a new generation can experience this incredible early work from one of the all-time masters. \n\nThe hero, Cordell, is as tragic and harboiled as they come as he, soaked in cheap booze, wallows in the memory of an unfaithful wife. Until a favor for a friend draws him into a web of murder and deception. It seems everyone is lying and each lie twists the tail in new directions, leaving the reader\u0027s head spinning. The novel features McBain\u0027s usually excellent dialogue, the setting is well-drawn featuring the jazz scene in 1950\u0027s New York. There\u0027s humor, pathos, some great fights and enough broken dreams to fill Broadway. \n\nThis little gem of a novel has been unavailable for far too long. I give it my highest recommendation.

    "\nGreg Treverton has written a much needed overview of the national intelligence process and correctly identified the challenges which face the US, in a post-9/11 world.  His views of the world beyond 2010 are quite revealing and his challenges to the intelligence community to assess threats to the US are precisely focused. His views on the major intelligence entities reveal urgent modifications of structure and process, if the intelligence community is going to regain relevance with national customers.  As a teacher of intelligence process, specifically as it relates to strategic warning, I believe this book is essential reading for anyone who aspires to be a true intelligence professional. This book will help even the wisest analyst understand how to maximize available sources and methods.  The quest to provide the best possible intelligence is a goal which must be achieved.\n",
    "\nIs this a book of New Yorker cartoons or a puzzle book?  Well, it\u0027s a little of both, and the result is a novel way to laugh and exercise your brain at the same time. Most of the 83 puzzles consist of cartoons that are missing words, captions, or picture components. By figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics, crossword puzzles, or other word grids, the cartoon humor is revealed. \n\nFor the most part, the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty, although there are a few difficult ones (at least for me) that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonist\u0027s career. Frequent puzzle solvers will recognize many of the familiar puzzle types from Games Magazine and other media that Puzzability publishes in. The foreword to the book contains a casual and loosely coupled conversation between New Yorker cartoon editor Robert Mankoff and New York Times puzzle editor Will Shortz.\n\nThis is an entertaining book that you\u0027ll hate to throw away when it\u0027s been completed because of all the witty cartoons it contains. Enjoy!\n\nEileen Riebac\n",
    "\nVideohound\u0027s Cult Flicks and Trash Pics is a book that I consult often. Not only is it informative, but it\u0027s very entertaining reading as well. This is a book that any cult movie lover should own. If the names Roger Corman, Lloyd Kaufman, Ray Dennis Steckler, David Lynch, Frank Henenlotter, Jack Hill, Herschel Gordon Lewis, Dario Argento, Paul Bartel, Russ Meyer, Terry Gilliam, Alex Cox, Edward D. Wood, Ken Russell, George Romero and John Waters mean anything to you then you need this book. In addition to reviews of hundreds and hundreds of cult films, the book has lengthy bios of many of the above filmmakers as well as actors and other important cult figures. Plus there are tons of photos, there\u0027s a big specific category index to help you find exactly what you\u0027re looking for and indexes for actors, directors and writers. One of my favorite features is that nearly every page features a quote from one of the movies featured in the book. This is a great book though it\u0027s far from complete. Lots of movie geeks will be able to look through the book and point out any number of movies that were left out. However, for every movie you know of that\u0027s not in the book there are probably five that you\u0027ve never heard of. I recommend Cult Flicks and Trash Pics very highly\n",

    "\nNarrated through the heartfelt voice of Amy Tan, the Kitchen God\u0027s Wife illustrates a compelling story of heritage and self-discovery. As a young Chinese woman, Winnie Louie, the main character and the conduit through which Tan expresses her voice, must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband Wen Fu, a pretentious, arrogant, and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder, but also committed numerous felons including rape, murder, blackmailing, and extortion. Day after day, beating after beating, Winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from Wen Fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love, radical and immediate actions must be taken. When dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency, someone like Wen Fu, the usual, traditional, and orthodox actions are futile. Striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration, Tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of Winnie unfolds itself. Relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum, Tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty. Against the magnificent backdrops of a WWII-era China, the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind, that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations, regardless of race, nationality, or social status. As you read this rare gem amount literature, open the introspective window and enjoy the novel with your heart.\n",
    "\nImagine you\u0027re attending a career enhancement seminar and suddenly you\u0027re doused with a giant bucket of ice cold water. In essence, \"Fire Your Boss\" is just that. Stephen Pollan\u0027s discourse on the stark realities of the real world of work shatter all the hyperbole and fluff of \"careering\" in not just corporate America but any occupational arena. It\u0027s an easy, conversational and straightforward read that IMHO should be called \"Hire Your Boss\". Pollan, a life coach with the style, chutzpah and hubris of a Donald Trump/Scott Adams hybrid, elaborates on the criticality of taking care of your number one customer in the microeconomic marketplace-your boss. Pollan supports the essence of this approach with references to how the economic landscape has changed over the last few decades and how it\u0027s helped to perpetuate agency activity in organizations. Simply put, managers will continue to act purely out of self-interest rather than an alignment with organizational objectives. With this in mind, what will avail those of the non-management cadre the most is looking out for the needs of supervision, with more of a \"hired gun\" approach rather than that of a sycophant. Many of Pollan\u0027s precepts will at first seem counterintuitive--such as \"work for the money, the love will follow\" or \"lose your career, get a job\" and may come across as trite and cynical. However when taken in context the underlying schema is this: a job is a means of providing income-no more, no less. Trying to find personal fulfillment therein is a recipe for self-destruction. The author does a fine job of using the experiences of his clients to help illustrate these key concepts and concludes by offering a seven-step roadmap to help one achieve the empowerment and independence in the modern job market. \n\nAlthough Pollan drives across some salient points about the contemporary world of work he does tend to oversimplify a bit with regards to some management behavior. Furthermore, some of his coping strategies have the guise of tactics that only a New York Attorney could formulate. Wait-Pollan IS a New York Attorney. In sum, this is as an island of sanity in a sea of \"Be a Star at Work\" banter that perpetuates the dangling-carrot-over-the-sea-of-cubicles syndrome. Finally, when you boil this down you realize that one as an employee should consider themselves self-employed. I find it a good affirmation of what work really should be and a refreshing rebuttal to all the careering pundits whose success is predicated on the management\u0027s mystification of office life.\n\nNot for the faint of heart!\n",
    "\nI liked this book, but I notice that all the critics seem to hate it. It did take me more than a year of picking at it on and off. I picked it up because Walter Laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism. Written in 1886, it suggests that there is a pan-European anarchist underground, which the protagonist gets mixed up with. It is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy, who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction. The prose is wonderful, as is the depiction of the subtleties of the characters\u0027 personalities, if you have the taste for that sort of thing. All in all, it was worth reading and it passed the most important test for a novel: I finished it with regret. I had previously read and liked Portrait of a Lady, which is a superior novel. As much as I liked it, I would have to say do not start with Princess as an introduction to James. Incidentally, I have a theory about the omniscient narrator in James\u0027 books being a malign demiurge, but I will spare you that theorizing here\n",

    "\nLost in the Funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you aren\u0027t in the right mood for it.  If you aren\u0027t well-versed in post-modern fiction (barthelme, calvino, etc are good reference points) you might want to start somewhere else first.  Even Barth\u0027s novels are more immediately digestible.\n\nWith that said, though, this collection doesn\u0027t really operate on one consistent level.  Perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by Barth much earlier in his career.  The three stories concerning Ambrose\u0027s birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left-field with the titular \"Lost in the Funhouse\" story (which Barth is probably most known for).  From that point on, most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader, writer, and the characters.  Stories like \"Title\" and \"Life-Story\" work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction, and were (for me at least) a little tedious.  The best moments occur when Barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground-situation, typically based on Greek mythology.  The best of these are the utterly raunchy \"Petitition\" and the labyrinthine \"Menelaiad\".\n\nTaken as a whole, though, Lost in the Funhouse is greatly satisfying, even if (like me) you really only understood about 20% of what Barth was talking about on your first read-through.  It\u0027s the sort of book I\u0027ll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor.\n\nOh, and make sure to read Barth\u0027s seven additional notes at the front of the book (though maybe only after you\u0027ve read the story that is being discussed in each note, so as not to ruin the initial experience)-- they really help to clarify some of Barth\u0027s intentions.  I can\u0027t even imagine appreciating a story like \"Glossolalia\" without having read the note concerning it\n",

    "\nThough you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through, your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read Gaston Bachelard\u0027s \u0026quot;The Poetics of Space.\u0026quot;  Bachelard argues that language--especially poetry--can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space, especially of our home space.  For example, he considers how common phrases such as \u0026quot;go up to the attic\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;go down to the basement\u0026quot; are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends, while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends--in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended.  As he does with other such observations, Bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives.  In addition to exploring how we experience space and place, Bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight; roughly speaking, he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something.  By reading this beautifully written and engaging book, you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived, grown up, felt comfortable or alienated, had a feeling of wonder or fear, etc.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space, in language and what it can reveal to us, or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language\n",

    "\nI was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of Nebula Award winners. This book is not at all your typical SF story, indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some SF aspects than it does an SF story. I\u0027m an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction, so this holds a good deal of appeal for me.\n\nGriffith\u0027s prose is wonderful and showcases a beauty of language seldom seen in science fiction. Her characterization is also near perfect. I won\u0027t spend time discussing the plot as that\u0027s been handled amply by the other reviewers, but I will echo one other person\u0027s thoughts: The storyline that has Lore working at a sewage plant is, surprisingly, every bit as engrossing as the ones that deal with her kidnapping and her high society upbringing. To me, that says a good deal about Griffith\u0027s talent as a writer.\n\nAs for the sex scenes, which some people describe as being nearly constant in the book, there are actually about four or five scenes taking up somewhere around ten pages of the book (not each, but in total). Additionally, they\u0027re not placed in the story without purpose.\n\nOverall, an excellent book. Personally, I\u0027m quite glad that it won a Nebula. It\u0027s certainly desereving\n",

    "\nHave you ever been tempted to write pure nonsense?  Maybe on some rainy first day of April?  I once felt like writing:\n\n\"I sure made a mistake when I told the Goddess Minerva that She couldn\u0027t square the circle.  In response, She drew a circle next to me, a truly beautiful and perfect circle.  And right in front of my panicky brown eyes, She turned pi into four!  Not just the circumference divided by the diameter, but the series expansion as an inverse tangent as well.  What would She do next, make me unwell by dropping the first letter from my first name?  i tried to apologize, but it was too late.\"  \n\nI was not the only one to dream of mangling pi.  In \"Contact: A Novel,\" Carl Sagan went me one better when he had aliens send messages to each other at infinite speed by hiding them in a numerical representation of pi and then, you guessed it, changing pi everywhere!\n\nStill, Alan Sokal went beyond even this, getting the following published in the journal \"Social Text:\"\n\n\"In this way the infinite-dimensional invariance group erodes the distinction between the observer and the observed; the pi of Euclid and the G of Newton, formerly thought to be constant and universal, are now perceived in their ineluctable historicity; and the putative observer becomes fatally decentered, disconnected from any epistemic link to a spacetime point that can no longer be defined by geometry alone.\"  \n\nSokal put this and many more whoppers into his hoax, which defended an equally absurd thesis: that \"physical \u0027reality,\u0027 no less than social \u0027reality,\u0027 is at bottom a social and linguistic construct.\"  \n\nWhile this joke may not prove much, it does raise the issue of whether a few people in academia are misusing the vocabulary of science to create absurd statements in defense of an antirationalist point of view.  This book shows that they are.  \n\nThe authors show that Jacques Lacan makes completely arbitrary analogies between topology and psychoanalysis.  We then see some of the same irrelevance and superficial use of topology in the early works of Julia Kristeva.  After an interlude in which Sokal and Bricmont seriously discuss the philosophy of science, there are more examples of academic nonsense.  The next victim is Luce Irigaray, who in what I agree is about as ridiculously antifeminist a statement as one could make says:\n\n\"Science always displays certain choices, certain exclusions, and these are particularly determined by the sex of the scholars involved.\"\n\nThat\u0027s rich: objective truth is different depending on whether one is a Woman or a man!   I must admit that I half expected Irigaray to say that pi was different for Men and women.\n\nAfter that, we see Bruno Latour\u0027s idea that Einstein\u0027s Theory of Relativity has implications for sociology.  The authors point out that this is manifest nonsense.  Were we to discover tomorrow that the ratio of the mass of a particle to its energy were slightly different from what relativity predicted, there would be a revolution in physics, but no need to alter theories of human behavior.  \n\nLater, we see Jean Baudrillard say, \"It is a sign that the space of the event has become a hyperspace with multiple refractivity, and that the space of war has become definitively non-Euclidean.\"  And there are more, um, words, from Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Paul Virilio.  \n\nSokal and Bricmont conclude that all this inanity is a threat.  That either it will lead to even more irrationalism in academia or to an academic abandonment of social critique.  And I think it\u0027s worth warning us to avoid such a future.  But I also think we simply need social journals to get scientists to review (and reject) papers that use big scientific words instead of making coherent statements\n",

    "\nPeggy Noonan\u0027s Reagan has the texture of truth, unlike a recent Reagan bio by Richard Reeves that has the texture of slime.  Noonan\u0027s Reagan is not hagiography;  it\u0027s clear-eyed, clean, and palpably honest.  I feel Ms. Noonan\u0027s honesty just as I felt the incredible lightness of Reeves\u0027 shallowness.  \nNoonan wrote her story of a great man and the building of his character as Ronald Reagan lay dying.  Now that he\u0027s gone, Peggy Noonan is our era\u0027s great communicator.  Not every word of When Character Was King is the utterly necessary word at the absolutely necessary time -- a few of her words don\u0027t fit and an occasional fact is flubbed -- but all other words of hundreds and thousands fit perfectly into the best portrait we have of a good and great man, a description also used fittingly for Dwight Eisenhower.\nNoonan, I believe, is the only biographer of President Reagan who understands the import of a first-term footnote, an episode that most of the world has learned to forget or, like Reeves, has learned to diminish.  That\u0027s the PATCO strike which, as Noonan shows, had world-historical implications.  By the force of his focus, President Reagan used PATCO to reassert free-world mastery in our twilight struggle with an Evil Empire that was evil and that was an empire.  Thank God we had Reagan at a moment of maximum danger.  Thank God he had Noonan to tell his story\n",

Gallery owner Rogan Sweeney takes an interest in Maggie\u0027s fabulous glass creations, and soon after takes a personal interest in Maggie herself.  Maggie is a wonderful character, stubborn and flawed, yet still caring.  Nora does a fabulous job of developing Maggie, and does it in a way that she seems like a real person.  Rogan is an extremely likeable hero.  Maggie\u0027s sister, Brianna, is her complete opposite; quiet, sweet, and calm.  The relationship between the two sisters, however, is very touching and very real.  This book is full of colourful characters, some we love and some we hate.

    "\nCahill\u0027s writing is somewhat of an acquired taste. This is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained - some missing context, some missing closure. And they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense, as stories may focus on nature, archaeology, sociology, etc. While the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference, there is good information (ex. \u0026quot;wisdom\u0026quot; of cave diving). Some stories hit the vicarious adventurer\u0027s sweet spot. The author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in Kentucky, engaging the reader with educational content (ex. barometric effect on air flow), spectacular descriptions(ex. lightening igniting bat guano), and hair raising suspense (ex. getting lost in a maze of passages).

    "\n\"Spring Snow\" is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written, as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right.  It is an eloquent, moving story with a \"tale as old as time,\" that of star-crossed lovers who\u0027s love transcends social roles and obligations.\n\nIn another culture, with another writer, this would be a romantic, if not happy, story.  But this is Japan, and the writer is Mishima Yukio.  In his hands, the lovers Kiyoaki and Satoko transcend literary stereotypes, and become agents of their own happiness and destruction.  By the very nature of their relationship, raised together since childhood, playing a complicated cat-and-mouse game of love and sexual tension, their future is never in doubt.  \n\nIt is impressive that a writer such as Mishima, known for his right-wing politics and his samurai dreams, could craft such a tender love story.  While knowing the eventual conclusion, the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between Kiyoaki and Satoko, and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared.    Not that it is a clear path.  Even knowing Japanese literature, and the road it usually takes, there are surprises on the way.  Things do not turn out the way one would expect.  \n\nI was incredibly moved by \"Spring Snow.\"  It is a novel that affects the heart of the reader, and lingers long after the last page is turned. \n",
    "\nI read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market. The phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half. The raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns. Bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the \"new era\" story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay. But as shown by proven evidence of the past, no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later. When this happens, the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible. The story so far is quite simple. But what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained.\n\nThe combination of mass psychology and market prices is at the core of this book. For bubbles to happen, information flow is the key. Media plays a significant role in disseminating information and bubbles seem to have originated in recorded history after the advent of the print media. In recent times electronic media particularly the television and the internet play a significant role in speeding up bubble formation and also the reversals. Media needs a storyline and this story needs to be continued to retain customers on a daily basis. Stock market is the ideal place that offers an opportunity to try one\u0027s luck if a casino is far away. Backed by on-line dedicated news channels and internet trading, well, it is not surprising that we have day traders in herds. In such situations fundamentals like industry analysis and P/E ratios take a backseat as explained by the author. Historical averages are breached and a euphoria of \"once in a life time opportunity\" prevails. What happens to the Efficient Markets Theory in such situations?. Since this theory says that markets are perfectly priced based on all publicly available information there cannot be a situation of either under pricing or over pricing. This book perfectly challenges the efficiency and accuracy of this theory.\n\nIt is unfortunate that substantial amounts of investments meant to be otherwise risk free sources of income, pension funds for example, are getting diverted into risky markets.  Here the author has come out with a list of some sound proposals to protect hard earned life long savings of innocent citizens who are exposed to the irrationality of markets.\n\nThe bubble in the housing market is also discussed well. Housing seems to be isolated bubbles occurring in specific regions and not a global phenomenon. But nevertheless the damage can be the same. The party of low interest rate regime seems to be over and a spike in mortgage rates is sure to be the needle that will prick right through this big speculative bubble. \n\nWhat goes up has to come down ! But once you start reading this book, it is difficult to put it down. Intellectually stimulating and bound to be economically rewarding. \n",
    "\nA Late Divorce is one of my very favorites novels.  This ordinary tale about the late divorce of a middle-aged couple, one of whom is in a mental institution, is told from the perspective of each member of the family:  children, their spouses and mates, grandson,etc.  I have rarely laughed so  much, or been touched so much, by the insightful description of the Kaminka  family and their travails over a failed marriage, real estate and conflict.   The scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity  at its best...A wonderful work, original, illuminating and FUNNY\n",
    "\nI agree with the first reviewer: this is what art criticism, politically engaged or not, should read like.  Berger was an old-time Marxist; I am an Anglosphere conservative.  He is a man of the Left; I am of the Right.  No matter, his essays are the most wonderful introduction to art criticism, and at times philosophy, that I have read.  Incredibly perceptive, sensitive, without empty sentimentality but filled with genuine sentiment and deep empathy for the human condition, Berger can make any painting or work of art say more than even its author may have intended.  He uses history but is not a historicist, for  he lets the works reveal themselves openly.  The essay \"That which is held,\" a philosophic vindication of romantic love through an analysis of \"time\" is a near masterpiece of the essay form worthy of Montaigne.  Berger  will be missed in the barren landscape of contemporary Europe.  Danto and the Americans are simply not in his league\n",

If you love fantasy that involves warfare and courage with people making the best of a bad situation and with no magic items to save the day, you will love this book\n",
    "\nin order to properly understand the Jesus of the new testament, instead of making a Jesus of our own liking, it is necessary to understand Jesus as he himself indicated.  Jesus himself, according to the new testament, made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures, ( old testament ), as he sought to explain himself, his actions, his teachings and his significance.  Understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what Jesus was and is about. This means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about Noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews.  Understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it, and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole.  Christopher Wright\u0027s book, Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament, is an absolute Godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the Jesus of the new testament.  This book is a little bit technical at times, it is not a devotional work, but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of Jesus, thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of Jesus according to the background that Jesus himself referred to.    Thanks Chris Wright for this fabulous book. Also see his forthcoming book, The Mission of God, due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press. It looks to be another bullseye!!  For some other great little books on Jesus that are sane and sober, see:  Jesus and His World by Peter Walker,  The Original Jesus by N.T. Wright, and for a bit of a larger work see Jesus and The Gospels by Craig Blomberg\n",
    "\nThis book provides a straight-forward approach to a raw-food diet, and the changes required to maintain the health of your pet through the process.  It also helps to have someone who can assist you in locating the ingredients locally, but Schultze provides all the requisite information that you will need.  A great resource to go to when you get a nagging question, or have a concern.  Try not to let people talk you out of trying the diet, as you WILL see changes in the health of your pet; many veterinarians that I have spoken with are not particularly supportive.  My 2 y/o Lab has a softer coat, clearer eyes, and better muscle tone since I have started him on the diet.  This diet is slightly more expensive than feeding dog chow, but the reward of having a healthy, happy pet far outweigh the associated costs.  Good luck, and enjoy your pet\n",

You may even feel threatened to the point that you negatively review it.

    "\nThe mysterious oriental mirror is ugly, and it has powers that wield themselves on the unexpected.  It wreaks havoc and sometimes kills, as is the case with several people in this book.  The rest are either thought mad or driven mad.  Question:  If you could, would you switch places with somebody else in a different time?  I think I might, but I would like to be given a choice.  Brandy McCabe and her granddaughter Shay Garrett aren\u0027t given that choice.  Both are 20 years old and about to marry men neither love when the mirror transports them into each other\u0027s bodies.\n\nMarlys Millhiser has woven a complex and fascinating story of culture shock in which Brandy becomes her granddaughter and Shay becomes her grandmother.  Shay is thought crazy in the early 1900s because she can tell the future, and she keeps a diary to tell her grandmother how she has lived out her life should she return to her own body one day.  Her story and how she deals with a pre-citified Boulder, Colorado is the most interesting segment of the book, but I didn\u0027t feel sorry for Shay as much as I admired her strength of character.  She also had her mother\u0027s stories of her ancestors to go on, but this was not the case for poor Brandy.  The Garrett\u0027s and Shay\u0027s fiancee\u0027 don\u0027t know what to do with a pregnant Shay who is terrified and clueless about the year 1978, but they know after discovering the diary that she really is Brandy.  \n\nThe story is often heartbreaking, often times quite funny, and there are so many supporting and unforgettable characters--like the lovable Thora K., Brandy\u0027s first mother-in-law and the old man who takes care of Shay when she runs away from her family--that this book is not only compelling, but also makes you think about your own place in this world.  What Shay and Brandy do have in common is Rachel, Brandy\u0027s daughter and Shay\u0027s mother.  Now picture those two being in each other\u0027s place when you think of that!  \n\nSomebody here called the book a literary classic; I wouldn\u0027t go that far, but it is excellent, regardless.  The Mirror is magical storytelling any way you look at it, so let it weave it\u0027s spell on you.        \n",

    "\nHaving read Katherine, I wanted to get my hands on another Anya Seton novel. Her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the Medieval and Renaissance eras are breathtaking. People recommended Green Darkness because of its timeless romance, historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation. So I gave Green Darkness a whirl. This enormous book (a big trade paperback with over six-hundred pages) enthralled me from beginning to end and I wish it had been longer, that the magic hadn\u0027t ended. Despite its rather large size and intricate story, the novel ended too soon for me. (I like big books, but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume.) I finished this gem in three sittings. The novel\u0027s setting begins in the late 1960s (around the year this was first published). Richard Mardson takes his beloved wife, the American heiress Celia Taylor, to his estate in Sussex, England. There he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers, all respectable noblemen and women like Richard. But something strange begins to happen between them. Celia is experiencing deja vu, as though she\u0027d been there before. This happens the second she enters the castle. At the same time, Richard becomes restless and moody. Celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her. Their lives and their marriage could be in shambles, and Celia has to go back to her previous life during Tudor England to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time. Her past life is a woman named Celia Bohun who falls for a handsome monk named Stephen (Richard) Mardson. Their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering. There are many twists throughout the novel.\n\nI have read few novels that had made me go through as many emotions as this one had done. Celia and Stephen\u0027s love for one another was something truly beautiful and tragic at the same time. This novel brought me to tears by the time I finished. The building of tension between the protagonists is almost palpable. Celia is a very complex heroine. She is proud and innocent, but also could be quite the vixen when she sets her mind to it, especially when Stephen is involved. Stephen is a tall, dark and gorgeous hero who has taken a vow of chastity for his religion, but his attraction to Celia is undeniable and it is something that torments him. This part of his personality makes him a tortured soul and he is very appealing as a result. The part in which Celia looks after him when he falls ill is one of the sexiest scenes in the novel. It has a mixture of eroticism and innocence, for it is the first time Celia sees Stephen\u0027s nude body. The romance is indeed wonderful, but the historical references make this novel all the richer and more palatable. We experience all of the things that occurred during Tudor England, from Henry VIII\u0027s reign passing on to Queen Mary and onto Queen Elizabeth I. I have been reading quite a lot of historical/biographical novels and finding this book was like finding hidden treasure. You feel the time period and the events that took place in those times. The most insightful things for me were those centered on Queen Mary\u0027s persecution of Protestants and all the historical things that occur while time passes after the scandal centered on Celia\u0027s love for Stephen. The ending is one of the best endings I have read. Green Darkness is a true treasure that all historical enthusiasts should own. The story is quite intricate, not an easy read by a long shot (I find that most novels that center on reincarnation are very complex), but the overall development of the story is extremely well woven and beautifully executed. There are numerous characters in this novel, but I never felt like I had to keep up with them in order to remember them. Each character serves his or her purpose and I loved them (or hated them if they were villains). The one thing that puzzled me was the emphasis on Mabel\u0027s weight. I thought plump women were considered prettier in those times. And Celia (the twentieth century one) sounds a little too British for an American who\u0027d set foot in England for the first time. Other than those negligible details, Green Darkness is perfect. Anya Seton was a great author, one of the best in her time. I think I like this novel more than Katherine. I wonder if Anya Seton and this novel inspired Jude Deveraux to write Remembrance (which I read at the same time as this one), which is another romance centered on soul mates and past lives partly set in the sixteenth century. Anyway, Green Darkness is one of the best historical/paranormal novels out there and I cannot recommend this memorable gem enough\n",
    "\nA Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time.  True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible.  Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.\n\nWith a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist.  Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno.  I won\u0027t serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.\n\nVernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint.  Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time.  Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth.  Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body.  And if you take Verne\u0027s theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.\n\nHowever, I do have a couple minor gripes.  Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel.  Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line.  Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won\u0027t reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., \"the bends\").  Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.\n\nThe nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time.  A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne\u0027s vision of a subterranean world.  Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes\u0027 works still inspire awe and imagination\n",
    "\n  I was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here.  Even more stunned by the criticisms.  This is not a scientific treatise, and never pretends to be.  This is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of Emergence, nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper.\n\n  This is an interesting, graspable, exciting and intelligently written book about a phenomenon which is absolutely, positively crucial to understand.  To some people Emergence is a particular abstract in a particular field - those people were disappointed and found this \"light reading\" - which is really too bad, because they are the ones who NEED this book the most.  Alas, we can expect it to be a while before these \"scientist\" can look outside their own shallow mud-puddles of their over-specialties to see how applicable emergent theory is to the world we are immersed in, both natural and man-made.\n\n   If you didn\u0027t find this book exciting, you didn\u0027t read it.  Sit down and read it without distraction and prejudice.  Let Johnson do what he does best; take you on a journey of ideas and concepts.  Sure, some of it is simplified for the lay-reader, but anybody who isn\u0027t a total couch-potato is going to find the content interesting enough to set-out and search for details on their own.  It isn\u0027t Johnson\u0027s goal to elaborate on some trivial and fragmentary specialty that only people with masters degrees and secured positions in academia could possibly enjoy or tolerate.  \n\n  His goal is to show what emergence IS and why it is SO important, how vast the concepts are in their potential application in every imaginable field, and how elegant, simple, complex, chaotic, and BEAUTIFUL emergence IS !\n\n   And he does exactly this quite well.  If you read this book and are not excited, you didn\u0027t get it.  Read it again.  And again.  Look up the examples of emergence, and try to actually find your own examples of emergence in YOUR world, in YOUR daily experience.  The enrichment you\u0027ll gain from it will be worth a lot more than any silly over-specialty in an obscure field of research that nobody has ever hear\n",

    "\nThis is in my opinion John Bradshaw\u0027s best book. It encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions, addictions, co-dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes.\n\nIn this volume, John Bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops and leads to the breakdown of families. He also talks about how this cycle is perpetuated through generations and actually covers a lot of ground in terms of family dynamics.\n\nThrough affirmations, working with feelings, visualizations and other techniques, the author shows the reader how to work through toxic shame. As someone who has done the work himself, he comes across as compassionate, knowledgeable and very practical.\n\nSometimes I get annoyed when I read this book because of unnecessary repetition of some key concepts. This is the explanation for my 4 rating, along with the fact that many of his books overlap each other with respect to content. Therefore, my overall rating is that this is a solid, well-written classic that certainly deserves its best-seller status. However, prepare yourself for some repetition and unnecessarily long examples of what he is talking about.\n",
    "\nI love this book!  I love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last (I say maybe because originally Buddies was supposed to be the last).  It is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested.  My love for Dennis Savage\u0027s irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with Little Kiwi.  My love for Little Kiwi\u0027s innocence becomes concern for his actions.  It\u0027s like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result, the choices that they make are theirs, and there\u0027s nothing you can do about it, but let them be chosen.  It\u0027s hard letting Little Kiwi grow up and become Virgil Brown.  I imagine it\u0027s the same way with a child, but at least then you get to see what happens!  Mind you, the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle, feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next.  But just like \u0026quot;Just Above My Head\u0026quot; by James Baldwin (which I highly recommend), I have been unable to pick up this book and read it again.  It simply leaves me realing with so many feelings, yet I would not trade the experience reading it with anything.  How does one mix merriment with malaise so well?  Read the book and find out\n",

    "\nCollins\u0027 efforts with his justly famed \u0026quot;The Moonstone\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;The Woman in White\u0026quot; have perhaps overshadowed his very fine work as seen in \u0026quot;Armadale.\u0026quot;  Lydia Gwilt (don\u0027t you love the last name?) is one of the great unsung characters in English (or any western) literature.  Collins seems to delight in making her as full-bodied, as attractive to men, and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire.  Given the tenor and social conventions of the time, her quest for revenge on the despicable Alan Armadale seems perfectly in keeping.  Lydia Gwilt is like an early, English Scarlett O\u0027Hara without the redeeming humor Scarlett was known to exhibit.  All in all, an extraordinarily well-written and three-dimensional character study\n",
    "\nI evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that I needed more protein than I had thought and that I reacted strongly to sugars.  I bought this book when I decided to lose a few pounds, but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet.  I was already having gall bladder and liver issues.  I bought this book first and 2.5 years later, it is still the best reference I have.  The chapter on hormones is a bit technical, but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  \n\nWithin three days of eliminating grains from my diet, I no longer cared whether or not I lost weight.  My awful blood sugar drops and painful bloating were gone, my energy increased significantly and within weeks I noticed that the gall bladder pain was gone (and it hasn\u0027t come back).  Within three months my intense hot flashes disappeared and I started sleeping better.  \n\nThe book first describes what low carb nutrition is, then goes on to discuss hormones and how insulin impacts the overall balance of the body\u0027s hormones in different ways.  It addresses overall energy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, vitamins and minerals, and weight control (one chapter - the rest is on health issues). \n",

    "\nOn the surface, Natsuo Kirino gives us a book loaded with nail-biting, page turning suspense.  What lies beneath is a scathing commentary on the social climate for women in Japan.  Women are seen as beautiful young pets, or useless old bags.  Kirino shows a side of Japan that I didn\u0027t know existed.\n\nKirino\u0027s brilliant characterization makes this book work.  Every person is fleshed out within the context of the story, and flashbacks are only used when absolutely necessary.  I never felt like the story was on hold while I learned about someone\u0027s childhood.  I can\u0027t stand it when writers stop a story cold just to fill in holes that they have created.  Kirino doesn\u0027t have that problem.\n\nThe book has a bit of a slow start, but it is necessary for the author to paint a picure of the mundane world the characters live in before things start to heat up.  The story picks up momentum and charges through to a brilliant ending (I have to disagree with other reviewers who disliked the ending. If you don\u0027t like the ending, you may be missing the point of the whole book). The plot twists manage to surprise the reader without feeling forced. Kirino\u0027s style is concise and well-paced.\n\nMy one complaint is that it is difficult to keep the characters straight because of their similar names.  With names like Yayoi, Yoshie, and Yoko it\u0027s hard to know who\u0027s who at times.  This may show my American ignorance, but I have to admit that this was a problem for me.\n\nThis minor complaint aside, I loved this book and I highly recommend it to all fans of crime fiction\n",

Since we don\u0027t understand the brain, or why it does things, how can we assume that brain scans actually tell anyone anything? Choosing a positive perspective about annoying behavior is a good start. The book is worth your time, but you should also check out Hallowell or Ingersoll\n",
    "\nAmong all the theories of ethics with which I am familiar, I have always found Kant\u0027s system to be the best: carrying out one\u0027s duty for the sake of the duty itself. The problem with Kant, however, is that his theory of morality is grounded outside humanity, dependent on a source of which we can never, some may claim, have any understanding. Christine Korsgaard fixes, at least for me, this problem, by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality. In short, the source of normativity is our humanity itself.\n\nI don\u0027t want to get into too much details and give away the main points of the book. Suffice it to say that it offers, in my opinion, some of the best arguments for the objectivity of morality. The conclusion I reached after reading the book was this: It is as much justified for a human to complain \u0027Why should I be moral?\u0027 as it is for him/her to complain \u0027Why should I have two eyes?\u0027 In both cases, the answer is \u0027Because you are a human being, a social animal with two eyes.\u0027\n",

    "\nWells wrote The Time Machine (1895) rather furiously; it seems the author was short of money and exploited his idea of future time travel, summing it up in a tightly constructed, very short novel. Most works that I have read from the nineteenth century are long-winded, purple-toned, velvet-like effluviums. This one is short and for once I would have liked a book a bit wordier.\n\nAnyhow, the narrator, a sort of mad tinkerer, describes his visit 800,000+ years to the future. He finds two distinct inheritors of the human race: one smallish, simple-minded but joyful class of vegetarian people that live on the surface of the Earth (the Eloi), and one larger brute-like class of photophobic ground dwellers that perform most of the work for the Eloi, but unfortunately also eat them. Gone are most of the trappings of modern society. Humans have devolved into beautiful idiots and those that prey upon them.\n   \nDarwin\u0027s theories of evolution and natural selection were just beginning to take hold at the time Wells was writing and they obviously influence the work. I read somewhere that Wells took a university course taught by the biologist T.H. Huxley, who highly regarded Darwin\u0027s theories. Socialism also influences the book, with the Morlock underclass literally kept in the dark until they devolve into creatures that cannot tolerate light and have to rely on human flesh for food. Part of socialist theory is conflict theory; so instead of cannibalizing their own, the Morlocks eat the Eloi as a sort of vengeance.\n\nDarkness, and the use of the dark as something mysterious from out which monsters may jump, is Gothic old hat for early writers of this genre. Wells uses the dark as the place where the Morlocks are banished, and where the Time-traveler believes the Morlocks have his stolen time machine. We feel the Gothic fear when he knows he has to go down there to attempt to get it back. Also, I wouldn\u0027t say Wells is the first to blend science with fiction either; see Hawthorne\u0027s \"Rappaccini\u0027s Daughter\", Mary Shelley\u0027s Frankenstein or Edgar Allan Poe. And is there something unsettling about the Time-traveler\u0027s undertaking with the childlike Weena? Her death at the hands of the Morlocks is tragic, but imagine the circus-spectacle she would make if the narrator brought her back to his time as he intended\n",

    "\nCarol Kuykendall --- author, speaker, and strategic projects director for MOPS International (Mothers of Preschoolers) --- has compiled what she considers the five-star winning components of a successful family. According to this mom of three grown children, the five key elements of a great family begin with love -- expressions that inspire and comfort; fun -- activities that recharge a family\u0027s batteries; loyalty -- lessons on sticking with family through it all; growth -- embracing new challenges and seeing the value of stretching; and faith -- holding close a relationship with Christ that shines vividly and practically into the lives of others. With many personal anecdotes, fanciful stories, and good common sense advice, Kuykendall does a marvelous job presenting a handbook for parents that is easy on both the eyes and the heart.\n\nThe author\u0027s two-part text deals with family matters that focus on the beginnings of new family life when a young couple first discovers they\u0027re pregnant. Some of the practical points offered in this section include deciding who to invite to the actual delivery, naming the baby by taking into account potential teasing/taunting as a result of this all-important choice, hashing out basic parenting decisions regarding naps/nursing/discipline, dealing with those unmet expectations that crop up almost immediately after giving birth, and learning to fit into the extended family with the newest member without stepping on other siblings\u0027 toes or feelings.\n\nKuykendall then delves into dreaming for a bit. Just what kind of family does the new couple want to be? The author discusses the value of looking back in order to glean the best of past childhoods while wisely leaving not-so healthy patterns behind where they belong. She also details the importance of taking a realistic look at where a family is today, accepting where people are, because this is the point from which everyone can move ahead. Finally, a brief segment on looking ahead with hopeful, faith-inspired enthusiasm closes out this foundational topic.\n\nTo complete part one, Kuykendall does a lovely job presenting the \"gifts\" children bring to a family. Clearly, children are gifts from God, but with them come powerful life lessons on perspective. Consider the gift of \"do-overs,\" in which parents can relive the innocence and wonder of childhood discovery through their children\u0027s eyes. This important truth reminds parents that God is the giver of second chances. Kuykendall also cites the gifts of humility as children \"reveal us to ourselves\" as imperfect parents. Children also model sincerity of a simple, uncomplicated faith.\n\nOnce this solid foundation is set, Kuykendall spends a generous amount of space re-defining her five-star qualities, each with its own separate chapter (Love, Fun, Loyalty, Growth, Faith). Every chapter opens with a lengthy discussion that includes biblical principles and selected bible verses, personal insights from the author\u0027s own family life, specific action points, and quippy yet powerful quotations for increased take-away reminders. One of the most telling quotations included in this timely text appears near the end, and it typifies Kuykendall\u0027s entire message beautifully. \"Family is...A soft place to land.\"\n\n\n   --- Reviewed by Michele How\n",

    "\nI got my copy of \u0026quot;The Five Keys to Value Investing\u0026quot; as a graduation gift from my dad who is a longtime professional equities investor.  He thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before I start my career on Wall Street.  I was not disappointed.  The Five Keys is a very good summary of what I learned in business school and much, much more.  The author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like Buffett and Graham.  The experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile; but what makes this book very special is the framework.  I have read several investment books over the years, but none like this one.  Putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw.  In addition, reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work.  The clarity in the concepts and the \"conversation-like\" tone was particularly attractive to me. In sum, this is a very coherent, practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective -- considering the authors\u0027 strong unapologetic bias towards value investing\n",
    "\nWhen I first started reviewing children\u0027s books on Amazon.com I gave myself a long list of rules to follow.  And one of those rules stated that I was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until AFTER I\u0027d written my own review.  I wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure, filled only with my own thoughts (which I obviously mistook to be brilliant) and feelings.  After a while though I gave up on this rule.  By and large (and this is not speaking for all reviews... just 90% of them) a review for a children\u0027s book goes something along the lines of \"It was good, my four-year-old requests it every night, buy this book, etc.\".  Nothing too shocking or revealing.  So I grew lazy.  I started reading other reviews of picture books long before I sat down to actually write a review of my own.  Just moments ago I went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book, \"Martin\u0027s Big Words\".  This book was on my list of must-reads because it had garnered itself a Caldecott Honor years before.  So I went to the appropriate Amazon.com page (much as you are now) and read the first review on the list.  At the time, it was an unassuming July 18, 2002 review entitled, \"There\u0027s Something Wrong Here...\".  I read the review.  I digested the review.  And I came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones.  Ones that I should consider, dare I say, in my OWN review.  This is unprecedented.  Never has a review for a book, a children\u0027s book, really hit home for me like this one did.  So to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002, I commend you.  And to myself, a mental whipping for breaking my own rules.  It\u0027s a hard act to follow, but I\u0027ve a point or two of my own to make and I\u0027m gonna make `em.\n\t\nNow  as a children\u0027s librarian I get a whole heaping helpful of small children coming in around January 17th (or just before) requesting books on Martin Luther King Jr.  For the older children, such requests are usually easy enough to fulfill.  But for little ones with short attention spans and even shorter vocabularies, the choices are limited.  Fortunately, there\u0027s, \"Martin\u0027s Big Words\".  A beautiful encapsulation of the life of the great man, the book shows Martin as a child, first encountering the insanity of segregation.  We see him grow up and preach a gospel of love and acceptance.  Following this are small looks at the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, civil rights marches, and his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.  Finally, while marching with striking garbage collectors (a fact not often mentioned in children\u0027s biographies of King), he was shot and killed.  Says the book at the end, \"His big words are alive for us today\".  \n\t\nThe book is stunning to look at, you know.  The endpapers consist of pane after pane of brown, peach, amber, and umber stained glass.  Taken together, the stained glass appears to be a variety of different skin tones all working together to make something beautiful.  Using collage, illustrator Bryan Collier peppers his unique style with symbolic images (such as four lit candles placed in remembrance of the girls killed in the Sixteenth Street Baptist church).  In the rest of the book, Collier\u0027s images leap off the page.  They\u0027re bright, colorful and eclectic.  Combined with author Doreen Rappaport\u0027s elegant eloquent narrative, children get a full understanding of the courage and greatness behind Dr. King\u0027s life and actions.  \n\t\nSo what about the complaints of this book?  Let\u0027s examine them fully.  First of all, one criticism is that in the image of the civil rights march there are thirteen men on display, none of whom are either white or female.  This is true.  And it is a little odd.  Not don\u0027t-buy-this-book odd.  Just why-did-the-illustrator-make-that-choice odd.  From looking at the picture I can only assume that Collier was working off a snapshot of a portion of a march from the past and didn\u0027t notice that it was a bit skewed.  The other criticism of the book is that whites are only portrayed as evil rednecks that want to kill Dr. King.  I dunno.  The book says plenty of things about diversity and the coming together of the races.  As for the lack of positive white images, I admit they\u0027re not present in this particular book.  However, the world is filled to overflowing with books that DO present positive images of white people.  As a white person myself, I\u0027m sick to death of \u0027em.  And I\u0027d gladly exchange four or five hundred such books for a single one that was half as beautifully illustrated and written as \"Martin\u0027s Big Words\".  \n\t\nSo yeah, the book has a flaw here or there.  But it also fills a need.  However important you deem it that your children see positive images of whites during the Freedom Marches is your prerogative.  But don\u0027t pass \"Martin\u0027s Big Words\" by because it fails to fully display the diversity of the 60s in your eyes.  It\u0027s a great book with a great message.  It\u0027s also one of the few King bios that\u0027ll capture your seven-year-old\u0027s attention for longer than a minute.  A great addition to any library and a necessary purchase for anyone who wants to teach their small child about a magnificent man.\n",
    "\nI loved this book.  I love it so much, I want to give copies to my sisters, my friends and to get my husband to read it.  The ideas seem so simple and straight forward, that when you read it, you say \"of course, I can do that in my life.\"\nMuch of it covers identifying your goals, focusing on those and affirming that you can achieve them.  I found it very rational and not just wishful thinking.  \nI really like the exercises included in some chapters.  One exercise was to write a description of what would be a your perfect day.  He explains the purpose of each exercise and ask questions/gives direction for carrying it out.\nIt\u0027s the type of book that can be sampled and parts re-read at intervals to reinforce your efforts for a happier life\n",

    "\nIbn Batuta describes his encounters with peoples and lands west of his native Tangiers (Morocco) in the 14 C. By avoiding to travel the same route twice, he comes to the same places a number of times (Baghdad, Delhi) spinning and zigzagging his ways through mountains and seas. As he explores with brio this world, he unfolds himself and as in most cross-cultural encounters, this maybe one of the most interesting features of the book. He accepts miraculous events with a candor I have not found in any other Middle Age traveler of those lands (from Marco Polo to the Jesuits). He gives little description of the way people live in the places he visits - which I regret - apart from detailed descriptions of the gowns and other garments he is given by some of the Sheikhs of the places he visits. The descriptions of how those sheikhs succeeded to govern illustrate how (extremely) fragile power was and is in those regions. \nNames are sometimes difficult to relate to those we know - which is regretful. \nDon\u0027t follow Ibn Batuta\u0027s advice, read (and enjoy) the book twice\n",

    "\nThere are many books out there about the supposed strengths or weaknesses of globalization and free trade, but at least in terms of the international movement of capital, you\u0027ll usually find mere boosterism and ideology. At last, Paul Blustein has given us a look at the real-life effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation. Here we have an in-depth and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of Argentina\u0027s economy in 2001-2002, which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship. You won\u0027t be surprised to see the word \"bubble\" regularly, as Blustein covers the surprisingly slow-moving factors that added up to disaster over several years, with many mistakes made by all parties along the way. \n\nIn addition to some financial mismanagement and damaging internal politics within Argentina itself, Blustein also explains errors made by the IMF and the Clinton and Bush administrations, and unhealthy speculation by foreign investors who had no regard for the outcomes of their actions. Not to mention, Argentina was the punching bag for an international monetary system that is built to ensure short-term rewards for speculators, plus an ideology that believes it to be acceptable when elites in rich countries profit while regular people in developing nations are left holding the bag when the bubble bursts. I would also recommend this book for those with a general interest in international monetary matters, as Bluestein does a marvelous job explaining phenomena like currency exchange rates, international debt and equity markets, and other financial concepts that you may wish to understand more deeply. If you\u0027re an ideologue in love with the supposed panacea of free markets, thinking that the unfettered movement of capital around the world will raise all ships, you might have your worldview shot down by Blustein and his excellent look at Argentina\u0027s misery.

Like, fresh vegatables can be eaten with anything but starches don\u0027t digest well with meat. There are stages to going *Raw* that Ms. Rose has honestly and clearly put out there. Our bodies just can\u0027t go Raw over night. Yhere is a change in the digestive system. I know from my experience how my body feels when I eat raw for several days and then introduce the wrong combonation of foods. I feel like I\u0027m suffering at the toilet.Sorry. Natalie gets you through the stages of developing this life style. It\u0027s a Detox program not a cookbook. It has recipes for all the stages to going *Raw. Ms. Rose hershelf claims it took several years for her to go completely Raw. The recipes are for those various stages. I don\u0027t find anything wrong with this book. As far as enzymes. All foods have them, and yes our body has them too. When cooking foods you are breaking down the enzymes that are packed with nutrients. That simple. We want to incorporate more enzymes or natural living food into our bodies. \n\nAnd if you read your Bible...you will know what it means to eat pure food. Eat what the Lord has provided for you. You best optimal health can continue and grow from eating more living foods. \n\nI was on this plan for a month. Without exercise I did the stage 3 and followed through the evening. I lost 16lbs in a month! I didn\u0027t even do an enema yet. My body was doing well everyday several times a day getting rid of the waste I\u0027ve manage to occumalate. I didn\u0027want to wear my food anymore. My insulin was way off from process snacks. This really help me feel the difference and pay respect to the best thing I could have done for myself.

Though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of Mao\u0027s life or policies, it is best to look elsewhere.  This book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of Mao\u0027s life and work and ideas.  Perfect for people curious about Mao and twentieth century China who want to read more than an abstract, but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work.  Just the facts and little commentary.  Spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for Mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences\n",

The sisters--who are highly educated, pensive, and artistic--become entangled with the Wilcox family--practical, unilateral capitalists--and the Basts--working class and unassuming. However, the initially subtle differences between the sisters (and how they approach love, misfortune, and personal relations) become more obvious as the novel progresses, climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a high-brow English novel.

    "\nThe narrator of Joe Perrotta\u0027s novel \"Joe College\" is Danny, an English major at Yale. Stuck with the peculiarities of his roommates, and with a horrendous crush on a fellow student named Polly, Danny struggles to complete his junior year. While home in New Jersey on a summer break, Danny drives his father\u0027s lunch wagon \"The Roach Coach.\" And this is how he meets Cindy, a pleasant, chatty secretary. Danny compares her to the girls on the Yale campus, and the comparison is not flattering to Cindy. He\u0027s faintly embarrassed by her, and while she\u0027s ok to date when he\u0027s home in New Jersey, he\u0027s ashamed of the relationship when he returns to Yale.\n\nOnce again, Perrotta presents the theme of escape from New Jersey, and in the novel, Danny\u0027s escape is temporarily through Yale, but ultimately through education. Cindy represents everything Danny is trying to escape--a lifetime driving the Roach Coach, and Danny knows far too many people who made huge mistakes and ended up trapped forever in New Jersey. \n\nClass is another theme in the novel--during the school year, Danny works in a cafeteria. The employees and the Townies are all too well aware that their lives are mapped out--whereas the Yale students seem to have vast, limitless opportunities. While Danny\u0027s background is humble, and his parents have made tremendous sacrifices to send him to Yale, he rubs shoulders with peers who come from incredibly wealthy homes. To them, Yale doesn\u0027t quite hold the desperate stakes that face Danny. When it comes to making some rather questionable moral choices, Danny nakedly examines his motives, and simply shrugs. While this does not make Danny a heroic narrator, it certainly makes him very real and very human. As a Perrotta fan, I hope that the author rediscovers Danny in another novel. In \"Joe College\" Danny\u0027s moral fibre is still quite plastic, and he may prove to be fascinating in middle age--displacedhuma\n",
    "\nTHE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, guitar), Kirk Hammett (guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums \u0026 percussion), and new member Jason Newsted (bass) formerly of Flotsam And Jetsam (replacing Cliff Burton, R.I.P.). \n\nTHE DISC: (1988) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 65 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, band pictures, one \u0027gavel\u0027 drawing containing  band member faces, and thank you\u0027s. This is Metallica\u0027s 4th studio album. All songs written by Hetfield, Hammett, Ulrich and/or Newsted. Recorded at One On One Studios, Los Angeles, CA. This would be Flemming Rasmussen\u0027s last album produced with the band (Bob Rock would follow). The Japanese (import) version contains a bonus track - a Diamond Head cover, \"The Prince\". Label - Elektra.\n\nCOMMENTS: \"...And Justice For All\" was the last classic Metallica album of the 80\u0027s. It was also their final attempt at thrash metal (once the 90\u0027s rolled around and producer Bob Rock entered the picture, the band took a more \"mainstream\" metal approach). The majority of songs are long with complex riffs... borderline progressive. Let me first say that for years, this disc sat on my shelf. I thought it was over-produced; I didn\u0027t like Ulrich\u0027s snare drum (sounded cheap and tinny) or his double bass (sounded shallow and metallic - partly due to a coin taped to the drum skin where the foot pedal hit); Newsted\u0027s bass was nonexistent (the standard explanation for this combines Newsted\u0027s absence from the mixing sessions where he could have voiced his opinion, and the lingering issue of his \"newness\" within the band following the death of Burton); there were three songs that I just could not get into (\"Eye Of The Beholder\", \"The Shortest Straw\" and lightning fast \"Dyers Eve\"); and the articles I read about the 3 original band members hazing and not accepting newcomer Newsted was infuriating... call if fun, call it pranks, call it cruel - Newsted simply did not deserve this kind of treatment. Newsted (or anyone else who took the job) had two choices - put up with the crap or leave. From the outside looking in, Burton\u0027s loss was tragic, but the way Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett handled the situation afterwards seemed uncalled for. As far as \"...And Justice For All\" is concerned though, it\u0027s taken a decade to grow on me and finally realize there are some brilliant songs here. In my opinion, \"One\" is one of Metallica\u0027s finest songs in their entire catalog. \"One\" has an awesome slow beginning, tells a great story of an injured soldier, and ends in fine metal thrash form (not to mention one of the more memorable MTV videos)... all in all featuring great guitar work (intro, rhythm and solos). \"Blackened\" is an underrated gem of an opener. \"To Live Is To Die\" is the other masterpiece (almost 10 minutes long) - riffs and spoken words written by Cliff Burton (his last written testament) - this song has great riffs and 7 minutes of jamming before any vocals... reminiscent of something taken right off \"Master Of Puppets\". The title track also resembles something from \"Puppets\". \"...And Justice For All\" chart success - hitting #6 on Billboard\u0027s \"Top 200 Albums\" from 1988, as well as the song \"One\" hitting #35 on Billboard\u0027s Hot 100. There\u0027s good and bad here... this album is still considered a classic and essential. If not only for the songs \"One\", \"Blackened\" and \"To Live Is To Die\" (4 stars).\n",
    "\nI just finished my second reading of it.\n\nI really cannot add much to the great reviews already written. I\u0027ve always loved Dickens\u0027 way with words, and this book is a treasure in that department. The English, the Era, the characters, the countryside.... it got to the point where I couldn\u0027t wait for the evening to come so I could continue reading.\n\nThis also seems to me to be an important \"cornerstone book\" for other great English literature. The theme (though just a seed) for  Scrooge in A Christmas Carol begins here, in a story called The Goblin Who Stole a Sexton, a story related during one of Pickwick\u0027s Christmastime visits to a friend in the country. When reading The Wind in the Willows or Tolkien\u0027s works, I cannot escape the feeling that they were also influenced by the charm, the sense of humor (okay, humour), duty to friends, and the simple but most important things in life which Dickens so impressively describes.\n\nThe only negative thing is that I discovered that it had an effect on me which made me wish that I was free from the drudgery of daily work, was retired (with ample monetary means, of course, like Pickwick himself), and could devote the remainder of my life to similar ramblings, adventures, and pursuits.\n\nAn excellent book\n",
    "\nI first read this extraordinary book in 1986, just two years after it was first published.  Picking it up again, I find it eerily applicable to our current situation. There is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings this message back to the forefront.\n\nBarbara W. Tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests. Mind you, this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous. And, yes, I admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20.\n\nBeginning with the Trojans and their acceptance of the Trojan Horse to benighted Papal policy during the renaissance to Britain\u0027s stupidity during the American Revolution to questionable American policy during the Vietnam war, THE MARCH OF FOLLY invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does.\n\nGiven our current war policies, efforts and mistakes in Iraq, Tuchman\u0027s masterpiece is a very poignant read and we must confess, regardless of individual political leanings, that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable. Who knows, there may yet be a sequel to this one appropriately titled THE MARCH CONTINUES.\n\nTHE HORSEMA\n",

    "\nA looming 21-year High School reunion has led me to ponder the past, especially the town I grew up in. I have been reading The Geography of Nowhere by James Howard Kuntsler, a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in America. Kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy (Le Corbusier, Gropius, Bauhaus etc. ) . Although Kunstler\u0027s book is by no means a complete history, his insights are provocative. His basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless \u0026quot;geography of nowhere\u0026quot;. In other words, since the 1920s, Americans have pursued a single-minded vision when it comes to urban development: namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold, with little regard to aesthetics.\n \n Growing up in a suburb, I experienced this sort of fake-non-reality-bubble of what a city should be, or what it should do for its residents. There was always nothing to do, nowhere to go. Fortunately, in those days, creative people created their own \u0026quot;scene\u0026quot;, no matter how lame it was. Such a naive scene based on our libertine tastes and overbearing ignorance. Of course, conformity was the rule.\n \n And we all nearly s--t ourselves when we got behind the wheel of our first car. It was almost like and 5-year-old\u0027s first trip to Disneyland. It was like that first sexual experience. It was an epiphany, of sorts.\n \n Little did we realize that our addiction to auto travel would bring such a high cost to our lonely empty souls.

His disciplined, almost scientific investigation is an example of non-partisan coverage of a crucial issue.

I am a Mexican citizen so I couldn\u0027t care less about U.S. partisan politics, and if you care about the fate of public communications, you shouldn\u0027t either. This is a problem that affects every country, not just the U.S.A., since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the World.

    "\nWoodward and Bernstein, famous reporters for the Washington Post during the Watergate scandal, chronicle their experience investigating and exposing the deceptive actions of President Nixon and his cronies during Watergate.  This book takes the reader through Woodward and Bernstein\u0027s efforts at uncovering the truth, internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering, and covert meetings with confidential sources.  They tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world\u0027s best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the US Presidency was respected above all else.\n\nThis book is a fascinating look at how investigative journalism once was.  Instead of printing first and asking questions later, Woodward and Bernstein, along with their editors, took painstaking efforts at checking, double checking, and even triple checking their sources and information before putting something derogatory in print.  It seems a sharp contrast to journalism today that appears to be publish now, ask questions later, and file a retraction in small print even later.  This book also tells the tale of two very opposite reporters and how they pulled together to write about the crime spree of the century and topple a corrupt Presidency.

    "\nA lot of the reviews I have read here, both positive and negative, have noted Smith\u0027s acerbic and sometimes hostile tone. In my own discussions on god, particularly when engaging Christians, I probably would not use SOME of the more harsh language found in the book. It tends to be devisive and unproductive, and also reinforcing many of the deragatory stereotypes that are applied to Atheists.\n\nThat does not mean that any of Smith\u0027s arguments are not legitimate or powerful. They should be confronted by ANYONE who takes any position regarding religion or god.\n\nPerhaps the most revealing and important passage of the work comes at the beginning of the Chapter discussing the purported \"proofs\" for the existence of good posited by Christian Thealogians and laymen. \n\nSmith explains that \"Many times in the past, before knowing better, I would engage in arguments with theists who claimed to have a rational foundation for their belief. After several painstaking hours of pointing out flaws in the proposed arguments, I would receive some form of the following comment: \u0027well, it really doesn\u0027t matter if these proofs are invalid, because I have faith in the exstence of god anyway.\u0027\nThe Theist who resorts to this approach has no claim to rationality- only lack of integrity.\" Smith\u0027s frustration throughout the text at this type of intrangisence is palpable and, ultimately, entirely understandable.\n\nSome of the reviews on this page are illustrative of the general resentment which most Christians seemed to hold for the methods by which human beings acquire knowledge and distinguish truth from falsehood. As an outspoken Atheist, I have heard these types of decrees repeated to me ad nauseum- and they never stop being disturbing. \"Lean not on your own understanding,\" I have been told again and again. \"Trust in the lord and stop using all this silly logic,\" or \"god wants us to believe like children,\" they will say.\n\nAll I hear is: \"I am happy being ignorant. You will be happy in this delusional fantasy land I live in, too. I know god is not just an inadequate answer to these questions, but no answer at all. Things don\u0027t need answers, or explanations, or anything. Everything is ok because I have faith in god.\"\n\nHence, I sympathize with Smith\u0027s frustration. I urge all Atheists to read this book, which reads more or less like a conversation between an atheist and an extremely intellectual and sophisticad christian who spews (practically)every argument ever conjured to be a believer or to be a Christian, and has them overwhelmingly refuted. Smith understands the obstanince that Atheists will inevitably encounter when Christians (particularly unsophisticated Christians) are challenged. This is probably the reason why some of his repudiations seem unnecessarily expatiated. Any atheist who has offered apologetics in defense of atheism knows that trying to engage a christian is like playing Whack-a-mole, as soon as one battle is definitvely won the Christian will retreat into a sheild of ignorance. This act, Smith accurately points out, will usually involve the word \"faith\" being substituted for, but meaning the exact same thing as, \"ignorance.\" I assume this is why SMith so meticulously tears apart the idea of something that human beings call \"faith\" being an effective(or even theoretically plausible) conduit to fundamental truth. He also points out the common ways that Christians like William Lane Craig and J.P. Moreland use mangled science or language to misrepresent the issues at hand.\n\nAs a small example of this that I found interesting, in \"Does God Exist?,\" J.P. Moreland states that he believes that people can actually perceive god through something he calls \"Numinous Perception.\" Moreland does not give an explanation of how an outside observer could ever deiscern whether someone was having a genuine \"Numinous perceptive\" experience, or how exactly numinous perception would actually work physiologically or psychologically. Conveniently, this would rule out any chance of Moreland\u0027s hypothesis ever being tested and shown to be accurate or inaccurate. When someone hears an argument like this, one can easily turn to Smith for excellent articulation of why they are absurd and illegitimate. \n\nSmith writes: \" My argument with the Christian is that he claims to have experienced god, but he refuses to explain the process by which he, a physical organism, experienced this supernatural being. I won\u0027t limit him arbitrarily to the traditional five senses, but I will demand that he present evidence for his new perceptual powers. Has he discovered a new sense? Fine, then let him tell us about it so we can test it. No christian has ever succeeded in explaining just how he perceives his mysterious god. He claims to have knowledge of a mysterious, unknowable being, having gained this knowledge in some mysterious unknowable manner. This is totally unacceptable.\"\n\nMoreland\u0027s clever creation of a scientific sounding title for perception of god does not help him.\n\nThis book will help atheists with this type of argumentation through just about any thread of thought a theological argument can get into.\n\nYes, the rhetoric 30 years later SOUNDS more sophisticated (with other clever titles like \"intelligent design theory\"), but it is not ACTUALLY more compelling or sophisticated than when Aquinas wrote his five proofs or Russell challenged Copelston. I reccomend this book and I can\u0027t wait to read \"Why Atheism?\"\n\n(Just as a curious note, does anyone know if SMith actually debated people in public? If anyone knows of any transcriptions id love to read some, please let me know if you do. Clark00018@aol.com )\n",
    "\nGolding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies, especially in this novel and in The Inheritors (1955), on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology.  The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pig\u0027s head upon a stick stuck in the ground, a totem in the making perhaps, but seen by Golding as Beelzebub, the \"lord of the flies,\" the devil, a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.\n\nThe central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition, the will to power, and the primordial need to survive.  When Piggy\u0027s glasses, which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken, it signals the degeneration, the return to the wild in which, as Thomas Hobbes has it, there are \"No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\"\n\nThat a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful, or more exactly, as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless, the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times.  Should we, through nuclear warfare, a runaway greenhouse effect, sectarian violence on a global scale, or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization, regress to the state of savages, we have this warning.\n\nInstead of the noble savage, instead of a return to the Garden of Eden, instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe, Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy\u0027s school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare.  As in The Inheritors, Golding sees not the good in humans, but the viciousness.  In The Inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle Neanderthal, here we children become gangsters of the island, on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the God of the Old Testament.  I understand that Golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of R.M. Ballantyne\u0027s The Coral Island (1857), which I haven\u0027t read.\n\nClearly cruelty is one of Golding\u0027s main themes.  Left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization\u0027s justice, humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power.  The boys Ralph and Piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government, but are defeated by the brutality of Jack and his will to savagery.\n\nThe loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had, but of something superimposed upon them by civilization.  In reality, Golding is saying, there is no innocence in children, that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe.\n\nThis is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to.  But the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys.  As in all great works of literature, it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages, and invites our admiration.\n\nIt should be noted that Golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans, probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery, or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he didn\u0027t find the task palatable.  I am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel.  Not only are there no girls on the island, but the boys do not, at least overtly, involve themselves in sex.  We can see that Golding\u0027s artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually.  I wonder if postmodern psychology would agree.  Certainly Freud would not.\n\nBottom line: a great read, a terrific adventure, but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens, in other words, you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares\n",
    "\nA lot of these reviews say that they\u0027ve read this book and it\u0027s \"done wonders\" for them and everyone they\u0027ve recommended it to.  The book itself will not do wonders unless you work on the things Gawain suggests.  It\u0027s not a miracle cure-all book - it\u0027s about giving you the motivation to do something about your life instead of sitting back and watching the trail roll out behind you.  I read this book in college when I was going through a little bit of a rough patch, figuring out what I wanted, etc.  Now that I\u0027ve graduated and am slowly becoming wary of the corporate world, I need more positivity in my life so I\u0027m re-reading it in the hopes that I can zero in on my goals and start achieving them again.  I highly recommend it to those who are open-minded enough to give it a chance\n",
    "\nNot only a terrific portrait of Louis B. Mayer, but a wonderful history of Hollywood movie-making.  My caveat is the portrait of Dore Schary.  While Eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between Mayer and Thalberg, Eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the Mayer Schary conflict in the last part of the book, possibly to \"correct\" the view of Mayer the Monster and Schary the savior in earlier Mayer bios.  His portrait of Schary, a man I knew, bears no resemblance to that decent, fair minded, and gifted man.  It is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of Schary.  Eyman claims that Schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals, yet Schary in his post MGM days produced a successful musical, \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown.\"  Whatever good flims came from MGM during Schary\u0027s reign are dismissed as the work of others. He creates a portrait of Schary as a talentless hack, forgetting not only the good films Schary wrote in earlier days but the successful Broadway play he wrote about FDR, \"Sunrise at Campabello.\"  He writes that Schary only spoke of himself in retirement.  I knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends.  If he can get Schary so wrong, it forces me to question his other judgments.  Having said all that, I think this is a fine book, evoking old Hollywood with grace and style.   \n",

    "\nas soon as people see breton\u0027s name on a book, they immediately feel indignation and privately exclaim, \u0026quot;the dictator of surrealism!\u0026quot; what they don\u0027t seem to realize is that, despite being a flawed and somewhat ambivalent man, he probably had more passion in his pinky than they do in their entire body. \u0026quot;nadja\u0026quot; is simply one more delightful proof of breton\u0027s genius and his infallible flair for the surreal, the mysterious, the mystical, and everything that is profoundly divergent. in this tale of intrigue and obsession he travels the streets of paris with a ghostly, clearly insane young woman who calls herself nadja, which is the russian word for hope.  the most captivating parts of the novel are the bizarre and surreal conversations he has with her. even though he found her incredibly fascinating and almost an ethereal enigma, things start to turn sour between them and breton grows bored with her.  at the end of the novel, nadja is put into an asylum after the police are called because of her incessant screaming and apparently incoherent behavior, some of which suggested that she was living in a world of hallucinations and irrational fears.  we do know that nadja was a real woman and not by means some fictitious creation of breton\u0027s, and we also know that she came to a somewhat unfortunate end. it may be true that breton\u0027s behavior and attitude of indifference and deliberate ignorance about her truly wretched fate (she died of cancer, insane and completely alone) is indeed nothing to admire, but those who put too much emphasis on this admittedly accurate fact forget that while he may in a sense have betrayed her, he also made a truly admirable effort to make the world see nadja and those like her as no one has seen them before, and immortalized her in a book that is absolutely unforgettable and breathtakingly beautiful. breton was a profoundly hopeful and truly revolutionary figure who exhorted humanity, even while the second world war raged and reaped it\u0027s devastating results universally on all of mankind, to recognize the miraculous and wondrous nature of our very existence, however \u0027absurd\u0027 or meaningless some felt it to be after the horrendous events of the twentieth century. it is true that he occasionally goes over the top with his optimism, but his iron will and determination to fight \u0027miserabilism\u0027, the philosophical justification of human misery, at all costs can only call forth our admiration. his exaltation of the imagination as the highest of human faculties and the sole organ of man that will allow him to attain felicity seems to be verified by direct, concrete experience of life.  as we grow older and we come to realize that sensual pleasure is a big part of life but essentially empty and hollow, our inner lives (hopefully) become more vivid and we end up spending more and more time there. breton knows this and wants us to cultivate it to the highest degree possible. don\u0027t be fooled by the \u0027anti breton\u0027 rhetoric and take a dismissive attitude toward him, because you\u0027ll be missing out on some of the most fascinating books (to my mind) ever written\n",

    "\nNICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a significant Dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses. The protagonist\u0027s experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama, comic relief, political satire, class comedy, social criticism, and domestic farce, they allow Dickens the opportunity to portray, to the minutest nuance, an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics. The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens: a generic, virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate. Nicholas Nickleby has committed no fault and offenses, and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world, to be separated from the people he loves, and to be proscribed like a criminal. The more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life, the more profusely the novel accentuates Dickens\u0027 outrage at the cruelty and social injustice.\n\nWhen Nicholas Nickleby is left exiguous after his father\u0027s death, he turns to his hard-hearted uncle to solicit succor. But Ralph Nickleby, a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is, demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred, and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows. The man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed. It\u0027s not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains. He cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred. He might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in Squeers\u0027 Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, as an assistant master. \n\nThe cruelty of Squeers, who\u0027s coarse and ruffian behavior even at his best temper, Nicholas has been an unwilling witness. The filthy condition of the school and the bodily distortion of the boys impart in him a dismal feeling. The thought of being a helper and abettor of such squalid practice fills his with honest disgust and indignation. The cruelties descend upon helpless infancy fuel this rightful indignation in Nicholas, who interferes with the schoolmaster\u0027s flogging a boy named Smike and astonishes everyone in school.\n\nNot only does Ralph persuade Nicholas\u0027 family to renounce him for the atrocities to Squeers of which he is guilty, he also betrays his niece Kate into the company of some libertine men who are clients of his and who speak of her in a most casual, lecherous, ribald and vulgar terms. She is roused beyond all endurance by a profusion of compliments of which coarseness becomes humor and of which vulgarity softens down to the most charming eccentricity. The mutual hatred between uncle and nephew aggravates as Nicholas overhears conversations about his sister. The hidden feud further percolates to the surface and leads to a pitch to its malignity as he tries to rescue a girl from a marriage to which she has been impelled. \n\nAs the uncle insidiously hatches a scheme to retaliate against his nephew who has in every step of the way interceded and thwarted his plans for mercenary gains, Nicholas entwines with a cast of characters who are humorous, memorable, and true to life. Peripheral to his molding to become a gentleman are episodes of political satire, theatrical success, courtship, family farce, and chicanery. The most significant character is no doubt Smike, whom Nicholas saves from the hellish grip of the schoolmaster and has become his best friend. Nicholas\u0027 unfailing love and protectiveness toward the boy accentuates his being the novel\u0027s hero, whose domestic virtues, affections, compassion, and delicacy of feelings qualifies him to his later fortune and does him justice.\n\nNICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a flamboyantly exuberant work in which Dickens wreaks the tension of his social satire to a pitch. Details on the Yorkshire school offer such magnifying vision of the cruelty, filthiness, and despotism in the boarding schools. Nor does he spare the rogues and the greedy, whose squeamishness he sarcastically embellishes as a common honesty and whose pride as self-respect. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY also evokes the subtle problem of human nature in establishing boundary of one\u0027s remorse. Although Ralph might feel no remorse in his betraying his niece to the temptation of his libertine clients, he hates them for doing what he has expected them to do. \n\nIn a sense, Nicholas is seen as the unswerving force that is determined to right the wrong of the society. He tries to appeal to the compassion and humanity of those who have gone astray and to lead them to consider the innocent and the helpless. Nicholas might embody energy for radicalism and ambition to challenge social injustice; his ultimate goal is the recovery of his ancestral position in the social hierarchy. But in the effort to undertake the good deeds, he is influenced by no selfish or personal consideration but by pity for the people he helps and detestation and abhorrence of the heartless schemes.  In the same way he is determined to appeal to his uncle\u0027s humanity and not to wreak revenge on him. But Ralph\u0027s hatred for his nephew has been fed upon his own defeat, nourished on his interference with all his schemes. \n\nNICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a sober social commentary woven with social and domestic issues. Woven in one man\u0027s aspiration to restore family\u0027s ancestral dignity is Dickens\u0027 own musing, monologues, teachings on the soul, the life, and the moral. The discourse at times assumes a voice of despondency, sobriety and indignation.\n",

    "\nThe reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded. The conversations in the book are intelligent, the characters and dialogue are real, and the descriptions and settings are vivid. While the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon Yale and New Haven, it is sometimes hard to believe, especially given that the author has been a faculty member at Yale Law School for over twenty-years. This is not to say, however, that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate. Rather, they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university (Yale) and those that are not.\n\nIn short, I enjoyed this book because it kept me guessing and the pace was just right. This is not a read-it-in-one-day thriller that Grisham might come up with. Instead, this is a much more intellectual read. What I enjoyed most about the book are its insights into life itself. Carter uses fictional characters to explore the good and bad sides to marriage and family life, careers, law, and racism in this country. If you are willing to keep reading when the story seems slow and to learn and grow with the characters (especially Talcott), believe me, this book will reward you, and you\u0027ll be glad you read it\n",
    "\nAs a one-time practicing physicist (now just an \"arm-chair physicist\") and lifetime music lover, I have found this beautifully-written little book irresistible over the 17 years it has been in my library. In 1983, when the original hardcover edition came out, this book was given to me as a gift by  someone knowing my musical tastes, figuring that it would be the perfect  gift. It turned out to be, but for reasons that are largely  non-musical.\n\nAs an arm-chair scientist, I\u0027ve read and enjoyed more than a  few popularizations by well-known scientists over the years. These include  Richard Feynman with his wry humor in virtually everything he wrote (I  number myself among those physicists who \"cut their eye teeth\" on the  Feynman Lectures in Physics), Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Carl Sagan,  and even Brian Swimme. (The Swimme of \"A Walk Through Time\" goes down  easily, and covers much of the same ground that Thomas does, but in a quite  different way; the Swimme of \"The Universe is a Green Dragon\" is a much  harder sell for me due to its hard-pressed attempt to oversimplify.) But  for sheer elegance and poetry and breadth of scope, and for essays that  provoke thought on the part of the reader, none can hold a candle to  Thomas.\n\nEveryone who reads this little masterpiece will have his or her  favorites. Here are a few of mine:\n\nIn \"Things Unflattened by Science\" (an  essay on unaddressed and/or incomplete challenges that future scientists  might well undertake), a paragraph on how biologists might endeavor to  better understand what music is, and how it affects the human condition,  starting with a rather small-scale assignment to explain the effect of  Bach\u0027s \"The Art of Fugue\" on the human mind.\n\nIn \"Altruism\" (an essay on  the symbiotic interrelationships among species), how it is that such a  condition actually exists, and a challenge to future scientists to better  understand how our own species might become more altruistic (and adult)  than it presently is.\n\nIn \"The Attic of the Brain\" (a cautionary essay on  the risks of psychiatry, most importantly psychoanalysis, in terms of  performing \"total brain dumps\"), the need for all of us to carry around a  little clutter in our lives, as insurance against the chance that we might  inadvertently lose our ability to retrieve something truly important.\n\nIn  the title (and final) essay, another cautionary tale, this time on  thermonuclear weaponry, the most lucid description I\u0027ve ever read regarding  the true meaning of this music as envisioned by Gustav Mahler. In a few  brief but sublime paragraphs, Thomas has captured the essence of this  remarkable opus in a way that no musician (and that includes such  Mahlerites as Bernstein, Karajan, Klemperer, Rattle and Walter) ever had.  Until very recently, that is, with the release a few months back of a  staggering performance by Benjamin Zander, conductng the Philharmonia  Orchestra. But that is another topic, and another review.\n\nIn the  seventeen years since the initial publication of this book, quite a bit has  changed in our worldview, in some aspects of society and science. But not  enough! The observations and challenges that Thomas lays out will endure  for centuries, provided only that we endure as well.\n\nBob Zeidle\n",

    "\nThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. Shortly after it was accessible to the public, multiple committees banned the book, proclaiming it to be racist and \"trash\". To this day, Mark Twain\u0027s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts. \n\nIn my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert O\u0027Meally. He clearly states that the intent of Twain\u0027s word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. His usage of the racial slur \"nigger\" can be seen as offensive, but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character, time, and place, at which the slur was used casually. \n\nBesides the usage of the word \"nigger\", characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality.  In the begining of Chapter 14, Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics, both of them speaking their mind. Twain describes Huck\u0027s thoughts: \"Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger.\" Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude, yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life, the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate.\n\nI strongly support Mark Twain\u0027s the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book wins people over with it \u0027s dialogue, plot, originality, and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America.\n",

I subsequently have bought copies for my aged mother in another state, and for my fiance. I have to say, my fiance read it through and studied it like a how to manual for fixing me! (She\u0027s a little scary, sometimes!) And of course I sent a copy to my brother, the doctor, who has added it to his trusted library of resources and textbooks. \n\nI am now on one of the medications for the neurotransmitter stimulus. I have opted out of the antidepressants, because of their scary side effect warnings. But the stimulant works to calm me and flush me with something I don\u0027t have without the medication. It makes a difference. I feel better and more confident, more able to concentrate and more up to meeting all the challenges of life. What more can I say?  Their attention to all facets including proper medication and case history is fascinating, intriguing, and extremely useful. Hope is out there\n",

But I would like to say that I don\u0027t have much time for reading, so make sure the books I choose are those by authors I consider 5-star. J.D. Robb a/k/a Nora Roberts is one of the most prolific authors I\u0027ve ever read. How she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination. I\u0027ve read this series out of order, but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone. This one, however, revealed to me the reason behind Eve\u0027s sometimes belligerent attitude, her strong persona, and standoffishness. Robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts, inner turmoils.

    "\nSimon Winchester is a popular historian, in the modern mold. This means that he\u0027s socially and politically a liberal, and that he\u0027s interested in *everything* connected with a specific event. He\u0027ll examine it from all angles, and attempt to see it from everyone\u0027s eyes, look over everything connected with it, and then draw some conclusions. Usually, those conclusions over-reach some (I\u0027m being general about this type of writer, not of Winchester specifically) and the point of view is relentlessly modern.\n\nWinchester has chosen as the topic of this book the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in 1883. Interestingly, the author is trained as a geologist, though he has spent most of his life working as a journalist and writer. This means that he actually understands the terminology of geology and vulcanology enough that he can at least make an attempt to explain it to the rest of us in layman\u0027s terms, and the result is generally a happy one. Krakatoa was a complex event (the island had three summits, each a separate volcano: two disappeared in the explosion, but they erupted for a good while beforehand, and their effects lasted for years afterwards) and Winchester does a good job of relating what happened, the prelude to it, and the aftermath.\n\nThe one criticism that people have which I agree with is that he tends to wander a bit, at times. There are discussions here of everything from Dutch Colonial policy to the habits of spiders to rather technical (though carefully explained) geology. While it\u0027s all interesting, sometimes it does stray a bit far from the chosen topic. The author also occasionally over-reaches, a bit. For instance, his assertion that the explosion of the volcano indirectly led to Indonesia\u0027s independance is a bit much. My edition included a magazine article he\u0027d written just after the Boxing Day tsunami, in which he attempts to connect the San Francisco earthquake with George W. Bush\u0027s election as U.S. President...that seems and even bigger stretch, to be honest.\n\nWhen the author sticks to the story, however, what he writes is very interesting. I would recommend this book\n",
    "\nThis is truely a funny book.  It of course is the origin of the Ma and Pa Kettle movies, yet much more.  I like to pull this one off the shelf every now and again just to be able to chuckle.  When you read it, you must remember when it was written and what the racial and political attitudes of the time were, although,  it is a good read on that level too, i.e. seeing were our culture has been and where it is today.  I did read one or two reviews which compaired this work to some of the authors other work...good grief folks, lighten up..read the thing for what it is..a funny story meant to amuse. When I was a kid, I did not read Micky Mouse and analyze each comic book for political correctness, nor social commentary (although, being a dog lover, I was not always happy how Pluto was presented and treated) nor did I compair the Micky of 1949 to the Micky of 1952.  Anyway, digging into a book like this for those reasons is fine I suppose, if you are into such, but for me, I just enjoyed the read and highly recommend it\n",
    "\n\nGeorge DeWolfe sees the photographer as an artist, not a technician, yet his book provides the technical knowledge and shows how to use Photoshop to create consistently high quality fine art prints.  Writing for the experienced photographer with a basic knowledge of Photoshop, DeWolfe begins by showing the photographer, with many examples, how to evaluate an image and decide what adjustments will bring out its special qualities.  The experienced photographer has always used his or her understanding of how light, luminosity and color give life to an image, and has traditionally used various techniques in the darkroom to enhance them.  DeWolfe begins by training the eye of the artist to see these elements and understand how they work.  After showing the reader how to truly see the image and decide how to fine-tune it, DeWolfe then gives us a very detailed digital workflow which, once mastered, allows the photographer to produce excellent prints on a consistent basis. The workflow is clarified by many screen shots showing Photoshop techniques and before/after image adjustments. Those who think visually will find these particularly helpful.\n\nDeWolfe\u0027s approach is to use the simplest techniques that can produce consistently fine results.  (Some Photoshop users will be surprised by his use of the history brush instead of masking; as a photographer who uses this tool, I appreciate its simplicity and controlled results.)  His focus is not on \"tips-and-tricks in Photoshop\", but on how to get the best possible prints in the simplest, most straightforward way.  While a first reading gives valuable insights, the book\u0027s true value becomes evident when the photographer uses the workflow on his or her own images, and practices to become proficient.  The proof, as they say, is in the print\n",

The drawings are all bold and enjoyable ranging from a pattern of high-heeled shoes or little kisses to a close-up of a very Warhol-esque face. At the top of each sheet, there are little quotes of Andy\u0027s relating to fashion. Very cool for maintaining the overall theme, I think.

    "\nCitizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man, Thorby, as he matures from boy to man. Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar, Baslim, we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom, though we see that in fact \u0027slaves\u0027 sometimes have more freedom of choice than \u0027free men\u0027. The society he paints here is vivid and believable (though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me). Baslim is far more than he appears to be, and puts Thorby through a rigorous education, both academic and practical. How do you become a really good beggar? Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability, from begging to juggling. Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums. These are items that may pass over young readers\u0027 heads, but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined, nothing should be accepted on \u0027faith\u0027, that personal integrity is more important than \u0027success\u0027, that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action. \n\nLater, Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders, a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture. Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom: a person\u0027s ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives. The Free Trader society (which owes much to Margaret Mead\u0027s seminal ideas, and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security, peace of mind, and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads, but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice. This section of the book may be the best part, as the society is so different from today\u0027s American culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right, apart from its effects on Thorby. Thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book, from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires.  \n\nThe last section deals with Thorby back on Earth, within a society not much different from our own, and shows a third aspect of freedom: the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them. Freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces. As this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society (though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic/lawyer dominated one), it isn\u0027t as engrossing as the first two sections, but is highly important in terms of completing Heinlein\u0027s thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom.\n\nCharacterization other than Thorby and Baslim is pretty thin, especially for the females that appear in supporting roles. This was fairly typical for his juveniles, as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character. But the thematic line on slavery/freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books, and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works (most especially Farnham\u0027s Freehold), has to be seen as one of Heinlein\u0027s personal beliefs (unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate).  \n\nThis book is not Heinlein\u0027s absolute best, nor even the best of his so-called \u0027juveniles\u0027 (which are typically better reading than most \u0027adult\u0027 mainstream bestsellers), but still provides an engrossing, fun, and illuminating read. Recommended for all readers willing to look at life styles different from their own.\n\n--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)\n",
    "\nWritten all the way back in the mid-1980s, long before all the heated rhetoric about illegal immigration going on in the US today, this book has turned out to be amazingly prescient. I feel like I would have had a much better understanding of this subject (not to mention appreciation of the people involved) had I discovered it a long time ago, but I suppose late is better than never.\n\nTed Conover did what I don\u0027t imagine very many other Americans would have the courage to do: Cross illegally from Mexico into the US with Mexicans doing the same thing. In doing so, he gives readers incredible insight into what compels some Mexicans to make that journey (i.e what life is like where they come from), what the journey is like, and what awaits them on this side of the border. I found myself exceedingly grateful for having been born American and simply in awe of the Mexicans who live such vastly disparate lives from their privileged neighbors to the north.\n\nConover simply relates his experiences to readers without the kind of  ideological commentary or other editorializing that can get in the way of the facts surrounding the contentious issues involved. Coyotes is a well-written, touching, informative, and inspiring book that should be required reading for all Americans before they open their mouths about illegal immigration\n",

    "\nMany people remember the battle of Midway as the turning point of the war in the Pacific due to the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers, and rightly so.  But would the American success at Midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons?  Probably not.  In this eye-opening account of the battle, author Alvin Kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who, flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes, cleared the way for the SBD Dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the Japanese carriers.\n\nAfter sighting the enemy carriers, the three American flattops began launching their torpedo bombers, dive bombers, and fighters in the hopes of making a coordinated attack on the Japanese fleet.  However, while en route to the target, almost all of the squadrons became separated and the USS Hornet\u0027s contingent of fighters and dive bombers never even made it to the Japanese fleet. Its aircraft either returned to the carrier or ditched in the sea.  Meanwhile, ,the planes from USS Yorktown and USS Enterprise were not able to coordinate their attacks.  Thus, the torpedo planes attacked without fighter protection.\n\nThese planes were thrown into a virtual meat grinder of anti aircraft fire and pursuit from Japanese fighters.  Out of a compliment of 51 planes, 44 were shot down.  One man, Ensign George Gay, survived from Torpedo squadron 8.  Not a single American torpedo hit the Japanese fleet.  However, this sacrifice was not in vain, for a few minutes later, the SBDs found the Japanese and in the span of a few minutes sent three Japanese carriers to the bottom.  The fourth followed later in the day.\n\nThe author brings up some interesting points in the book.  For example, he mentions the confusing flight plan of the Hornet\u0027s commander Ring, who, for some reason, chose to fly a course which would take him well north of the Japanese fleet.  He then failed to write an after action report upon returning to the Hornet.  The author also describes the inferiority of the American aircraft, specifically, there extremely limited range which, in the end, caused the American fighters to turn back.  Also, the fighters that did make it to the Japanese fleet never flew down to help out the lumbering Devastators.  In all intents and purposes, the SBDs happened to end up in the right place at precisely the right time.  If they had not, the battle could have turned out much differently.\n\nThis is a fascinating book.  I\u0027ve read several books about the battle of Midway, but none have went into the depth of exploring the destruction of the torpedo planes as this one does.  The writer, a former member of the Enterprise\u0027s air group, describes the battle as only a true eyewitness could.  He raises some alarming quetions which I had never thought about before reading this book.  Although the book itself is somewhat short, it does a masterful job of covering the plight of the torpedo planes.\n\nI highly recommend this fine book.  If you\u0027ve read anything previously about the battle of Midway, you must read this book.  It sheds some new light on the heroic sacrifice of the American torpedo squadrons and how their actions paved the way for the American victory\n",

I look at it this way:  Spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10.00 for a resistance rope - PLUS - you get to do this in the privacy of your home.  This is a great idea, especially for women that have children, a job and the home to contend with.  \n\nJim Karas was overweight for several years.  He can relate to me.  He revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because I simply cannot handle cardio workouts due to a bad back.  The running and \"stepping\" in cardio is too much for me.  \n\nThis is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience\n",

    "\nOh, Spike in San Antonio. It\u0027s so hard to believe that sexism exists, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m not sure where your numbers come from, as your logic seems tenuous, at best, but according to that left-wing, liberal think tank known as the US Census Bureau, Rowe-Finkbeiner is right. And it\u0027s getting worse. \n\nThe Census Bureau reported in August, based on the Current Population Survey, that women\u0027s  real median earnings fell by $171, or 0.6 percent, from 2002 to 2003, while men\u0027s increased by  $336, or 0.8 percent. (The increase for men was not statistically significant, but the decrease for women was.) The gender wage ratio thus fell to 75.5, compared with 76.6 in 2002. In addition, a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in October of 2003, controlling for changes in education and work experience over time, concludes that womens earnings have  remained stagnant, relative to men\u0027s, for an even longer period--17 years--with a gap that cannot be explained by measurable differences in education and experience.\n\nIf you actually read The F-Word, you might find  cited cases like this: Although women make up nearly 3/4 of Wal-Mart\u0027s workforce, men hold 90% of management positions--despite female employee\u0027s receiving better performance evaluations overall--and female employees are paid lower wages than male employees for the same jobs. None of this is disputed by the corporation. Why? According to Wal-Mart, because men are there for a career, while women are working for pocket money. I wish I could say your attitude was merely naive--but the truth is it\u0027s far more dangerous and insidious. Thanks to Rowe-Finbeiner for telling it how it really is. \n\n   \n",

    "\nKenneth Pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of Iran from the rise of the Persian Empire to the reign of the Pahlavis (pp. 3-100).  Pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic Iran got wary of meddling foreigners, starting with the hated Russians and Brits, in its domestic affairs (pp. 4, 41).  Many Iranians have angry psychological scars, believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons (pp. 26, 71, 89, 99, 125, 128, 155-56, 161, 173-74, 242, 297, 389).  \n\nPollack focuses the bulk of his book on a balanced account of the troubled American-Iranian relations in the last 50+ years.  The U.S. started building its \"satanic\" reputation after the CIA played a key role in helping the Brits get rid of Iran\u0027s popular Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 (pp. 57-67).  Mosaddeq\u0027s \"crime\" was the \"illegal\" nationalization of the Iranian oil industry under control of the rapacious Brits (pp. 52-56).  The U.S. did not improve its reputation among most Iranians by supporting the dictatorial Shah who largely mismanaged the modernization of Iran until his overthrow in 1979 (pp. xxv, 72-140).  \n\nPollack convincingly demonstrates that the Truman Administration and its successors usually did not exercise enough pressure on the Shah to democratize and liberalize Iran when they had the opportunity to do it (pp. 49, 76-77, 81, 89-90, 104, 121-24, 136-40).  The Shah, who was ironically considered sold out to the West, became less and less amenable to the \"omniscient\" U.S., beginning in the mid-1960s (pp. 39, 50, 84, 94, 99-100, 107, 120-27, 158, 173).   \n\nAfter the revolution of 1979, the U.S. mostly supported Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and funded different destabilization operations to contain and try to overthrow the Islamic Republic (pp. 206-16, 259-65, 273-76, 386).  The U.S. apologized in 2000 for some past misdeeds in an unsuccessful attempt to improve its relations with Teheran under the presidency of the moderate but ultimately ineffective Mohammad Kathami, who was under relentless pressure from the hard-liners (pp. xxv, 303-42). \n\nPollack blames with equal conviction the Iranians for the awful relations existing between both countries.  Iran has built its reputation of international pariah due to the illegal seizure of the U.S. embassy staff in 1979, its lack of democratic credentials, its support of terrorism around the world, its opposition to the Middle East peace process, and its pursuit of (nuclear) WMDs (pp. xxi, 141-80, 182, 198-201, 237-40, 248, 256-59, 266-67, 277, 345, 379-82).   Pollack also explains to its readers that many Iranians have a poor understanding of the U.S. (pp. 50, 180, 309).   \n\nPollack does not hesitate to show repeatedly that greed has not stopped the international community, including the U.S. at times, from doing business with Iran in the last 25+ years (pp. 164-65, 262-65, 271-72, 286-89).  Iran is trying without much success to emulate China by crushing internal dissent and favoring economic development (pp. xxiv, 250, 369-73, 390-91).  The U.S. will be of no help in this endeavor as long as Iran stubbornly clings to its pursuit of acquiring nuclear military expertise on top of other objectionable actions (pp. 273, 312, 324, 351). \n\nPollack tries to crack the Iranian enigma by rightly ruling out an invasion of Iran due to its size, population, and topography (pp. xxiii, 383-86).  Pollack ultimately pleads for a three-pronged strategy that rests on an unconvincing mix of carrots and sticks (pp. 375-424). \n\nThe U.S.-led international community seems to believe that Iran will \"submit\" to the \"diktats\" of foreigners in the nuclear crisis without undermining again the \"legitimacy\" of the hard-liners (pp. xxv-xxvi, 157, 251, 352, 365, 395-400).  Hard-liners have not forgotten the humiliation of 1988 (pp. 227-33).  Nuclear WMDs would shield Iran from further \"humiliating\" foreign interference (pp. 259, 361-69).\n\nThe Shi\u0027i hard-liners, inspired by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and co, relish martyrdom and heavy sacrifices (pp. 157, 177-79, 222-23, 302).  Like most of his predecessors, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is seeking confrontation with the international community as a way of diverting Iranians\u0027 attention from their problems for which ideology is a poor solution (pp. 158, 238, 243, 293-96, 348, 369-74).  Iranian hard-liners can find plenty of inspiration in the playbooks of Adolf Hitler and co.\n\nThe U.S. will discover again at its own expense that key countries will balk at acting responsibly after Iran predictably fails to comply with the legitimate demands of the society of nations (pp. 165, 262).  Iranian hard-liners consider weakness a defensive and reactive policy towards their offensive agenda (pp. 218, 234-35, 266, 300).  Nothing meaningful will happen until the implementation of very comprehensive economic / financial sanctions and the credible threat of massive strategic bombardments against the nuclear and revolutionary power infrastructure across Iran (pp. 299, 301, 392-95).  Iran has not been impressed with half-baked carrots like the Critical Dialogue and, with \"Mini-Me\" sticks such as Dual Containment and a few cruise missiles (pp. 265, 273-76, 283-84, 291, 337-38, 344, 391).\n\nThere will be no free lunch (p. 385).  Stepped-up war against (state-sponsored) terrorism will require a series of \"patriotic\" sacrifices to mitigate the inevitable, short-term sharp increase in energy prices.  Furthermore, there will be a new spike in terrorist operations as a \"payback\" for muscular action against Iran (pp. 253, 345-49, 354-58, 373, 392).\n\nIf Iran is not stopped before it acquires nuclear WMDs, it will indulge with a vengeance its own regional hegemonic aspirations not only in the Persian Gulf, but also in Central Asia (pp. 253-56).  Energy prices will not go down in this scenario.  Furthermore, Iranian hard-liners could consider Southern Russia and Chinese Xinjiang fair game for their revolutionary agenda due to the sub-optimal treatment of many Muslim minorities in these areas (pp. 198-205).  Their military nuclear program is not purely defensive.  Whoever ignores the past, will pay a heavy price down the road.\n",

    "\n\"Lords of the Earth\" is the term the Yali warriors use to describe themselves.  They live in the Heluk valley in Irian Jaya, and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains.  The first section of the book is about them, their customs, and the awful fear and darkness they lived in.  Don Richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin, and longing for release.  The horror of their pain is graphic, and not suitable to be read to younger children.  \n\nThe second part of the book describes the early life of Stan Dale, his conversion, and his burden for those in darkness.  He is drawn as a determined man, physically strong and fit, with firm convictions.  \n\nThe book goes on to tell of Stan\u0027s coming to the Yali people.  How a strange story begins over his identity, protecting his life.  How the first few Yali Christians were killed, and later Stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered.  How another missionary family died in a plane crash, except for the nine-year-old son, whose friendship with the Yali paves the way for them to turn to Christ.  \n\nThe book reminded me Christ\u0027s words in John 12:24, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\"  On earth, Stan Dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth, but he will rejoice in heaven with the Yali that are there through his witness.  \n",
    "\nReading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking, which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. The first time that I read it, I read it as a novel, for entertainment. Years later, I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.  During this second reading, I was able to examine the Russian names, characters, events, and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog, which I scanted then but studied now. Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going, which it certainly is, but in it, Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do. In essence, each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space, with one atom colliding at random with another, but when a sufficient number act in concert, such as Napoleon\u0027s invasion of Russia, their force is irresistable. When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar, he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom, who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can.  The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change.  But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms, then they are drawing closer to a universal \"one\" with nature.  This \"one\" Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God. Tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that \"one\" or any other deity, but he does say that history, time, and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path, and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go, then he might wish to emulate General Kutuzov, who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going. \n",
    "\nAdd this reviewer to the list of people who hold Paradise Lost up to the lofty title of The Greatest Epic Poem in the English Language; it is not only this, but one of the best in any language. Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse, Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer, Virgil, and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work. The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer, as are other elements, but Milton has a very unique poetic style; long sentences, often with the principle verb at the end, being one of its mainstays. This language is very grandiose and quite complex; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but, as with most classical literature, once the reader gets the hang of it, it goes quite smoothly. The Divine Comedy of Dante has a more towring reputation than does Milton\u0027s Paradise Lost -- for one thing, it is older -- but I among those who find Milton to be superior. The Divine Comedy is, certainly, an undisputed masterpiece, but, where it was, more or less, a satire and a thinly-veiled attack on many of Dante\u0027s political enemies, Milton\u0027s work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter:  why mankind fell, how the gods themselves operate and think, the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin, the importance of love in human relationships, the moral problems of God\u0027s justice. It is true that Dante\u0027s work is more original; Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, at least in seed, come straight from The Bible. But Milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath. Milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the Christian tradition, to be sure, but far from fundamentalist, and even quite radical for its day. Although some cite the work as Christian apologist, there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard-line Christians would be taken aback by; it was, of course, even more controversial in its day. One thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that Satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than God. This, in my view, does not have Milton unwittingly on the Devil\u0027s side, as some critics have suggested. Rather, he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is:  of course it\u0027s interesting, of course it\u0027s appealing -- otherwise, we wouldn\u0027t keep falling for it again and again and again. If we saw its razor-sharp fangs and [dripping] mouth, we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago. However, as a non-Christian myself, I cannot but disagree with some points of Milton\u0027s theodicy; the last two books, in particular, and Paradise Regained as a whole, were, for me, quite hard to swallow. I found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing. Milton paints Adam and Eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share:  joy, happiness, fear, sadness, depression, and, most of all, the overriding paramount importance of love. The act of Adam, who was not himself [evil], eating of the apple so that he could follow Eve, no matter what doom was to befall her and them, out of love for her, is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature -- as Mark Twain, in the voice of Adam, later said, \"Wheresoever Eve was there, THERE was Eden.\" God, Satan, and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics; most Christians today seem to have forgotten that God created Man \"in His own image\", and that He is not a perfect creature. Likewise, Satan is not entirely evil -- certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic, but so are many humans -- indeed, many have seen him as the hero of the poem (an errorenous view, as I see it.) God often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful; indeed, to many readers, myself included, this poem doesn\u0027t come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of Gods to men, but only reinforces the views we already had (Mark Twain, whom I have previously mentioned, has a very different view of the situation, closer to my own perspective, that is worth seeking out.) Whatever one\u0027s objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem, the poem remains a great work of literature -- poetic, grandiose, profound, extremely readable, and thought-provoking. The shorter sequel, Paradise Regained, is also included in this edition. This work, in my view, comes nowhere near the glory of it\u0027s predecessor, but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well. For that reason, I highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works; also because the introduction, written by Dr. Susanne Woods, is very good, and it has notes provided by the wonderful Christoper Ricks, who also edited the poem for this version. Unlike many editors, he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text:  they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them. This is an absolute classic not only of English literature, but of world literature, and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read\n",

    "\nWhitman is not the world\u0027s greatest poet - that\u0027s probably Shakespeare - but he\u0027s certainly been the most influential American poetic voice over the past century. He was the first poet to take all of American life as his subject. Ever the Romantic, Whitman was also the first poet to bring Romanticism into line with everyday reality.\n\nHis narcissism can be annoying, but his panoramic descriptions of life and the imagination have a singularly cumulative power.  Some of his short poems (\"A Noiseless Patient Spider\" and \"To a Locomotive in Winter\")are individually memorable. The longer poem \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed,\" indirectly about the Lincoln assassination, is brilliant. I think most of his Civil War poems are overpraised, but \"Come Up from the Fields, Father\" is a masterpiece of its kind.\n\nOn the negative side, Whitman\u0027s transcendental philosophy, which he likes to indulge at length, will strike many readers as very sappy.  His style, lots of details piled up on top of one another, grows monotonous, and readers who criticize his lack of traditional poetic craftsmanship cannot just be brushed off. My advice is to not to try to get through it all at once. The poems rarely become \"difficult,\" they just tend to blur one into the other. Which may actually have been Whitman\u0027s intention.\n\nOverall,there\u0027s never been a book quite like \"Leaves of Grass,\" in any edition, and that\u0027s why it keeps selling as a true classic.

    "\nOs Guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply.  This book is no exception.  The fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section. \n\nOne of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays, all around the central theme of the importance of character.  While our culture often acts to create an \"end justifies the means\" behavioral set, never before has character been so important, or so difficult to really practice and live.\n\nThe book begins with some essays from famous leaders; from Plato to George Washington, Winston Churchill to Machiavelli, and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character, and how it was to be demonstrated.  Much of the material is pretty well known, yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort. \n\nMy favorite sections were on the \"Cultural Erosions of Character\" in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all.  From advertising, to media, the pressure to conform is greater than ever, but in some ways has always existed.  \n\nOne of the best essay\u0027s in my opinion is called the \"Revenge of Failure\" wherein Henry Fairlie rips the \"legend of our times\", as envy at its worst.  No longer content to envy what others have and we do not, we now attempt to destroy in others that which we cannot achieve ourselves.  This process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to \"buy\" our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable, but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable.  Thus character becomes something that is no longer \"earned\".\n\nThe sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character.  In this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection, the hunter becomes the hunted, and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance.   Powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance, are depicted with a convicting clarity.\n\nOverall, this is a very well done and thought provoking book.  As a study guide it would be ideal for small groups, or even personal reflections.  The book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once, or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness.  Highly recommended.\n\n",

    "\nRead on if you are:\n\n- Used to PHP programming, but not a very sophisticated programmer.\n- Looking out to do more programming on a higher level.\n- Ready to read through book texts three times and to read further material that is not included in the book you buy.\n\nSchlossnagle\u0027s book is not written along one red line, it covers various topics and allows jumping around quite freely. However, the topics that it covers are highly efficient in helping you advance with your programming skills. They might not quite be what you\u0027d expect from a PHP book, because actually Schlossnagle covers  anything that is needed to work with PHP on a professional level.\nConsider this list of topics:\n\n- Write clean code\n- OO-Design Patterns\n- Project documentation\n- Performance tunings\n\nThis is all not really PHP-only stuff, but it is a great source of inspiration and furthers the understanding of programming in general very much. The latter I find is necessary for everybody who\u0027s up to something bigger in PHP.\n\nThe PHP examples in the book are - I have to admit - maybe sometimes rather scarce. One would like to see more applications of abstract problems, more examples. But is that what a book is for, to give examples?\nI don\u0027t think so. For me a book is mainly a source of great ideas from great programmers, anything else is available on the web.\n\nAfter having bought \"Advanced PHP Programming\" I purchased other books, the topics of which I would not have considered without reading Schlossnagle\u0027s work.

    "\nFor most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate \"companion\" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross\u0027s classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman\u0027s case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross\u0027s overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together.   \n\n\n",
    "\nI enjoyed Robert Webber\u0027s book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well. At a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the \"fate\" of the church in America. So much \"commodification\" has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be \"ecclesia\"? Although I agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which Webber received his doctorate from), my question is are we truly called to \"change\" the church in order to meet the people where they are at? \nI agree with his assessments yet I question the reasonings behind doing it. Do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others, just because the culture would be more \"prone\" to come to the church? Or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture? \nOur self-centered culture always asks the question \"What does this mean for me?\", and this has been a active question in the church for sometime. I believe the question that we should be asking is how does God give meaning to me, or what do I mean to God? Our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the Lord of the cosmos\n",

He covers the buccaneer lifestyle on land as well as at sea, the events leading up to their rise in influence in the Caribbean, and goes into clothing, food, religion, heirarchy, weapons, flags,choice of ships and cultural relationships.\nI picked up this book primarily to confirm or disprove my theories on individual weapons combat during boarding actions and while the techniques are not played up in any great detail,citing the use of powder and grenades over cutlass and knife, the reasonings behind what weapons were used and how unorthodox hand to hand combat could be in closed quarters are sound.\nOverall a very enjoyable and informative book!\n\nGareth Thomas\nDirector; Historical Maritime Combat Associatio\n",
    "\nWith the hype over the Da Vinci Code and its related popularity, you can sometimes get the feeling that some people probably think the grand conspiracy novel started with Dan Brown.  Of course, this is not the case, as Brown is merely one in a long line of such thriller writers.  Probably the biggest in the bunch was Robert Ludlum, but not to be forgotten is Jon Land.  Not quite the big name that Ludlum or Brown, Land is nonetheless the most pure fun, with outlandish plots and tons of action.\n\nThe Last Prophecy brings back Danielle Barnea, an ex-Israeli cop and Ben Kamal, a former Palestinian detective.  Despite the obvious conflicts caused by their different backgrounds, the two are faithful lovers and, as the novel begins, both working as investigators for the U.N.  In this case, the two are called to look into a mass murder in a Palestinian village.  At first, it appears to be a massacre by Israeli troops, but it soon enough appears to be something far more sinister, a conspiracy tied to events uncovered at the World War II and some lost prophecies of Nostradamus.  The last of these prophecies provides the key to the conspiracy.\n\nLand uses his standard formula for his Barnea/Kamal novels:  the two split up for the majority of the book to separately unearth parts of the plot only to converge at the end to stop the bad guys.  Typically, the people who provide the information are assassinated by the villains before they can reveal all.  This formula works well enough since Land executes it well (and really, Brown and Ludlum use a similar formula themselves).\n\nI won\u0027t say this is perfect writing, but it\u0027s plenty good enough to merit a strong four stars.  My biggest \"problem\" with Land is that he is only writing books featuring Barnea and Kamal; I miss his older novels with Blaine McCracken, which were even more delightfully outlandish with their James Bond-like world conquest plots.  But in the absence of McCracken, this series still fits the bill for what Land does best: entertain from beginning to end.\n",

    "\nNote to reviewers - the title of the book was a play on Hillary claiming that there was a \"vast right wing conspiracy\" against her husband in the Monica scandal - she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy (right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything).\n\nThis is an excellent non-polemical book that sets out the steps taken by the left to unseat Bush. I watched from Canada and monthly visits to the US (business) and the book accurately reflects what was going on (rightly or wrongly) at the time. \n\nIt describes how a loose linkage of the media, Hollywood, pop stars, MoveOn.org (Soros), academia, Kerry spinmeisters and the intelligentsia on the left and right coasts self organized to bring down Bush and the GOP.\n\nIt is a good read and ties together many of the disparate threads into a reasonably accurate picture. Perhaps the book can be faulted - hence only 4 stars - because there certainly was strident activity on the right too. Limbaugh, Hannity and O\u0027Reilly, of course, doing their thing although not with the power of the mainstream media and Hollywood behind them.\n\nFor me the interesting theme he points out is the self organizing nature of the endeavour driven by an almost irrational loathing of Bush.  Recall many Hollywood gliterrati threatening to move to Canada if Bush was elected. \n\nI\u0027m editorializing here - but it does seem strange that some reviewers - notably one from the UK - use this site as a platform for gross anti-US, anti-Bush remarks rather than taking the time to actually critique the book in question\n",

    "\n\nRabbi Harold S. Kushner is one of the best known authors of our time, having written the classic book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People.  This, his ninth book, was one of the top ten best selling religious books of the past year.  As the title indicates, it is a study of Psalm 23, certainly the most beloved of all of the Psalms.  Dr. Kushner writes with a pastor\u0027s heart and a special eye toward the healing wisdom to be found in that portion of God\u0027s Word.\n\nIf you are looking for a book about putting your spiritual life into meaningful practice, you might wish to read this book.  It is filled with inspiration and encouragement for an ongoing trusting relationship with God.  Kushner takes each phrase of the Psalm as his chapter headings, and verse by verse, provides insight and practical suggestions for how to make these truths come alive each day.\n\nThroughout the book, Kushner utilizes his vast knowledge of the original Hebrew text to help the reader understand the nuances of the words such as \"soul\" and \"cup\".  He explains the nuances of what the soul is and why the soul needs nourishing.  He states, \"The world asks so much of us.  We give ourselves so totally to our work, to the task of raising our family and running a home that we often forget to take time to nourish our souls...\" (page 61).\n\nThe fact that God helps us \"feel safe in an unsafe world\" (page 50) is the Psalmist\u0027s theme, repeated and emphasized in every line.  Drawing from the world of science and literature, art and great works of theology, this deceptively small book is filled with encouragement and blessing.\n\nOccasionally, Christians forgo reading Jewish authors, forgetting that Judaism is the forerunner of our own faith in Jesus Christ.  That would be a mistake.  For, here, we have a work that is sacred to both of our traditions, presented by an acclaimed author, dedicated scholar and proven congregational leader.  Dr. Kushner is Rabbi Laureate of Temple Israel in Natick, Massachusetts.  He has been honored by the Christophers as one of fifty people who have made the world a better place and by Religion in American Life as their Clergyman of the Year in 1999.  This is a book to read, give and savor over time.\n\nIf you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.\n",
    "\nI have long been aware of the commercial success of author Nora Roberts but the storylines and writing style (a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance) have never tempted me to read any of her work. However, I happened to pick up a copy of volume #21 (depending on how you count anthology inclusions) in the .... IN DEATH series written under the pen name J.D. Robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series (the year is 2058) with a strong central character (Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas) who had a continuing romantic interest (the mysterious Irish billionaire Roarke). I have long enjoyed the Spenser series by Robert Parker and the ensemble cast of Ed McBain\u0027s 87th Precinct novels; the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of New York City, an area very familiar to me. I was immediately hooked by SURVIVOR IN DEATH and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review (3/30/2005). I read ORIGIN IN DEATH, the next book in the series, as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well (7/26/2005). As with other series which I have enjoyed, I then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved. \n\nIn my opinion, the early stories in the series can best be labeled transition novels as romance author Roberts attempts to transform herself into mystery writer Robb. My recent three star review (11/29/2005) of NAKED IN DEATH, the initial book in the series, discusses the specific positives and negatives of that attempt, so I will not go into detail again here. And in summary, I found this book a much better police procedural although with the major flaw that it seemed a little too obvious that Eve\u0027s pursuit of her initial suspect (although logical) would turn out to be a diversion from her identification of the real killer. I so greatly enjoyed Susan Ericksen\u0027s audio rendition (unabridged CD) of that book that I also chose to listen to the audio version of this novel; I highly recommend her narration as likely to add to your enjoyment of the story. \n\nA wonderfully apt Dryden quotation concerning fame and death opens this story; then Lt. Eve Dallas is discovered at the scene of a shocking homicide. Prosecuting Attorney Cicely Towers, a powerful and widely recognized star in the District attorney\u0027s office and a woman with whom Eve has dealt on occasion, has been found with her throat brutally slashed in a nasty neighborhood far from her office and her home late one night. The final appointment in her datebook is for an earlier dinner with her good friend and long time lover George Hammett; Eve quickly establishes that she arrived safely home and subsequently received a mystery call of which she made no record but which obviously drew her to the scene of her death. Eve\u0027s investigation is complicated by the close friendship of Cicely\u0027s ex-husband Marco Angelini and their adult children (David and Marina) with her boss, Commander Whitney and his increasing concern as Eve\u0027s investigation concentrates on the family. Eve discovers that both David Angelini and Marina\u0027s fiance Randall Slade have financial problems which could provide a motive for murder; as additional damaging background information surfaces she appears to be on a collision course with Whitney\u0027s understandable concern both for these children who have suffered the tragic loss of their mother; in addition, the stress increases when it appears that the friendship Whitney\u0027s wife with the family may lead to her potential involvement as a material witness. Finally, a further complication which brings into question Dallas\u0027 objectivity is the revelation that the Angelini family, Cicely Towers and Eve\u0027s lover Roarke are are partners in a business venture.\n\nAdditional murders soon occur which bear the signature trademark of the killer, and media pressure intensifies on Eve given the visible lack of progress in her investigation and the antipathy which she has evoked in C.J. Morse, who coanchors the evening news with her friend Nadine Furst. Eve is infuriated by C.J.\u0027s actions and yet knows that in fact the only effective way to silence the slimeball\u0027s continual attempts to denigrate her investigatory skills during his broadcasts is identify and catch the murderer. Meanwhile, Eve is also involved in establishing the boundaries in her relationship with Roarke, both with regard to their personal lives and when his aid might be appropriate in her police investigation. After several twists, including one diversion which I had not anticipated, the story suddenly rockets towards a violent climax which it is not clear that all the central characters will survive.\n\nIn addition to Roarke, Commander Whitney, Lt. Dallas, and reporter Nadine Furst, this story contains all the series characters introduced in the first volume including Dr. Mira and the unique irrepressible Mavis Freestone and Summerset, all of whom play relatively minor roles in this narrative. Finally, the reader is introduced to Patrol(wo)man Peabody, whose observational skills in her relatively minor role in this case commend her to Eve. She will eventually become both Eve\u0027s good friend and partner on subsequent cases and their complementary styles and skills will combine with their dedication to speaking for the dead and their loved ones will serve them well. \n\nIf you plan to read several volumes of the series, I strongly suggest that you start with NAKED IN DEATH and then read this book even though they are inferior to the two later books which I have read. The later books include details concerning the mysteries of Roarke\u0027s and Dallas\u0027 childhood backgrounds and the impact on their individual lives which provide a context that I would have preferred to have gradually unfold as I completed the series in the sequence which the author intended. And certainly, if you want a romance/detective story then read NASKED IN DEATH. While this book still had some steamy sequences much more typical of Nora Robert\u0027s novels than the later stories in this sequence, they were much more infrequent and better integrated into the story. However, if you only plan to sample a few stories in the series, then I strongly suggest that you skip the early books and concentrate on some of the later novels, including either of the two which I mention at the beginning of this review. The characters and their relationships are much more developed as the series progresses and the plots are also more complex. Meanwhile, I plan to continue to pursue the dual goal of reading each of the new releases as they occur while gradually filling in my knowledge of Dallas\u0027 past cases.\n\nTucker Anderse\n",
    "\nThis is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself. This makes it a largely indispensable supplement, handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism. This is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated, and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear. The reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as Renan, Max Weber and Stalin (although the views of Marx and Engels themselves or Lord Acton and Friedrich Meinecke would have been welcome additions) and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars (Gellner, Anderson, Connor, A.

    "\nIf you are just starting out on photography, I highly recommend this book. It begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making! For this reason alone, I would give it 5 stars. Here in the first chapter, the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures: the photographer, not the equipment. They then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures (at least, the rest of us non-professionals) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high-tech cameras. \n\nIf you read nothing else but the first chapter alone, I would bet that your photography will already begin to improve. Or if not, the first chapter will at least inspire you to try the suggestions and see the result yourself. In fact, even if all you have is a humble point and shoot film camera, the things they teach in the first chapter are still totally valid, as the principles of good photography remains the same whether you use film or digital.\n\nThe next chapters give details about camera operations, how to creatively use camera controls, and another great topic, how to tackle different photographic subjects. Just what I needed! I like the chapter on how to process you own film in black and white. Although I\u0027ll probably not dive into it, this chapter gives you good grounding on the grassroots of photography.\n\nOther good stuff inside:\n\n1. Projects at the end of most every chapter. I dare you to do all the project at chapter one and tell me if it will not improve your understanding of what makes a good picture!\n\n2. Information on digital aspect of photography. Although I shoot film slr, I know that one day, I\u0027ll want a digital slr so the info on it is nice.\n\n3. All the illustative pictures are ones that can be done by amateurs! In keeping with the beginner\u0027s purpose, this is intentional on the part of the authors. If you are looking for award winning photos or famous photographers, you wont find it here. But the pictures in the book are beautiful in their own right and they drive home the points taught. \n\n4. Modest studio lighting you can create yourself! The principles on the very important aspect of light taught here are very revealing to me. The diagram of how to photograph a subject using only your own flash and any old white card to reflect some light is already a good starting point.\n\nHowever, I am tempted to give this book 4 stars since I felt that despite it\u0027s generous information, attractive layout, highly readable text, and wide pages, the authors skimmed the topic on tricky exposure problems. The use of grey cards, spotmeters, and handheld lightmeters to solve these tough light problems were only briefly explained. On the other hand, they provided easily applied solutions to our most common exposure problems. So I give them the benefit of the doubt that such issues correctly belong to advanced photography topics which might only discourage the wobbly beginner if mentioned here. Now that you are aware of it, you will probably do more research on it. Meanwhile, a lot of my pictures are already much improved by the application of the principles in the book alone.\n\nI therefore, highly recommend this book to fellow beginners in photography\n",

    "\nThis story, set early in the \u0026quot;Known Space\u0026quot; period, is an important part of Larry Niven\u0027s future universe, full of his accustomed ingenuity in both the plots and the science. The Protectors don\u0027t fit quite comfortably into the \u0026quot;Known Space\u0026quot; Universe, and have raised some problems later, for example in the famous \u0026quot;Man-Kzin Wars,\u0026quot; where the \u0026quot;Known Space\u0026quot; universe has been shared by other writers, including Poul Anderson, Jerry Pournelle, SM Stirling and Hal Colebatch, but the story is fine space opera and entertainment, and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary SF\n",

    "\nAfter viewing the German artistic mini-series for television many years ago, I decided to read this German family story to rival Galsworthy\u0027s Forsythe Saga. I was not disappointed, because this book deals, among others, with one essential aspect of human existence: man\u0027s difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status. The story of the Buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who, although belong to the same family, can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality. In this family we see characters who are able to adapt, understand the world and compromise, while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self-abandon. This fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature, two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings. It is for this reason that \u0026quot;Buddenbrooks\u0026quot; is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life, a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil\n",
    "\nAlan Lightman is one of those rare individuals who has a solid background in both physics and the humanities.  As a result, he has been able to write this very enjoyable collection of essays dealing with the human context of science, especially physics.  None of the essays are ultra profound, but they\u0027re still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading, especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited.  This book reminds me of \"Feynman\u0027s Rainbow\" by Leonard Mlodinow, which I also found to be very enjoyable and, like Mlodinow\u0027s book, Lightman\u0027s book is a quick read.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the specific essay topics are a mixed bag including autobiography, biography, the relationship between math and physics, the nature and experience of scientific inquiry, and other broader topics such as the influence of technology in human life.\n\nAs indicated in my title, if you have at least a popular-level familiarity with modern physics, and can also appreciate the humanities, I predict that you will find this book to be quite enjoyable, and perhaps also somewhat enlightening.  I enjoyed reading the book, and I expect that I will read it again in the future\n",
    "\nIt may sound as though I am damning this book with faint praise, but I believe that with a subject as complicated as anti-western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener.\n\nWritten in clear non-academic language, Buruma and Margalit have written a book-length essay which further elaborates on the article which they published several years ago in the New York Review of Books. The point of the project is to posit a hypothesis on the roots of anti-western feeling and use that to draw open the discussion as to how the gap can be repaired.\n\nI notice that the original article sparked much less disappointment than the book. There is something about the translation to book form which implies a level of completion or comprehensiveness that an essay by itself cannot achieve. You will find that most reviewers (myself included) had a list of things that we missed in their overview. These omissions felt serious to me, but I notice that the lists have very little in common. It is truly not possible to please everyone or include everything, so perhaps it is just as well that they did not try.\n\nIf you already have an adament point of view in this discussion, then this book may well irritate you. Buruma and Margalit clearly do their best to be as objective as possible, given their own cultural bias. If, however, you are like me and mostly have a clear view about your own lack of answers then you will probably find this a valuable reading experience. Since reading it, I lent the book to a good friend (sorry, publishers!) and we have not been able to stop discussing the points that it raised. Quite an accomplishment, in my opinion, for a self-described short history.\n",
    "\nOkay, the title is a bit much.  But I enjoyed this book tremendously.  Some of the criticisms point to the elements I liked best.  The routine cases, how they were approached, and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what I\u0027ve seen on \"Cops\" (constant action and crisis!).  There was a new story on every page, and I wound up reading until 1 a.m. on a work day because I just couldn\u0027t help reading \"one more page\".  The descriptions of the surroundings, the characters, the sounds and smells of the settings, conjured up a real sense of being there.

    "\n\u0026quot;Disarming Iraq\u0026quot; is Hans Blix\u0027s thought-provoking and historically-important memoir of the few but critical months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, during which he tried to paint a clear picture -- for the UN and the world -- of his inspection team\u0027s findings, claiming no need for urgency and lobbying for diplomacy.\n \n The polarized atmosphere was palpably tense: while the U.S., the UK and Spain insisted that Iraq was not responding to inspections, France, Germany and Russia asserted with equal force that the inspection program had never been fully explored. \n \n Parting the raging waters (for a few weeks, anyway) was the quintessential diplomat Hans Blix. As it reads, he was too diplomatic, unwilling to state his results confidently for fear that it might drive UN policy. It didn?t help that he had a few doubts of his own; that in spite of not finding any \u0026quot;smoking guns\u0026quot; in terms of banned weapons, he still sensed that Iraq was playing a cat-and-mouse game. Either the regime\u0027s odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the UN, or it was hiding something. Either way, Blix\u0027s hesitation was enough to set the stage for Colin Powell\u0027s historic February 5, 2003 presentation of evidence of WMD?s in Iraq, which was more or less the proverbial point of no return.\n \n Apparently, what Mr. Blix was trying to tell us -- before he was drowned out by the noisy din of a fearful and overzealous media -- is now common knowledge about WMD?s in Iraq: Blix\u0027s commission failed to find anything not because the Iraqis succeeded at hiding the weapons, moving them ahead of inspections, but because the weapons really weren?t there. Iraq had disarmed at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, just as they?d claimed. The UN inspection program had worked -- without knowing it.\n \n So how did the war move forward under false pretenses? According to Blix, \u0026quot;a deficit of critical thinking\u0026quot; was to blame. He speculates that our Congress would never affirm the use of force merely to end a reign of terror (even though Blix himself wishes for a UN resolution against brutal dictatorships). The Bush administration had to justify war in Iraq by linking it to terror, and since there was no real link, it had to capitalize on the \u0026quot;theoretical\u0026quot; link of Iraq\u0027s weapons of mass destruction.\n \n This is as far as his speculation goes. Where the phrase \u0026quot;military industrial complex\u0026quot; would seem most natural and expected -- followed by a salacious tell-all about Bush, Cheney and nefarious links to Saudi oil -- Blix cleverly sidesteps the issue of America\u0027s impatient itch for war by feigning ignorance. Giving Blix the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he prefers to be thought of as naive and not sensational.\n \n Needless to say, Dr. David Kelly\u0027s death (the British scientist who leaked to the BBC that the British government had \u0026quot;sexed up\u0026quot; a document alleging Iraq\u0027s nuclear capabilities) was an \u0026quot;unfortunate suicide\u0026quot; -- and not the work of a shadow government. (The entire document, by the way, turned out to be a forgery.)\n \n At least Blix observed the \u0026quot;horse trading\u0026quot; (\u0026quot;intense economic and diplomatic pressures\u0026quot;) our government used to obtain votes from other countries -- votes needed to pass the UN resolution authorizing the use of force -- as well as he disapproved the Bush administration?s spying on UN delegations while on their diplomatic visits to New York. Blix had other objections to U.S.-led efforts, but they are all based on facts and evidence, and are in defense of IAEA (a previous inspection organization, also headed by Blix) and UNMOVIC (the UN\u0027s Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission).\n \n Interestingly, the largest setback to diplomacy was related to a 167-page \u0026quot;cluster\u0026quot; document released by Blix in early March of 2003, which summarized all the inspections for the three preceding months. Unfortunately for France and Germany, American and British members of UNMOVIC leaked pre-release draft copies of the document. In other words, France and Germany had much less time to prepare their official reactions to the cluster document than their British and American counterparts. Their positions, in favor of renewed inspections, were not as compelling.\n \n While Blix?s passion is definitely enough to carry his memoirs, one can easily see why it was so difficult for Americans to take Mr. Blix seriously: he lacks that forcible personality that commands respect. Even so, he is gifted with an even temperament, a good sense of humor, and a deeply-imbued sense of integrity, all important qualities for diplomacy. Although he may have been the only individual capable of peaceably bridging the large gap between the UN and Iraq, in retrospect it may have been asking too much from some of our leaders to match Blix?s diplomatic efforts in their reasonableness and patience\n",

    "\nI think Nora Roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms, as we\u0027ve seen in her books Irish Thoroughbred, Irish Rebel and now True Betrayals which was written in 1996. Unlike the other two, True Betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres. To me, it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours.\n\nKelsey Byden was led to believe that her mother, Naomi Chadwick, had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if she\u0027d come visit her, she was an emotional wreck. It seems the real reason her mother wasn\u0027t a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover. Talk about shock value! Kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions - Kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made Kelsey question everything in her life. \n\nNaomi has a working horse farm in Virginia and Kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life. Sounds like a typical plot line, right? Well, sort of, but if Nora Roberts is writing it, you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way. Like Kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder.\n\nCan the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to Kelsey\u0027s broken heart? Can Kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years?  Will Kelsey ever believe in herself again? I won\u0027t give away any of the plot, you\u0027ll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself!\n\nI do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that I enjoyed the most - sure there\u0027s a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting. Sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the mother-daughter relationship. But what I enjoyed the most were the descriptions of the horse ranch, the surrounding areas, actual workings of the ranch, etc. Nora Roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and I found myself slipping off to Virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book. The lush green landscape, the openness of the working ranch, the racetrack - ah, it sounded like pure heaven.\n\nThe plot is very predictable: everyone lives happily-ever-after, mother and daughter are reunited, true love waits for Kelsey, etc., etc. What makes the story enjoyable is the mix that Roberts has perfected - not just pure romance, but a little mystery and intrigue also.\n",

    "\nWith respect to my qualifications, I am the founder of the Learning Spanish Like Crazy method. I am also the author of several articles written on the topic of learning Spanish. And now for my review . . . \n\nI tend to judge a Spanish-English Dictionary by the following criteria:\n\n1. Does it provide 21st Century Spanish vocabulary words or only outdated\nSpanish vocabulary?\n\n2. Does it provide BOTH the words that are commonly used in Latin America\nAND Spain or only one or the other?\n\nUsing yardstick number one this book did fairly well. I found words such as \"raton\" not only defined as \"mouse\" as in the rodent but also \"mouse\" as in \"computer mouse.\" And \"pantalla\" wasn\u0027t only defined as a \"screen\" but a a \u0027computer monitor\u0027 as well. However, it only used the original definition of \"bajar\" (to lower, to descend, or to go down). It lacked the 21st century definition which is \"to download.\"\n\nUsing yardstick number two, this dictionary did well. For the English word \"block\" I found the Latin American definition of \"cuadra\" but I also found the European definition of the word which is \"manzana.\" Several Spanish-English dictionaries that I have used in the past only define the Spanish word \"manzana\" as the English word \"apple,\" and only define the English word \"block\" as the Spanish word \"cuadra.\"\n\nIt is important that a dictionary provides both the  Latin American and European Spanish words. From my experience, Latin Americans tend to use\ndifferent vocabulary words from one country to another. But if you use the European Spanish word, even though they may not use the word, they will be familiar with it and will understand you. \n\nOverall, I give this dictionary \"cuatro estrellas\" (four stars).  \n",

    "\n     I stumbled upon Matthew Reilly\u0027s novel in the new release section of my public library. I had never heard of him before, this being his first release in the United States, but the synopsis on the inside of the dust jacket caught my attention so I decided to give the book a try.  \n     Most books coming out now have author blurbs of recommendation I take with a grain of salt. Most of these authors are paid for their reviews or they are personnal friends, making it difficult to determine the sincerity of the review.  Everything is promised to be a \"white, knuckle thriller\" or my personal favorite \"a rollercoaster ride of excitement\" but the majority of the time the book does not live up to the hype. This is definately not the case with \"Ice Station\". This book is Action with a capital A! How this book has not been optioned for film bewilders me because if it is done right it would be one of the best action films of the past twenty years. The book alone left me exhausted.\n     For a quick intro without giving anything away (because I hate spoilers) a crisis emerges at an isolated Antarctic research station.  A marine recon team is sent to investigate and all hell breaks loose.  This is not an exaggeration.  When the action begins in this book it does not let up. Every time I thought the book was going to have a down moment to give me the opportunity to eat or get some sleep, I got cold cocked by a left hook.  The characters only pause in the book to reload.\n     Now there will be nay sayers out there who will criticize that the book lacks any real substance.  Maybe there could have been more characterization, perhaps there is a fact or two off when utilizing military jargon or technology, or maybe an event bends the laws of probability but all I can say is I don\u0027t care. I had fun with this book. For the two days I read the book I had a blast. This is not a contender for the pulitzer prize. It is not going to pop up on Oprah\u0027s book club.

    "\nOnce again, Jasper Fforde has created a story that is brilliantly written, perfectly blending English literature with wit.\n\nThe book continues the story of Thursday Next by creating a new conflict, as well as making connections with the previous Thursday Next novels, adding a deeper level to the reading.\n\nHighly recommended reading, but I also recommend you read the series in order\n",
    "\nWith the release of Jasper Fforde\u0027s fourth title in the Thursday Next sci-fi/fantasy series, readers will be treated to the culmination of the alternative Earth that the author has spent three books building. In \"Something Rotten,\" the options for direction for the series are fully realized as the alternate Earth of 1988 and the world of Fiction are completely in place.\n\nWhen last we left the intrepid Thursday Next, she had just saved the world of Fiction from yet another villain intent on its destruction. Pregnant and with her husband erased from history by the evil Goliath Corporation, Thursday\u0027s finally given birth to a son, Friday, who at two year old only speaks in Lorem Ipsum (a good example of the craziness of Fforde\u0027s vision.) Deciding that her time overseeing the purity of novels has worn thin, she returns to Earth and winds up becoming:\n* The target of an assassin\n* The coach of her town\u0027s professional croquet team\n* The thorn in the side of a hypnotic politician who is actually fictional\n* The hostess to Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\n* The on-again, off-again wife to her exterminated, unexterminated husband\n* The finder of a live clone of William Shakespeare\n* The friend of Neanderthals everywhere\n* Dead--twice\n* The holder of the secrets of the apocalypse\n* The once-again savior of the planet\n\nIf you think that\u0027s about three books in one, well that pegs \"Something Rotten.\" Fforde packs this book so full of plot and sub-plot that readers must juggle all those narrative balls at once. That Fforde can bring all this together at the end shows that his mastery of his world has grown since the start of this series, \"The Eyre Affair.\"\n\nWhile not as inventive as his previous book, \"The Well of Lost Plots,\" Fforde\u0027s world-building is largely done, so \"Something Rotten\" can focus on the story and not on backstory--that\u0027s a big plus. Longtime readers of the series will find that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book. For instance, we finally get to see who Millon de Floss is and get a better look at the genetic experiments that have resulted in an England overrun with mammoths, dodos, and Neanderthals.\n\nAll the typical humor that we\u0027ve come to expect from Fforde is here and he\u0027s done well picking up the mantle of Douglas Adams. Someone has to write nutty British sci-fi and Fforde is doing it about as well as anyone right now. And while \"Something Rotten\" is a terrible place for new readers to jump into the Thursday Next books, for fans of the series this is probably the most satisfying of his books.\n\nEnjoy\n",

    "\nI always look to see if an author stands in their truth.  If they walk their talk.  Dr. Christiane Northrup does.  I have read all of her books, Women\u0027s Bodies, Women\u0027s Wisdom, The Wisdom of Menopause and now Mother-Daughter Wisdom.  They all embody her path to well-being and her knowledge on the subject of women\u0027s health.   In her book Mother-Daughter Wisdom, she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness.  I find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy mother-daughter relationship.  I have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up.  I found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters.  Dr. Northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship.  She addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way.  She talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter.  This book is also a  reference book as Dr. Northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughter\u0027s life.  Mothers, men, and women without children, would benefit by reading this book to connect with their own legacy with their mother or if raising a daughter.\n",
    "\nAs the authors state in the preface of the book, the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts. This is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract, but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions, then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate.\n\nMost of the examples presented in the book are written in Eiffel, an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions, postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing. If you haven\u0027t written code in Eiffel I highly recommend that you download EiffelStudio and deploy the examples in this book. Although there are tools that offer assertion facilities, none provide the ease of use as that seen in the Eiffel language. The text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to Java, but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment.\n\nSome aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developer\u0027s environment that minimally supports the functionality. As such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool. The keyword support of contracts in Eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions. \n\nThe authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts. As a sometimes Eiffel developer I can state that this assertion is accurate. Since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors, they are invaluable for debugging. I recall an instance when I encountered a postcondition violation while using a linked list from the Eiffel library. As a client of the class, I didn\u0027t spend any time tracking down the source of the error other than to report it along with the condition that triggered the error to the supplier. In industry significant time is spent debugging code prior to delivery and maintaining code afterwards. Any concept or tool that aids in this function is indispensable to the project. Apparently many people understood this notion since for several years the proposal to broaden Java to include keyword support of programming by contract was purportedly the most frequent \"non-bug\" report requested by Java developers.\n\nThe book is well organized providing a set of step by step instructions on how to write robust contracts applicable to a wide range of examples from simple data structures to more advanced cases such as the implementation of the Observer Pattern. I considered myself well versed in design by contract but the six principles and guidelines as well as the frame rules, introduced successively via examples, provided a more rigorous approach to developing contracts than I had employed in the past.\n\nIn Chapter 2, the distinction between basic and derived queries is discussed and all six principles are introduced through a stack example. Each principle is unveiled in conjunction with designing methods and their contracts for the data structure.\n\nIn the development of the dictionary class in Chapter 3, the authors present a case for a new query which asks if the dictionary already contains a specific key. The query arises from the specific application of the principles pertaining to postconditions. This is an excellent example of how contracts result in the development of new and needed features in a class. \n\nIn Chapter 6, the authors present a clear rational for weakening inherited preconditions and strengthening postconditions and invariants in accordance with other literature pertaining to the same topic. In particular, the example of a delivery service reads like a case of retail agreement in plain language but is complemented by examples of code and UML diagrams. The concept of guarding postconditions with preconditions to facilitate possible redefinition of methods is also introduced and well explained.\n\nChapter 8 covers the benefits of design by contract and if the reader has compiled and executed the examples presented in the book, they will have experienced some of these benefits firsthand. Of course there are considerations like better documentation and more reliable code, but the debugging assistance is the most overt benefit of contracts. The stack traces associated with assertion exceptions are an invaluable tool during both development and maintenance. Anyone who has developed quality software under a tight schedule understands the benefits of precision bug identification and resolution.\n\nAnalysis by contract, introduced in the final chapter, presents the concepts of design by contract abstractly removed from the code specifics. The authors present an analysis of a person withdrawing money from a bank. In doing so they codify the sequence of events based on the contract stating that the design is \"derived from the specification rather than being a design that is also being used as a specification.\" The obvious implication of this is that the final product will likely fulfill the specification implicitly.\n\nThis is a book packed with knowledge that is essential for all developers regardless of the current support of design by contract in conventional languages. In the future, as the more popular languages incorporate additional design by contract concepts, there will be an increased number of authors producing texts on these topics as well as a growing number of developers annotating their resumes accordingly. I suspect that all of these texts will reference Design by Contract by Example and many of the developers that already understand the concept will be well acquainted with the pages of this book.\n",

    "\nOz talks sense. From the first chaper, I was hooked. She suggested making a minor change for the first week. I cut back on one soft drink per day - from 3 down to 2. That was quite painless. I also took her starter tips - drink water before meals and don\u0027t eat closer than 2 hours before bedtime. Again, those were minor and didn\u0027t crimp my style.\n\nThis is not really a diet book though it deals with diet (as in what you eat). It\u0027s really about living well and making mostly good choices but not going overboard (and ultimately failing). \n\nOz is a vegetarian, but she said that red meat was fine in moderation. Go for only twice per week on that she suggested. I love beef, but I also like chicken and fish and can tweak that part of my meal plan. Chips are junk food, but a bowl isn\u0027t a huge deal. Just don\u0027t grab the bag and keep munching. If you have an urge for chocolate, melt some semi-sweet chocolate and dip fruits like strawberries in the chocolate. It really does satisfy that chocolate craving with smaller amounts of chocolate.\n\nThat\u0027s typical of her advice and things that I can handle and maintain.\n\nShe also talks about exercise and about supplements (meant to supplement and not take the place of good food). She\u0027s reasonable with her ideas here as well. I added some extra work out time (even jogging 5 minutes while watching TV adds up if you do it pretty often) and bought a basic vitamin plus B, C and E (all heartily approved by my doc). \n\nOz lost 10 pounds her first semester. This is not a crash course. She\u0027s down 30 lbs now (over 2 years I think) - just slowly and surely. And, she\u0027s maintained rather than yo-yo\u0027ing.\n\nI think most people (college or not) would benefit from reading this book and trying out Oz\u0027s common sense plan. Older readers might need a little less food overall and might not opt to go out and have a snowball fight to burn calories, but the basics are here for a good lifestyle plan that isn\u0027t painful and does work.\n\nThis would be a great book for anyone (females more so) headed off to college or in college. Oz has dealt with being overweight. She did a lot of research and put a workable plan into action. I think most readers will love her style and also will be able to use her ideas and stay slimmer and healthier.   \n",
    "\n\n\nImaginary playmates are not unusual. But, there hasn\u0027t been a playmate like TillyTilly since those nasties Henry James created in \"Turn of the Screw.\"\n\nAnd, like them, TillyTilly seems to be something more than what a child has imagined.\n\nJessamy Harrison, the eight-year-old daughter of a Nigerian mother and a British father, is a precocious and lonely child subject to screaming tantrums and panic attacks. During a visit to her Nigerian relatives, Jess explores an abandoned building and meets TillyTilly, a child of her own age, who she befriends. The problem is, no one else can see TillyTilly.\n\nOn their return to England, TillyTilly mysteriously shows up and soon leads Jess into a heap of trouble. Fun becomes horror as Tilly demonstrates a penchant for cruelty.\n\nGiven that Miss Oyeyemi was only 18 when she penned this complex novel, there are some drawbacks.

    "\n  Once again, David McCullough\u0027s treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind. This biography reads like a fascinating novel, and McCulloughs narrative ability is unmatched. No one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can. \n  The great Theodore Roosevelt, known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong, tough, larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling. The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage, the man who would become President of the United States.\n  Best of all is that McCullough likes and admires his subject.

    "\nI am an inveterate map reader. Whenever I travel there is a map in my pocket. But a recent trip to the Middle East and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as I tried to put in context  the ruins visited and the coins I collected. With time, the names of cities  and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period.   Morkot\u0027s superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps, but the  rationale and context for their evolution and change. One of the best  features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview, followed  by a series of in-depth accounts, each from the perspective of the  important \u0026quot;players\u0026quot; during a given historical period.  This  approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the  same information is repeated and new information added as each of the  regions, their politics and battles, are succesively presented.  From the  Mycenae to the Parthians are thousands of years, thousands of miles, and  thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of  influence affect us even today. For the first time after years of puzzling  over strange Grecian place names and leaders, I am now able to begin to  understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the  birth of Christ.  I wish this had been the first book I read in my study of  ancient history.  I can hardly wait to start on Penguin\u0027s sequel - Acient  Rome\n",

    "\nI like most of Jack Kornfield\u0027s work and this book is no exception.  It has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths.  The focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences.  Also, it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions.  \n\nThere is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general.  Jack Kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely.  In one section, he quotes Ram Dass who once was asked, did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied, \"no.. but I\u0027ve become a connoisseur of my neurosis.\"  \n\nIn another section, Jack talks about vocation or purpose in life.  I found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful.  While the book is good, I think you may get more out of the audio CD because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections.  I think this carries a part of the communication that doesn\u0027t come across in his books.\n\nMy favorite taped work by Jack Kornfield is your Buddha Nature.

If you like After the Ecstasy, the Laundry... you may want to consider purchasing this as well\n",

    "\nBishop presents an entertaining history of bees and beekeeping, and gives us an absolutely fascinting tour into the relationship between humans and bees, both ancient and modern. What she misses are her science references:\n\nOn page 142, Bishop recounts the removal of a stinger: \"...he grabbed the whole sac, which simply squeezed in more venom.\" This is not true. It is an oft-repeated piece of conventional wisdom, but in 1996, entomologists at UC Riverside published an article in The Lancet (348:301-302), with the conclusion that rather than removal method, speed is of the essence. Visscher and Vetter wrote of their conclusion: \"The method of removal is irrelevant, but even slight delays in removal caused by concerns over performing it correctly (or getting out a knife blade or credit card) are likely to increase the dose of venom received. The advice should be changed to simply emphasize that the sting should be removed, and as quickly as possible.\" \n\nOn page 276, Bishop writes about royal jelly \"...worker bees secrete and feed exclusively to a select few fertilized eggs, one of which, on this special diet, will grow into a queen.\"  This is patently incorrect. Royal jelly, as all beekeepers know, is fed to all the brood by nursery bees for the first 2-3 days of the brood\u0027s development. After this time, most brood who are not destined to be queens will receive pollen as food, whereas queens are fed the jelly all their lives. It is rather stunning that an author who keeps bees herself and obviouly spent considerable efforts in researching her book can make such a glaring error in bee knowledge. \n\nThis was quite a blow to me at this point in the book as I have enjoyed the book very much, and to run into such a blatantly uninformed statement from the author caused me major disappointment. Otherwise, this is quite a good, absorbing read.\n",

    "\nOf all the articles and books of Chomsky that I have read, Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched (and footnoted), the most logically  structured, and the most convincing. Chomsky reminds us that the majority  of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their  information about political affairs; both domestic and foreign. One can  only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic. So take, for  example, the popular myth of the \u0027persistent Soviet vetoe\u0027 at the UN during  the cold war. Why do people believe the USSR was constantly vetoeing any  and every Security Council Resolution? Simple! When they did, it generated  front page condemnation. When the US or the UK exercised their right of  veteo: silence. As Chomsky notes, during the years of 1970 and 1989 the  former Soviet Union veteod 8 resolutions. The US veteod some 56. This is  what Chomsky refers to as Thought Control. Unless the public examine the  factual record of the UN themselves, they will never come by this  information, (at least not in the mainstream press). So although Chomsky\u0027s  title may appear somewhat paradoxical, or oxymoronic, a moments reflection  on such facts shows it to be, in fact, extremenly pragmatic and truthful.  The question is, have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself  and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs?  The  crux of Chomsky\u0027s argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what  violence is to a dictatorship. Chomsky points out that, in fact, propaganda  is, contrary to popular postulations, more important and vital to a  democratic society because people still have some rights. That is, since  people can talk, the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words  come out of the peoples\u0027 mouths. In a dictatorship it does not really  matter too much what people think; for whatever they may think, they have  to do what they are told, by pain of death. In countries such as the US  (and the UK) other, more subtle, methods are required.  People often  critisise Chomsky for the sources of his information (the copious  footnotes). No such critique can be levelled at this work. Chomsky\u0027s  sources are declassified internal planning documents, naval proceedings  documents, and the very institutions he examines, New York Times,  Washington Post etc. If there was one Chomsky book I would suggest you to  read, this would be it\n",

    "\n\"East of Eden\" is a beautifully written, sprawling, three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California. The story begins far away in the East, on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons, Adam and Charles. Adam is an upright, honest young man who naturally draws people to him, while Charles has an angry, violent spirit.\nCharles tries in vain to earn the love of his father, and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam. Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love, but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home, knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son. \n\nAdam wanders for many years across the country after his service, and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp, closely mirroring Steinbeck\u0027s own experiences during the Depression. Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives. The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature, but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California. \n\nAdam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch, but Cathy is a vicious, evil character with no redeeming qualities, and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re-emerge much later when her sons are grown. Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch, broken-hearted over Cathy\u0027s desertion, and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever, which become an impossible task. Repeating the pattern of their father\u0027s life, the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their father\u0027s love, with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit. But this time around, Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was.\n\nSteinbeck\u0027s prose is masterful, and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley, lush with the rains, brutal with the drought, capture exactly why men were drawn to the west. His portrayals of character and motives--sadly lacking in the movie--are totally convincing, and his Adam is a flawed but admirable character. \n\nSteinbeck has been a bit out of favor--at least until this was chosen as an Oprah book. As an English-as-a-second-language teacher I recently taught \"The Pearl,\" and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery. (We all read it in high school but I now realize it went right over my head.) Try Steinbeck again--you won\u0027t be disappointed--my book club wasn\u0027t!\n",
    "\nIf you liked Empire, you\u0027ll love Multitude. The authors and reviewers alike speak of Multitude as a follow up to Empire, but I think something very different is happening here. Hardt and Negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory, and in Multitude they have attained a height/depth of perception well beyond Empire. If you are attempting to learn your radicalism, or inform your progressivism, through Hardt and Negri, then you may see Multitude as continuing from and expanding Empire, and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books. But what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book: where Empire was the best try we had at the time, Multitude now succeeds. Where the digression in Empire circled around the feeling of our world-cultural hematopoiesis, the discursion in Multitude captures it.\n\nFukuyama attempted to deal with Multitude in the July 25th NYT Book Review, and either utterly failed at, or purposefully decided to avoid, addressing the book qua philosophy. At this point in his apologizing for economists, it is hard to imagine that Fukuyama\u0027s name has ever been mentioned in the same breath as Hegel, or that he has ever actually read any of the German Idealists;- whereas with Hardt and Negri, we almost have that level of man among us again. For Fukuyama, history has indeed ended, because he has stopped feeling it and can now only move around his darkened signifiers. For Hardt and Negri, and for those who have read, listened, and felt their way into the great becoming that is world history, we are indeed not at its end, but at its very beginning. \n\nThe chief problem with this book is that the English language, as a field of common meaning, is not up to handling this level of thought anymore. (E.g., the very British cheery insufficiency of George Monbiot\u0027s \u0027Manifesto for a New World Order\u0027.) Hardt and Negri wrote Multitude in English, but were thinking in German, that neoplatonic lego of a language. So, if you consider yourself progressive but can\u0027t get the feeling and sweep of Multitude, then trash your TV, stop reading anything written after 1930 for a few years, then come back to it. You will find you have become allergic to CNN, but you will also find that - finally - you can *feel* what the world and her history are all about.\n",

    "\nA very good crime fiction book. Connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you don\u0027t have it already. Why it\u0027s good?\n\n1) Connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional, believable, realistic characters and this book is no different.\n2) A very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department, he\u0027s supposed to have been a crime beat writer.\n3) Logical plot. His books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers, but they can\u0027t be if they are crime fiction. Rather, he takes you through the investigation step by step, going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime. \n\nCons: The only con I have is that the books are somewhat noir (I\u0027m plagarizing this word from some other review). The thing is, Bosch is not your spiffy \"yes sir\", toe the blue line cop.

The problem is not with what information is included so much as what information is *not* included - for example, absent from the entry on Oral Roberts is any mention of the dubious fundraising techniques and outrageous publicity stunts for which he is most (in)famous. Ian Bilby\u0027s entry details his leadership of Elim New Zealand, but includes no mention of the sexual scandal that led to his removal as Elim\u0027s NZ leader. All but the most staggering embarrassments in Pentecostalism\u0027s history seem glossed over, as if not offending anyone was a major principle in deciding what to include.\n\nI would expect a scholarly work to reflect both the glory and the shame of this important subject. This is an annoyance in an otherwise very good work.\n",

    "\nAny beginner or intermediate learner, who wants to be enlightened on the basic mechanisms of both computer and its peripheral devices, would be laying a good foundation by starting with this book. Without compromising its concise outlook, the coverage of this book is as comprehensive as it is illustrative. Its updated chapters are well-appreciated, although that anyone who currently owns the seventh or even the sixth edition would not be missing much by sticking with either editions.\nDespite being labelled \"How Computers Work\", the contents of this book are not limited to PCs. They covered other related issues like: Networking, Multimedia, Printers, Software, and so on. Detailed explanations, which are frequently complemented by high-resolution graphics are abundant. This book literally takes its reader into the \u0027engine room\u0027 that keeps a computer running. It is an impressive virtual tour on paper!\nHowever, if you are an advanced learner, this book will be of little use to you. In fact, there is hardly anything in it that any self-respecting advanced learner has not come across. Likewise, Apple/Mac stalwarts need not invest in it. Its focus is entirely on the PC: with no room for Mac.\nAll-in-all, the uniqueness of this book is plausible. It is a welcomed advantage. Every PC component, as well as peripherals, are laid bare. It is a resourceful hand-holding tools for beginners: a worthy and dependable guide for any novice\n",

It\u0027s a simple enough story to read, compared to some other gay authors but it touches extremely well on problems that one can encounter growing up, first with weight, then intelligence, then being gay.

    "\nThis book was like Madonna\u0027s famous photographic book of 1992 when it hit the shelves in the 1960\u0027s. This is Brown\u0027s manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era. Reader beware ... choices and actions have consequence ... and ponder very carefully before being Cosmopolitan long after the expiration date. Living it up does NOT mean reckless behavior. Values are personal but when one woman\u0027s values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another (ie - affairs with married men) it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others\u0027 heads. People are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them. Although now dated and updated with Sex and the City - ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life. Retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right. Helen Gurley Brown has done alot of good for women pursuing careers, enjouing the single life, and having an identity ... but too much too long has a cost. Do you really want to be like Brown and her counterpart Hefner ... 80 years old and taking hormones in some attempt at youth?\n",
    "\nThis review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.\n\nThis book is targeted to anyone that wants to learn the history of Italian cooking. This book is full of both information and recipes.  This was one of my first Italian cookbooks, and is still one of my favorites.  This book is an authentic Italian cookbook not the Italian-American type that we are accustomed to in the USA.  If you want a good comprehensive book on authentic Italian food this is one of the books that I would recommend.\n\nHowever, if you are a beginner Italian cook, this is not the book for you.  The directions are written for someone that is familiar with the Italian kitchen.  The author assumes you have a basic knowledge of the Italian kitchen and typical recipes.\n\nOne complaint, and it is minor, is the lack of glossy photographs that I have become so accustomed to in cookbooks.  The recipes in this book more than make up for the lack of photographs.\n\nOverall this book is highly recommended for those that are serious about Italian cooking\n",
    "\nBefore the Epiricist philosophers came along, it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true. Basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning. Thus, complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic, working off what was assumed to be true. Then Hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics. Hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories: Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact. Relations of Ideas are things that a true by defintion. 2+2 will always equal 4, because that is how it is defined. Try as we might, we can never successfully imagine 2+2 equalling 5. So relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world. They are definitions we use to describe what is happening. Matters of fact, on the other hand, are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world, such as \"The Sun will rise tomorrow morning.\" Unlike with Relations of Ideas, Matters of Fact are not true my their defintition. We can imagine successfully \"The Sun will not rise tomorrow.\" How, then, if we can imagine the supposed impossible, do we know anything to be truly impossible? Hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry. He effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true. It wasn\u0027t until Kant\u0027s Critique of Pure Reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of Hume\u0027s metaphysics. This is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers\n",

    "\nI really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. There are some very touching passages that get to the heart of what a good marriage is and the unique bond that husband and wife share. I am glad this story wasn\u0027t about finding new love soon after losing someone who was clearly her best friend and soul mate. For the most part it is about finding other areas of pleasure in your life through exploring different types of bonds with friends old and new. It is also about new beginnings while still honoring the memory of the one she\u0027s lost. I could read this novel over and over. The deep respect for marriage is refreshing in a world that can be dismissive of marriage\u0027s sanctity and too often focused on those that fail\n",

    "\nAyn Rand\u0027s masterwork earns its reputation as a monumentally influential book.  It is at least as important today as it was when it was published in 1957.  Altas Shrugged lays out, in the form of a sprawling novel, Rand\u0027s philosophy, Objectivism.  It has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by Americans as the second most influencial to them, trailing only the Bible.\n\nAtlas Shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground, but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society; people who invent, design, build, manufacture, improve and manage.  She lays out the a story of a society that resents these people and their wealth despite the fact that they earned it and that they improved everyone\u0027s standard of living while they improved their own.  Mysteriously, society\u0027s producers start vanishing, one at a time until almost none are left.  The outcome and the explanation are fun reading while they make an important point.\n\nOur society has been wealthy enough for long enough that it is way too easy to take that wealth for granted and forget where it comes from.  The decisions we make when we fail to keep in mind the source of the wealth do really have the power to make our standard of living go away.  Rand reminds us of this critical, but easily forgotten lesson in an eloquent way.\n\nRead it and then tell ten friends to read it too.  More of us need to see this side of the story.  The fact that it\u0027s unpopular right now just makes it that much more fun\n",

    "\n  Horowitz with the help of researchers provides glimpses of the \"101 most dangerous academics in America.\" Your own political outlook will determine whether you think Horowitz is an American hero or a buffoon.\n\n  I\u0027ll vote for American hero as Horowitz provides details on professors whose very existence on a campus should motivate people concerned for their children and the destiny of the United States to march on the legislatures that use taxpayer funds to pay most of these \"academics\" demanding their immediate termination.\n\n  College has changed. Where the goal was once to teach young minds to think independently, it is now a place for intdoctrination, with punishment meted out for non-conformance to the various left-wing doctrines being rammed down the throats of young adults.\n\n  The book is so densely packed that choosing representative excerpts could easily create a shorter bookof its own. For example, Professor Jose Angel Gutierrez opines \"[w]e have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him.\" This from a licensed attorney, now a professor paid from the public purse - taxpayer dollars. Prof. Alison Jaggar, another beneficiary of taxpayer money, seeks to combat the \"male-dominant structure of everyday life.\" She seeks, essentially, a world without men. Not exactly an inclusive outlook.\n\n  The examples cited above are mild. Most are far worse - and these are the people, often supported by taxpayers in public colleges, who are forcing their views into the minds of young people. With tenure and increasing control of the hiring process, other views are shut out of the academy. The academy itself is being converted into a political training ground. Many of these left-wing radicals are tenured and can not be fired, not even the likes of Prof. Haunani-Kay Trask who says \"[t]he enemy is the United States of America and everyone who supports it.\" She also advocates the deportation of all non-ethnic Hawaiians from the islands. And the taxpayers foot the bill for her to \"teach\".\n\n  Some of the names are familiar to many as talking heads, such as Prof. Joseph Massad who demands the destruction of Israel and denies that the Jews are a nation. Imagine what happens to a student, a Jewish student in particular, who disputes Massad\u0027s views. This happened and Massad screamed at the students. When the matter was investigated - a rarity - Massad conveniently couldn\u0027t remember the incidents.\n\n  Other of these professors make equally outlandish claims, many of them based on race, gender or sexual preference.\n\n  Reading this book is a sure invitation to outrage - and then depression as you realize that there is little the average citizen can do to stop what is happening, unless citizens band together to create enough of an uproar as does happen on all too rare occasion.\n\n  A must-read for anyone concerned with the fate of America\u0027s young minds and the nation itself.\n\nJerr\n",

    "\nIf not, here is a chance to find out. Two figures left an imprint on the French art amidst the turbulent times of the late nineteenth century. Manet, whom history dubbed the father of Impressionism (although at the time art critics branded him untalented) and Meissonier, then the highest paid painters and now a figure obscured by history. How did time turn the tables on these two characters? Why is Meissonier forgotten, while the Manet\u0027s paintings sell with $20 million price tag? The answer is in this book. \n\nMr. King\u0027s skillful examination of the art\u0027s progression from its realism to the appearance of impressionism in the latter part of 1800\u0027s makes for a delightful reading. He analyzes the art critics of the time, the leading political figures, the consequences of a war with Prussia, the French life and French economy. \n\nWritten with intellectual appeal and with an eye on the events that drove history, The Judgment of Paris is highly recommend to all lovers of historical non-fiction. \n\n-by Simon Cleveland\n",
    "\nThis book is more dated than THE SECRET GARDEN, but it\u0027s still a great story. It\u0027s hard NOT to identify with Sara Crewe.\n\nI loved this book as a child (though not as much as I loved THE SECRET GARDEN, which I think is a better book). However, A LITTLE PRINCESS may appeal more to some people; some readers may find the story stronger and the main character, Sara Crewe, more likable. Sara\u0027s determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own. Some scenes (I don\u0027t want to spoil the surprise by describing them) are magical.  \n\nA LITTLE PRINCESS is a great story that makes readers think. Some of those thoughts make you uncomfortable, like the thoughts about differences between rich and poor children - but that (I think) is part of the book\u0027s greatness. \n\nBe sure to get an unabridged edition: this book is beautifully written and should not be simplified. Kids now CAN read and will love this book: at least, every girl to whom I have given a copy has read it and reread it -- on her own.\n\nFor a modern, well-written book about another girl at an English boarding school, read Libby Koponen\u0027s BLOW OUT THE MOON. It has the same classic feel, though American heroine is very different from Sara in some ways (though she too is determined to hang onto her identity) and MOON is quite funny\n",

    "\nJesse Stone is sort of Spenser\u0027s alter ego. He\u0027s younger, and Spenser\u0027s never had a drinking problem, but other than that, they\u0027re pretty much the same character, except Stone\u0027s about thirty years younger. Robert B. Parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now: this is the fourth Stone novel, there are 31 Spenser novels, three featuring his third character, Sunny Randall, and nine books that aren\u0027t part of a series, some of them non-fiction. That\u0027s 47 books, for those who aren\u0027t keeping up with the math. Obviously, by now Parker knows what he\u0027s doing. He seems able to write one of these every six months or so: he alternates between Randall, Spenser, and Stone with ease, and just floats along.\n\nIn this outing, Stone\u0027s faced with a real problem. Paradise (the town he\u0027s Chief of Police in) has been hit by a rash of killings, and it\u0027s soon apparent that they\u0027re the work of a serial killer, or killers. Stone has no way of tracking the killer at first, and the killers seem able to strike with impunity and kill whoever they wish.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u0027s also a scared girl at the local high school, the victim of a gang rape and some threats afterwards. Stone has to resolve things, and control the situation so that the girl doesn\u0027t get hurt.\n\nAnd of course there\u0027s his personal life, which has been a problem for him since the series started with Night Passage. His ex-wife is a manipulative sociopath, interested in only herself and how she can control him, near as I can tell. In this installment, she attempts to manipulate him more than she should, and things take some interesting turns.\n\nI enjoyed this book a great deal, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading\n",
    "\nJane Hirshfield and Mariko Aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka-- manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity. I had a friend who was a Japanese scholar, who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka. I have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well. Hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called \"On Japanese Poetry and the Process of Translation\". I recommend it highly, even if you do not normally read this kind of essay.\n\nI am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry. Shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and Ono no Komachi was one of the Rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. The reason that I am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself.\n\nThese poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship. They are strong and sad and very affecting. There is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves, so I will close this review with one of the poems by Shikibu:\n\nWhat is the use\nof cherishing life in spring?\nIts flowers\nonly shackle us\nto this world\n",
    "\nBefore reading this book, I\u0027d had a much more black-and-white (sc., mostly black) impression of Jewish life in medieval and early modern Europe. This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. Ghetto walls were an injustice, but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. Oddly enough, this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia, who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors). Katz\u0027s discussions of of Jewish martyrs during the First Crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa, among other topics, are also quite fascinating. \n",

    "\nH.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent, world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted. The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way, particularly their sentiment that the British had an \u0027obligation\u0027 to \u0027civilize\u0027 the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Well\u0027s book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal, and although he didn\u0027t knock it down, he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way, the Martians *were* the conquering British, with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.  Wells\u0027 dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didn\u0027t give one whit about the British (or anyone else\u0027s) false boast of superiority. In the end, though, it\u0027s a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they weren\u0027t biologically suited to live in this world, Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies, suggesting that the British wouldn\u0027t survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail. And they did. On top of all that, it\u0027s rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense.\n\nAnd that\u0027s why it\u0027s still in print a hundred years later.\n\n-Mark Wakely, author of An Audience for Einstei\n",

It literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400. I just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head, thinking this has to get better, considering how good the first 2/3rd\u0027s were.\n\nI also have to say that I was disappointed with the ending - it was way too contrived for me... SPOILER ALERT*** - I found it EXTREMELY unbelievable that Dracula would \u0027assume\u0027 that Helen died in the fall and not gone after her, as the author states when Helen is recounting how she made it out alive from the fall. I mean, come on... Dracula is supposedly all knowing and has tracked this woman all over the world. Now were supposed to believe that he simply says \"damn, she fell - I guess after all I\u0027ve been through, I won\u0027t bother to check - I\u0027ll just find another victim\" - sorry, didn\u0027t buy it and it really was a big let down after so much potential in the beginning..\n\nOverall, the book was really great.

    "\nWendell Jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat.  The verdict was suicide, but the insurance company that had sold him a half-million dollar insurance policy is not convinced.  When 5 years passed, the company was forced to pay the premium to Jaffe\u0027s wife.  Two months later, a man looking very much like Jaffe is spotted in Mexico.  The insurance company hires private investigator Kinsey Millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be Jaffe, along with his girlfriend Renata.

Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts).  Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot.  It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are\n",

It also gives you a good peek into the  corruption behind campaigns and politics in general. I really liked the  characters in this book, although each one, in my opinion, could have used  some more depth.   The only reason this book doesn\u0027t get 5 stars is because  as you read it - you start to feel that the second half of the book  \u0026lt;with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book\u0026gt; was completely  RUSHED.  I really don\u0027t like a sudden closing to a book. However, it really  does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages.  I just feel that it  could have had MORE of an impact, and MORE of that \u0026quot;UMPH\u0026quot; had the  story been written at the same speed throughout. I do recommend this book  for anyone who just wants a good book to read.  If you\u0027re looking for  something you will remember for life - this isn\u0027t going to be it.  But if  you\u0027re looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon - - - by all  means, try reading Mary Jane Clark\u0027s \u0026quot;Do You...etc.\u0026quot;   Final  word: I believe her mother-in-law, the OTHER Clark, would be quite proud of  her ex-daughter in law.  The woman can write.  However, given her talents,  I wish she would learn to write in her own style, instead of in the  familiar style of the OTHER Clark\n",

    "\nReviewers are right about this book tracing the origins of the modern surveillance state back to the birth of the modern prison system but they are not mentioning the prime motive for this that Foucault points to: profit and capitalism.  With the rise of industrial society it was more important to regiment and discipline the masses than \u0027off with their head\u0027 or hands.  The panopticon prison idea was taken to the factory and service industry by industial giants like Carnegie and Rockefeller and the fruits of this profitable perversion can be seen all over society today: delivery drivers monitored throughout the day by GPS, social security cards, public schooling (founded by the same industrial giants) intellectual and psychological grading, job placement and conformity, credit ratings, licences needed to do everything but go to the bathroom, a growing snitch culture...Foucault\u0027s major thesis is that surveillance (discipline) aids profit and any deviation from profit leads to state-sanctioned punishment in the form of increased surveillance.  As industry and profits increase so will the surveillance and discipline that make it run smoothly.  Every facet of modern society works to this end.  The irony is, as techno-pundits like McCluhan later pointed out, in the modern world the prisoner with a tv set has as much denatured freedom as the tycoon in his guarded estate and they enjoy a lot of the same things in a world where pleasure is increasingly programmed and vicarious; in a world that has turned from the moral order to the profit order, where bad credit today is the profit order version of the ancient moral order idea of excommunication.  Everything that stands in the way of the profit order, whether it be an idea, person, religion, or country is attacked.  Bottom line, we are all \u0027human resources\u0027 in the political economy, in the religion of capital: packaged and packed like a bunch of sardines with the capitalist state and its laws protecting the tabernacle of profit over all else.  The inanity and inherent fraud of our system, not to mention the explosion of prison populations and an insane consumer society, makes a lot more sense after being traced by a renegade like Foucault.  Of all his books this is also the easiest read.  This is a beautiful book by a complicated man.  by the way, he taught at the University of Buffalo for a short time. \n",

    "\nHannah Arendt\u0027s _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century, Soviet Communism and Nazism, and traces their historical roots.  The book is divided into three volumes focusing on Antisemitism, Imperialism, and Totalitarianism.  The first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of Antisemitism.  Arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of Antisemitism.  For example, some historians have argued based on a \"scapegoat theory\" that the Jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world\u0027s ills.  Arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the Jews.  Arendt explores the rise of Antisemitism in the birth of the nation-state, the emancipation of the Jews, the rise of the Jewish financiers, the roles of Jews within society, and the infamous Dreyfus affair.  Of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as Benjamin Disraeli or the infamous forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  The idea that the Jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of Antisemitism.  The second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of Imperialism.  Here, a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as Count Arthur de Gobineau and various forms of Social Darwinism.  The role of the Boers in South Africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as Cecil Rhodes, who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic Nordic elite, is made.  The great Pan Movements, Pan-Slavism, Pan-Germanism, and the Pan-Arabism of T. E. Lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored.  The final volume of this book is concerned with Totalitarianism proper.  Here, the role of propaganda and the secret police, as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.  Arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing.  Arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely.  Repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent.  Written during the Cold War period and just after the Second World War, this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.  Their movements of Nazism and Soviet Communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished.  The book is important today not only for historical reasons, but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world\n",
    "\nI found Airframe to be a great book to read on my summer vacation.  I was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary (i.e. the media).  That being said, I was not the least disappointed.  \n\nIn his typical style, Crichton takes an aerospace engineering course and boils it down to plain English.  I learned so much about the construction of airplanes and the airline industry - it was fascinating.  He also does a great job in raking the mass media over the coals - which was fun (and somewhat ironic from the creator of \"ER\")!\n\nThe book is fast paced and reads like a movie - which I am sure is no coincidence by Crichton ;)  The main character is very likeable and you find yourself rooting for her.  There are a number of plot twists and surprises and it certainly keeps you turning the pages.\n\nIn summary I would not say that this is Crichton\u0027s best work, but it is surely a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to everyone\n",

I hope this title is now offered in many seminaries, because its content would be a gold mine for young, soon-to-be church leaders.

    "\n\n\tThe 2005 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Robert Aumann and Thomas C. Schelling.  Schelling is professor of Economics at the University of Maryland and applied game theory to conflict.  His focus was on the weapons issues but his ideas have been applied to a host of business issues.\n\n\tIn this review, we will apply some of Shelling\u0027s concepts to how companies fire employees.\n\n\tSchelling says \"uncertain retaliation is more efficient than certain retaliation\" when bargaining and \"the capability to retaliate is more useful than the ability to defend.\"  Now let\u0027s get practical.\n\n\t\t\tGOODBYE SCENARIO\n\n\tAs a verb, \"goodbye\" is the act of parting.  It is also an acknowledgement of parting.  A goodbye scenario assumes that once employees physically leave the building, they will never be a factor for the company\u0027s future.  The relationship was transactional and the transaction is now over.  \n\n\tIf the firm defines the termination as a goodbye scenario, the firm should be guided by a business model that says, \"What\u0027s the least expensive way of terminating this relationship?\"  And Board members should ask tough questions about paying too much.\n\n\t\t\tAUWIEDERSEHEN SCENARIO\n\n\t\"Auwiedersehen\" is German for \"Until we meet again.\"  It has a more open-ended quality than the English \"goodbye.\"  In an auwiedersehen scenario, the assumption is that once employees physically leave the building, they may continue to be a factor in the firm\u0027s future.  But it is unclear what that factor may be.\n\nAfter their non-compete contracts are over, they may join a smaller competitor and become potential allies or opponents in your firm\u0027s efforts to develop strategic alliances or acquire the firm.  \n\nThey may join firms that touch your industry and become potential referral sources of new business for you or a potential source of caution to others about using your company.\n\nThey may attend alumni programs at their schools and encourage/discourage graduates from joining your firm.\n\nEach of these scenarios assumes capability of retaliation plus uncertainty of retaliation.   \n\nThe best practical defense in terminating employees under these conditions is \"Treat  people with dignity on the way out because the assured costs of such positive treatment are less than the potential downside retaliatory risks.\n\n\t\tAUWIEDERSEHEN VS IT\u0027S NICE TO BE NICE\n\n\tWe work with companies that treat departing leaders with dignity \non the grounds that  \"it is good public relations and good for morale if we help former employees achieve a `soft landing.\u0027\"  This positive rationale works only in cultures supportive of such a rationale.  \n\n\tThe Schelling rationale does not depend on an organizion having a specific culture for treating people with dignity.  \n\n\tIt develops a contingency approach to management based on a risk assessment.\n\nThere may be times when a \"goodbye\" scenario does indeed make good sense.  There are other times when \"auwiedersehen\" makes better economic sense. \n\nIn applying Professor Schelling\u0027s theories, management\u0027s failure to take defensive measures with those possessing abilities and options to retaliate is is just bad economics.  One sees it at work every day.\n\n\n\n(...)\n\n",

Each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time:  Time is Money, Time Flows Uphill, Live in the Present - Forget the Past, Time is Motion, etc. \n\nLightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing, each could be the setting for powerful stories.

    "\nIt\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve read one of Janet Evanovich\u0027s Stephanie Plum novels, but a sudden need for light reading found Ten Big Ones at the book store.  Plum\u0027s biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after Joe Morelli or Ranger, how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station, and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed.  Definitely light fare, even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic. He not only wants Stephanie dead, but he also wants her end to be spectacular.\n\nStephanie\u0027s response is to break up with her steady boyfriend, Joe Morelli, again, gorge on jelly donuts, and go into hiding at one of Ranger\u0027s lairs.  Of course, this doesn\u0027t work as well as it should because even Ranger\u0027s soap is too sexy for words.  And Stephanie, glutton for punishment that she is, she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile.  So, you see, this is standard Stephanie Plum fare - lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss, usually with bad timing.\n\nMy issue with Evanovich\u0027s books isn\u0027t with any particular one, but with what happens if you read too many at one time.  Stephanie\u0027s biggest problem is herself - a decided lack of common sense.  Which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter, but leaves her gun in the cookie jar.  In four hundred pages this is funny, but if you\u0027ve been reading a lot in a row, the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is d�j� vu all over again.  After a break of a year or so this goes away and I found Ten Big Ones a pleasure to read.  It introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history.  By all means, if you need a break from the weight of the world, take the time to read this. \n",
    "\nI\u0027ve long been a fan of Borges the short fiction writer. But this little book has made me an instant fan of Borges the reader and Borges the literary critic. I have to admit that so much of petry mystifies me, but within the pages of this book, I felt as if Borges\u0027 insight was finally allowing me to understand poetry in a way I hadn\u0027t considered before. Witty, modest and polymathic, Borges shines through the pages of this book.

    "\nAll right... All right, I say. So I\u0027m writing about a preteen book about a little girl. That doesn\u0027t make me weird does it? It shouldn\u0027t since I had to read it for a college course. So I\u0027m writing because, well, who would\u0027ve ever guessed, but I loved it? It\u0027s a ripping story, man. It is funny, inventive, historic and riveting, all the things I was sure it wouldn\u0027t be when I got assigned the book. So, here I am, blown away by a book about a little girl. I don\u0027t even like history, but it wasn\u0027t presented as antiquated. It was dealt with as you and I would deal with our history, as pertinent, in the moment, and nothing that has been generated and worked over in a history book. I\u0027m telling you, the character Darby is great, as are all the characters, including the total garps that go around spouting their racist jargon, etc, until Darby unintentionally questions everything, causing all matter of problems, like maybe she\u0027ll get knocked off by the Klan. The story is actually something you\u0027ll find yourself absolutely focused on. I couldn\u0027t put it down. I\u0027ve read a lot of adolescent fiction for this class, and I can say that if I had a kid, I\u0027d be pouring this down their brain. So, does that make me weird? Who cares, huh?

    "\nI decided to read this book because I enjoyed Dr. O\u0027Connor\u0027s book, Undoing Depression so much.  I am delighted to report that Undoing Perpetual Stress is an even better book.\n\nWhat is perpetual stress like?  The metaphor that Dr. O\u0027Connor uses is that of an impala who thinks there\u0027s a cheetah behind every rock.  The flight or fight response is never at rest . . . and the poor impala\u0027s health is soon destroyed.\n\nDr. O\u0027Connor argues that our over stimulating world creates the same kinds of stress from unseen \"threats\" as the world goes whizzing by at 75 miles per hour.\n\nIn the book, he describes the sources of the stress, how stress undermines your body, immune system, brain and mind, and what you can do to put the stress comfortably in the background.  \n\nThis book will appeal to those who are stressed out, those who experience anxiety and depression at the same time, those who love such people, and those who want to better understand the mind-body connection based on the latest scientific research.\n\nUndoing Perpetual Stress is filled with many helpful exercises that will help even those who don\u0027t think they have too much stress.  One of the best from my perspective was taking a psychological snapshot of yourself every five years . . . and spotting what was wrong with your life at each stage.  I was astonished to realize how many memories I had repressed, but which are still influencing my psychology.  And Dr. O\u0027Connor is good about reminding you to \"practice, practice, practice\" the exercises and his advice.\n\nI have been a meditator for over ten years, and this book helped me to gain a lot of perspective on what the meditation is helping and what it is not.  While I have eliminated a lot of the background noise, I haven\u0027t dealt with a lot of old issues.  It was helpful to find out what those issues are . . . and what to do about them.  I found that my creativity and mind were suddenly freed by the process.\n\nFor parents, there\u0027s a lot of new information here on how various parenting methods influence a child over a lifetime.  It\u0027s a lot better than what you read in that first book about how to be a parent.  Check it out!\n\nThis book should be required reading for anyone who finishes high school\n",

I laughed and cried almost simultaneously while reading several of the stories. \n\nIf you have sons, or have friends that have sons, this book is a must.

    "\nFew works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece. This is one of them.\n\nThucydides crisp account of the long struggle that brought disaster to his native Athens is remarkable for it\u0027s candor, despite events that must have been tragically painful. The text includes legendary personalities (Pericles, Alcibiades, Demosthenes, Nicias, etc): their actions, words, and fate. Facts license readers to decide what\u0027s important, and the events described are worthy of discerning the essence of humanity.\n\nWho would have thought the promise of Persian defeat (told by Herodotus) would be squandered in a tedious contest that ultimately proved grave for all involved? Athens\u0027 distinction as the first democracy makes it a vital epic (given recent attempts to democratize the Middle East). Melos destiny at Athens\u0027 hands may give pause. As may the Syracuse expedition (especially Book Seven).\n\nI read Warner\u0027s translation thirty years ago (it was 50p then), and still turn to it from time to time.

    "\nI too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as I wanted.  This is a perfect metaphor for the book \"When All You\u0027ve Ever Wanted Isn\u0027t Enough\".  The book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside, that always seems to want something more.  Until they arrive at that \"something more\", people can never truly feel content.\n\nAs is the case with most of Kushner\u0027s writing, he uses a book of the old testament to further his explanation. In this case, he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of Ecclesiastes.  This book of the Bible finds its author searching for more in life.  In the end, the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance.  \n\nKushner\u0027s overall point is best summarized on page 189.  Does it make a difference if I am honest, good, or faithful?  It does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune.  \"... It matters if we are true to ourselves, to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them.  It matters if we learn how to share our lives with others, making them and their world different, rather than try and hoard life to ourselves.  It matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day, food and work and love and friendship, as encounters with the divine, encounters that teach us not only that God is real but that we are real too.\"  \n\nIt is a simple yet beautiful message.  People that live this message will certainly discover the beauty in their life\n",

Waldron painstakingly discusses everything you\u0027d ever want to know  about  the show, and he interviewed (seemingly) everyone connected with the  show, including Carl Reiner, Mary Tyler Moore, Dick, Larry Matthews, Rose  Marie, and many of the writers.

The movie, of course, was focused mostly on the fast food industry.\n\nMorgan Spurlock is always a surprise. You seem him with his long sideburns and know he is from West Virginia and you just expect the stereotype. He is not a stereotype. The book is written in a very clear voice, the same intelligent humorous voice that came across in the movie, \"Super Size Me.\"\n\nMy one disappointment is that I was hoping the book would have more details about the diet that his girlfriend put him on when he finished his 30 days, but now I see she has her own book.

    "\nThe nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the Outsider\u0027s incorrect perceptions or the Insider\u0027s preconceptions, depending on which is constructing the definition. What we find with W.J. Cash\u0027s The Mind of the South is no different, although it is a pleasant journey. Sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing, Cash\u0027s work deserves recognition for this reason alone; yet there is value in the exposition itself, even if it forgets a full two-thirds of the South\u0027s population in its description (blacks and women). What the modern reader is left with, then, is not so much a description of the \"the southern mind\" as it is \"the white southern male mind.\" And while Cash\u0027s work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind, it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the American South, with a small dash of glory added for good measure. \n\nFirst, it is important for us to take into account the wonderful introduction to the work by Bertram Wyatt-Brown. Wyatt-Brown shows that Cash\u0027s battle with depression was a salient part in understanding his interpretation of the South, as was his upbringing. Wyatt-Brown seems to agree with my assessment on the Insider/Outsider effect:\n\n    \"The origins of Cash\u0027s interpretation of his culture and region lay not only in the objective fact of Southern intransigence about issues of race and change, but in the very makeup of his mind. Like so many creative depressives, he stood apart from the society around him. Such a position of detachment can provide a special angle of vision that those immersed in society cannot obtain (Cash xxvii).\" \n\nWyatt-Brown, with this statement, makes Cash an outside-Insider, by virtue of his being a manic depressive. He is a southerner, and therefore capable of the same preconceptions of his own people as any southerner; however, according to Wyatt-Brown, by reason of his mental condition, he is elevated away from this status and into a new status altogether, a presumably better one. I would agree with this, if the work itself is to be taken as proof. Cash is capable of wonderful insights into his own culture and society. However - and this is crucial! - we must not gloss over the fact that by omitting women and blacks from his work, Cash loses some credibility. It is here, it seems, that Cash could not escape the Insider mentality. \n\nThis work is characterized by one over-arching theme: southern culture, though as elusive in most respects as any other, is penetrated throughout with one defining and collective temperament. In essence, this work is interpretative rather than linear, as it attempts to analyze rather than delineate. This elevates Cash from the traditional historian (in the mold of Clement Eaton) to sociologist or social commentator (in the mold of David Halberstam). That is not to say that Cash does not know his history or pilfers it from others; it seems impossible after reading The Mind of the South for one to imagine Cash using such smooth language while pulling facts from anywhere outside his own mind. The disjointed quality usually apparent in any attempt to fuse sources without an overall voice is thankfully absent. Cash is who we hear while we read, and it is his elucidative brush-strokes that paint the image of the Southerner.\n\nMuch is left out of this short review of Cash\u0027s work, as brevity is a consideration. A more complex examination of the work would require many more words than I have time for at the moment. But I do feel obligated to at least sum up the trajectory of Cash\u0027s masterpiece. The first few chapters lay the groundwork for Cash\u0027s southern temperament - individualistic, violent, quasi-aristocratic, provincial, just to name a few - while the remainder of the work displays the evolution of that temperament while it is worked upon by forces both outside it and from within, and its own natural need to adapt. The Yankee plays his part, as does Uncle Tom and the fugitive slave, the southern belle and the Garrison abolitionist, the carpet-bagger and the scalawag, the confederate soldier and the lynch mob, the fire-eater and the bible-thumping revivalist. It is impossible for any society to exist in a vacuum, or as a prehistoric insect preserved in amber. That being said, it is still remarkable that the American south came as close as it did\n",

    "\nWhile I agree with several people who don\u0027t consider this chick-lit, I don\u0027t see why that is a bad thing. I enjoyed Radish\u0027s writing style, purple prose and all. If you\u0027re expecting a Dickensian journey into a complex character, this book is not it. However, it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life. \n\nYes, the (positive and negative) circumstances of Meg\u0027s life were unrealistic, but I felt they were dramatized to make a point. We all have strong, kind, and amazing people in our lives, but we have to look for these things in people. I had an aunt just like Marcia, who fought her battles with a fantastic sense of humor, courage, and love for everyone around her. The message I took from this book is this - life can be all you want if you simply take the time to nourish your own strength and that of those around you. It doesn\u0027t take money to be powerful and satisfied with your life\n",
    "\nKudos to Finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter.  The fact that he himself, a descendent of Holocaust survivors, has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points: you cannot criticize the state of Israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti-Semite.  Any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless UN resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism.  By far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the Swiss banks; this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition.  Finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion.  Very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work.  Hilberg\u0027s endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight, and those unfamiliar with his seminal multi-volume set The Destruction of European Jews would be well served to check it out\n",

He shares meditative techniques developed over many years and very rich personal experiences with excerpts from his running journal.  The book is well thought-out and written with a great deal of humility and care.  This is one that I will read again and again.  It changed the way I approach running.

She is a strong proponent of getting up and moving to better your life and shows it here by offering a few modifications you can make to your way of eating to help you lose weight, but no real diet, which I think is great!  It helps to show that the real health factor is getting the exercise you need, not feeling deprived of the food you want which is why many diets fail.\n\nShe has many success stories to motivate you peppered throughout the book and closes with a discussion about how stress affects your life and how you can beat it through exercise.  \n\nI love Leslie!  She is personable, motivating, and a great teacher - I am forever grateful to her for getting this former couch potato, at-home mom to stick to an exercise routine that I know will always benefit my life\n",

    "\nThis book was originally published ca 1980 as England and Always.  I have not seen the original so I can\u0027t tell how much of this book is new material (beyond a chapter dealing with Peter Jackson\u0027s films).  Lobdell has examined Tolkien\u0027s writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives.  One of the most interesting deals with the influence of Edwardian adventure fiction (Haggard, etc.) on Tolkien.  Another fascinating chapter deals with Middle Earth as a Christian world in a pre-Christian age.  There is also a short fiction story in an Appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to Tolkien\u0027s own abandoned sequel to The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the Shadow.  I enjoyed this story, though of course Lobdell as a fiction writer cannot measure up to Tolkien. (But then, no one can!)\n\nI am a long time Tolkien reader and addict (since the age of 12 in 1969.)  Most of the time I do not care for Tolkien \"criticism\" and \"literary analysis\", which to me seems to suck out the magic, but Lobdell\u0027s work is different.  The World of the Rings enhances Middle Earth and intensifies the love I feel for it\n",

It DOES NOT deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse (the author explicitly states this on many occasions) and the reviewer who suggested that this is \"a terrific book if you are child molester\" probably (I guess) didn\u0027t bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy.\nThe author shows how even trained professionals can disregard overwhelming evidence against a particular hypothesis (repressed memory/MPD/satanic cults) and rely on their intuition to (unintentionally) wreak havoc with their clients lives. In the upside-down world of some therapists, lack of hard evidence is trumped by strength of feeling for even the most outrageous accusation. Pendergrast demonstrates how uncertain and malleable human memory can be.\nThe book is written in an easy style and despite what another particularly stupid review suggests, concentrates specifically on the scientific evidence for his claims\n",

    "\nPhyllis Chesler is a most unusual feminist. She really doesn\u0027t fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority, gender feminist crowd. The one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth. This seems to be her most pervasive (and endearing) feature as an intellectual, and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent \"Death of Feminism\" release. Here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be. Numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text. On the whole, it makes for compelling reading. We find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else. They have many of the same, yet subtlety different, characteristics as do men. In these pages, Chesler illustrates the magnitude of inter-woman hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner. Many mother-daughter conflicts are projected into adult situations. Why feminists wouldn\u0027t have wanted this published seems rather silly to me. We should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy. Chesler never implies any inter-sex superiority or inferiority, she is content to describe what is, and it\u0027s great stuff indeed.\n",

    "\nRaskolnikov, an impovershed student in 19th Century St. Petersburg, conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker. He justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse. The world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education. Killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes. After all, the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society. The crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with Raskolnikov\u0027s angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering. Almost every major character in the book is more likeable that Raskolnikov.\n\nThe philosophy of Dostoyevsky\u0027s book seems to be primarily a refutation of Hegelian and proto-Nietschian philosophy and an affirmation of Christian values. Along the way he also manages to work in a rebuttal of social-Darwinism.  \n\nHaving known, prosecuted, and defended hundreds of murderers, I was much taken by Raskolnikov\u0027s psychological progression from crime to atonement. Much of his self justification rang true to my experience. I have known many killers who thought of themselves as superior beings above the law, and many others who justified killing on the grounds that the victim lacked human worth. So long as the killer can keep the victim dehumanized, the killer can live with the deed. When the killer begins to regard the victim as a fellow human, guilt sets in and many confess--often years later. Raskolnikov\u0027s behavioural symptoms did not, however, ring true to my experience. Although some killers are guilt-ridden to the point of distraction, they can usually control themselves much better than Raskolnikov. His actions practically shouted his guilt. \n\nThe interplay of the large cast of characters gave the book great psychological depth, but Dostoyevsky didn\u0027t beat the reader over the head with the psychology.  He didn\u0027t tell you what the characters were thinking.  Their actions showed you what they were thinking. In my experience, most modern psycho-dramas ladle out the psychology in huge dollops. Modern writers would do well to re-read Dostoyevsky.\n\nThe abridged audio edition read by Michael Sheen is three hours long, and the tale does not suffer much from the massive abridgement necessary to get the story on three CD\u0027s.  My greatest complaint with the edition is that Sheen reads the story with a British accent, and the characters all speak with British accents.  It was somewhat hard to adjust to a Russian novel read with a British accent. \n",

    "\nIn Faith in Nation, Anthony Marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the \"literary trope\" (p 15) about a liberal, inclusive Western nationalism. Instead, he argues that even the \"truest\" brand of Western nationalism-that of England and France-came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale. His entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today. This leads one to question why does he insist on such a position? Has he made the case for it? What happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong? \n\nI will argue that the definition of the state, or the lack thereof, is key to answering all of the above questions. Only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state, can Marx trace the genesis of Western nationalism back to as early as the 16th century, thus cementing the linkage between Western nationalism and religious violence. However, the liberal adaptation of the concept of the state puts Marx\u0027s entire theory on shaky ground.  \n\nAccording to Marx, the state is the raison d\u0027tat of nationalism: for nationalism to become a historical force, it \"must ... refer to a state as an existing structure or potential object of engagement\" (p 8). Although he declares early and clearly what nationalism is (p 4), he never spells out his definition of a state. In fact, what we would think of as a modern state today can hardly be found in 16th century Europe. \n\nOnly when the definition of a state is sufficiently loosened, can Marx backdate nationalism to the 16th century, when most of the political authorities at the time existed in the form of royal courts. Only after he pushes back the genesis of nationalism, can Marx connect the religious violence of the 16th century to nationalism. Only when the religious violence is viewed as part of the history of nation building, does it acquire significance in the nature of Western nationalism. Otherwise, the St. Barthelme Day massacre or the burnings at Smithfield is just another \"normal\" religious upheavals in history, thus any association the massacre or the burnings may have with nation building would be purely coincidental-as Liah Greenfeld implied when Marx quoted her in saying, \"Frenchness was disassociating itself from Catholicism.\" To Anthony Marx, however, French nationalism and its French Catholic identity are not external to each other. They are just different stages in the same dialectic process. Therefore, real \"Frenchness\" is actually the public oblivion in France of the strange relationship between the church and the state1. \n\nYet all the grand reasoning depends on Marx\u0027s definition of the state. After all, can we call the royal courts of the 16th century \"states\"? Not only has Marx not given his readers a clear answer, some of his own writings seem to contradict each other. For example, Marx mentions that the Treaty of Westphalia marks the beginning of the modern states (p 35). But the French War of Religions and the reign of Mary Tudor-the very conflicts that are supposedly at the core of nation-state building-occurred almost a century earlier. Even if we use the later date, 1648, as the beginning of the state system, one still has to be cautious to label all subsequent political authorities \"states\". Regardless whether Louis XIV actually said \"I am the state\", the fact that monarchical authority is directly associated with an individual ruler makes it transient in nature (relative to institutionalized modern government), therefore it can hardly be designated the \"object of engagement\" for nationalist ideology. \n\nSince Marx\u0027s concept of the state is on shaky ground, his entire theory appears highly questionable. I would argue, however, there are two options that can salvage his arguments. One is to weaken the link between nationalism and the state. In other words, nationalism may develop independent of the state. This observation may have a wider application outside of the context of Western history than inside of it. The other option is to introduce a third element, such as political culture, that can bridge the violent past and state and nation building in later times. For example, one accepts that the massive fratricide did happen earlier than the emergence of the nation-state. Nevertheless, the bloodshed molded a new political culture, which manifested itself as a more inclusive nationalism when the nation-state took shape later. If such an interpretation proves to be a more sensible reading of history than that of Marx, then Marx\u0027s criticism of Western nationalism can be easily appropriated to deconstruct the Western political culture-the liberal democracy-itself: that it has a ugly past but short memory. However, is the world ready for such a \"total recall\"?\n",

    "\nI think one of my major problems was the level of opinion being shot\nat the reader in the book. But then at times that made the book more\nentertaining - its acerbic opinion of the right, how Reagan getting\nelected made her feel stupid about being American, a funny British couple. The description of small details from each of the characters\u0027 childhood was something I\ncould relate to because i think of that myself. There were clever\ntidbits from anthropology, and economics, and generally all fields of\nintellectual inquiry, all somehow connected with the patchwork of love\nand relationships, and thus brain meets heart and you end up with\nsomething almost like the Bible for our times. The focus on the main\ncharacter made it so that every detail about him was described.\nAnyway, I am rambling, so, a note about the ending:\nI did find myself thinking this is getting very strange as the book\ngot towards the ending. It might have made more sense if Nelson\nactually was interested in the new girl the narrator finds for him,\nand the story then comes full circle. It would end in a nice ironic\nsort of way. However, his rejecting her makes in my mind for what\nwould be a bad traditional ending. I don\u0027t mind this, since the one\ntime I wrote a story for a creative writing course I ended up with a\nterrible traditional ending. Now, could he have been anything other\nthan a mystic? I felt that there was some hint towards Hinduism and\nspirituality building up towards the end. He mentioned India and\nHinduism unexpectedly and repeatedly at one point in the book. So his\nbecoming a mystic was alluding perhaps to the ashramas - and his\ntransition from intellectual worker to a mystical worker to eventually\na sage, as he attains Nirvana and becomes the Buddha of our times. So\nin this way an ending emphasizing the spiritual, is perhaps the best.\nIn line with the book, the spiritual is the eternal, and only\naccessible through life-changing (near-death) experience. What you do\nfrom 25-50 (making a model village in rural Africa) is transient (can\nnever be perfect; infighting; hunting; guns; the \"dark-side\" of human\nnature will come back even in Utopia; i like the flexible hours; work\nwhen you want; accumulate credits; do manual labor once in a while;\nstart the day with reading , not the end when you are tired; siesta,\nfiesta etc.) no matter how good you are. The girl herself is secondary\nto the book - ironic since the book promotes feminism, is written by a\nguy with a female narrator but a male protagonist, who she is fixated\non and has doubts about. But in the end the Jesus character is still\nmale. While the female goes back to Palo Alto and takes an average job\nin service of the savior. The Man has the final laugh.\nDo you favor a better ending\n",

    "\nIn the last few decades historians --following sociologists such as Durkheim-- have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people\u0027s experience of space and time.  Schivelbusch\u0027s small piece is a pretty good (but light-weight) example of  this genre. He reveals some interesting trivia along the way: he tells, for  example, how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of  first-class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed; he  shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting  social values of Europe and America. But he is at his most interesting when  describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of  geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations.  Furthermore, by creating the need for standardized time-tables, railways  nurtured a standardized/homogenized conception of time. Local  idiocyncracies became less important. Doubtless true national identities  could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and  communications. A book that takes these ideas much further is Stephen  Kern\u0027s excellent work \u0026quot;The Culture of Time and Space.\u0026quot; If this  genre interests you, Kern\u0027s book is an important read\n",
    "\nThis is my favorite of the series thus far. Without wanting to give too much away, this is the book in which you finally learn just exactly why Roland is willing to give up anything and everything (and clearly has) just to get to the Dark Tower. King mentions that the Dark Tower series is sort of like his Middle-Earth, where all of his stories originate in some way from this massive odyssey and world, and you see what he means with this book. Fan\u0027s of The Stand will recognize signs of the super flu within the first few hundred pages, and one of my all time favorite King villains comes back to pay his respects\n",

    "\nHal Zina Bennett\u0027s profound advice from his prolific writing career (over 30 published books) is, \u0026quot;write from the heart\u0026quot;.  As wonderful as that sounds, most writers know it\u0027s not an easy thing to do.  \tHal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader. I can speak from my own personal experience, having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book, \u0026quot;Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance:  Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual\u0026quot;. \t\u0026quot;Write From the Heart\u0026quot; also offers practical guidance in several areas.  This includes such things as the need for solitude.  However, he is not just talking about having \u0026quot;a quiet space\u0026quot;, he goes beyond the physical to the inner - a state of mind.  He says, \u0026quot;Once we know what it is, what it looks like and feels like, we can create it for ourselves, almost--I say \u0026quot;almost\u0026quot;--regardless of where we happen to be.\u0026quot;  \tI would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published\n",

Harding combs through Falwell\u0027s history and sermons to observe how the language of \u0026quot;being born again\u0026quot; affects the listener, showing Falwell\u0027s shift from separatism to political activism.

    "\nFirst off this is \"A History of Hollywood\" not \"THE History of Hollywood.\"  David Thomson isn\u0027t writing the chronological, straight-up, blow-by-blow account of Hollywood movies.  \"The Whole Equation\" is an essay that takes as its question, \"are Hollywood films ever art like a Beethoven symphony or a Picasso painting?\"  He says they are both more and less than that.  More because American film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen.  That serendipity is wonderful when it works which isn\u0027t often.  Less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits.\n\nAnd unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension.  His argument is that to understand and appreciate American film, you have to understand that it\u0027s always about the money and about the art.  That means it is never truly art in any pure way (but is any art truly pure?). To tell you the truth, I don\u0027t think the book succeeds that well on that level.  He  points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of American film but he doesn\u0027t developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight.\n\nFor me, that just didn\u0027t matter.  What makes it a terrific read is that David Thomson knows and loves film.  He writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic.  He uses the film \"Chinatown\" as his framing device and as that is my all-time favorite movie, I was in heaven.  He is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater, the audience, the actors, the costumes, the music, all of it.  He constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film, you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.\n",

    "\n\"Underground Education\" does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective, as is perhaps implied by the title. But rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past. Some of the historical figures are famous, such as George Washington and Cleopatra. While others, like the several female serial killers discussed, are more obscure. The book is divided into 10 chapters, including the arts, religion, science and sex. Actually, this book reminds me somewhat of the \"People\u0027s Almanac\" series written by David Wallechinsky. But here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse. It\u0027s a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge. But some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover. Still it is a worthwhile purchase.\n",

    "\nColonial Fantasies is a powerfully argued and engaging dissection of colonial psychology, critiques of Orientalism that isolate gender and culture, and the Western feminist adoption of the rescue paradigm.  One of Yegenoglu\u0027s incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the Western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process.  As desire frames the relation between the subject and its other, Yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation.  As a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen, the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest, but simultaneously displaced (62).  Her argumentation is lucid and compelling: for the colonial gaze, the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire (in the fantasy of unveiling) as well as the bte-noire, because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project.  The veil therefore frustrates the identity-forming process of the subject-object positioning in colonialist discourse; the subject cannot quite see the object, and its subjectivity thus remains in question.  Interestingly, this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by Western feminism.  As the veil has come to signify the backwardness of Islam and its inherent oppression of women, the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference.  In this dynamic, the identity of the liberated Western woman is constructed vis--vis the oppressed Muslim woman (102).  Since the status of Western women is contingent on the continued representation of Muslim women as oppressed, Yegenoglu reveals that the Western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of colonialism.  Yegenoglu then exposes the fallacy of assuming the unveiled woman to be normative; such universal constructions serve particular political ends in outmoded Enlightenment ideology.  She argues that unveiling and veiling are both cultural practices particular to certain cultures and historical moments (115).  This facilitates the deconstruction of the binary by unfixing the poles.  In sum, Yegenoglu\u0027s critical analysis of the colonial fantasy has produced a thorough tome sure to provoke further discussion among post-colonial theorists\n",
    "\nThis book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on \"death row,\" at least in the state of Mississippi, and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences.  It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty.  However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime.  The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime.  Sam\u0027s grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from \"death row.\" The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution.  Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prison\u0027s chaplain.\n\nI found it to be one of the better John Grisham books.\n",

    "\nQuite often, we read books for young people where the main characters must lean to care for others and not just themselves-where the main character must break away from childhood egocentrism and emerge into the adult world.  In Katherine Paterson\u0027s Lyddie, readers find the opposite theme:  Learning to not lose oneself in the responsibilities of the adult world. \n\nThe novel follows Lydia Worthen, a teenager in 1840s Vermont.  With her father gone to seek his fortune, Lyddie, with some help from her brother Charlie, must take charge of the family farm, her emotionally unstable mother, and her younger sisters.  To cover the farm debt, Lyddie\u0027s mother leases the farm and sends her oldest children into forced servitude.  After a year of misery working for a local tavern, Lyddie becomes a mill hand in Lowell, Massachusetts.  While there, Lyddie\u0027s sole focus becomes earning the money to pay off the farm debt and reunite her family.  Her hard work and single-mindedness earn her a reputation as a \"skinflint\" and \"Amazon.\"  It\u0027s only after the farm is sold, her youngest sister dies, her mother is sent to the asylum, her remaining siblings are adopted by another family, and her job is lost over fraudulent charges that Lyddie begins to look out for herself-that she begins to ask what she wants for herself.\n\nWhile Lyddie is not Paterson\u0027s best work, the book does provide lively insight to factory life in Lowell, where many young women flocked in the early 1840s for economic opportunity.  While readers are not thrown into the heart of the labor movement, we are able to see the conditions that led to organized labor: The long hours, the sexual harassment, the illness and disease resulting from mill work.  Still, all of this background provides a fitting setting for the story of a young woman who must learn that she has more to offer the world than her back-breaking labor.  If you\u0027ve enjoyed Paterson\u0027s other works of historical fiction, Lyddie will not disappoint.  \n\n",

    "\nFabulously entertaining novel from Martin Amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing `Information.\u0027 John Self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials.

John has also landed a gig directing a feature film, titled `Good Money,\u0027 and `Bad Money,\u0027 depending on what day of the week it is.

I looked into the proud drama of her face, the valves and orbits of her throat, the wetlook runnels of her hair, the breasts, heavier than ever, solidly mounted on the ribcage, the naked slopes of the belly, the sudden flaring of the hips, a smell of sleep. \n`Then what do you think is the point of you?\u0027\n`You\u0027, she said, `are unreal\u0027 (226). \n\nYou should read Amis for his remarkable power of description, his talent for black comedy and middle-aged disillusionment.

Granted the premise is implausible: a group of former SEALS assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the SEALS believe have sold the country down the river (or, in the Southern vernacular, because \"they needed killin\u0027\"). While one can argue whether the SEALS have the high moral ground in this setting, it doesn\u0027t detract from the page-turning non-stop action.

    "\nThe Waste Lands, the third novel in Stephen King\u0027s The Dark Tower series is by far the best volume yet.  This volume picks up a short time after the end of Drawing of the Three, and we see Roland training Eddie and Susannah to become true gunslingers in Roland\u0027s world.  Soon into the novel, the three gunslingers encounter one the Guardians of Mid-World, a huge cyborg bear, who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds.  Roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the Dark Tower by a beam, and if they follow the beam, it will lead them directly to the Dark Tower, they just don\u0027t know how far away it is.\n\nAs the three gunslingers start to follow the beam, we, the readers, are taken to our own world and reintroduced to Jake, the ill-fated child from The Gunslinger.  Jake is currently having a mental breakdown (as is Roland) due to the fact that Roland saved him from dying his destined death at the hands of a Cadillac in The Drawing of the Three.  One part of Jake tells him he should be dead, the other says he should be alive.  Jake\u0027s mental breakdown leads him on a journey across New York to a haunted house that has many connections with other characters in the book, and in this house, Jake believes he can get back to Mid-World and be reunited with Roland.\n\nThe final part of the journey in The Waste Lands, takes our group to a city called Lud, on the outskirts of the waste lands.  The group believes they need to find a monorail named Blaine in the city, and he will help them on their journey to the Dark Tower.  Once they enter the city, much goes wrong and we are introduced to a really cool, but really evil character called the Tick-Tock Man, who runs Lud.  All of this leads up to a ridiculously exciting conclusion and a killer cliffhanger that makes me really glad I waited to read these until they were all published.\n\nAs far as action and suspense goes, The Waste Lands takes the cake easily from the previous two books.  Most of all, this book makes us appreciate the character development from the previous books.  We care so much about these characters, and would be devastated if anything were to happen to them.  This book also goes a long way in providing some much needed answers about the Dark Tower in general and Mid-World.  These answers are both satisfying and frustrating.  They are satisfying that you aren\u0027t completely clueless as to what is going on, but there are deeper answers to everything that we are given in this novel, so it just makes you want to read on more.\n\nThe series just keeps getting better as it goes along\n",

I went back after reading Twilight and re-read my favorite sections more than once. The love story was hypnotizing and surprisingly seductive. I definitely plan on recommend this book, mainly to teenage girls who will swoon over Edward.\n\nHowever, I only gave the book four stars. While I enjoyed it immensley as I read the novel, a few things bothered me upon looking back: \n\n1) While Meyer deinitely has a talent for writing an engaging novel full of beautiful descriptions, the character descriptions at times felt extremely lazy. If I had to read one more time about Edward\u0027s marble, angelic face (what, exactly, does that mean??), his liquid topaz eyes, or how Bella glared at Edward, I thought I was going to pitch the book down the aisle of the plane.\n\n2) I\u0027m not sure I buy their romance. It was heartstopping and climactic during the read, but honestly, what DOES he see in her? If Bella keeps asking that question to herself, maybe her audience shoud seriously consider it. \n\n3)Bella herself bothered me. I found Bella to be horribly dependent on Edward to the point that I got irritated with her. And her constantly having to catch her breath around Edward -- Puh-leeze. Be a woman! Stand on your own feet! She never fully developed into a character for me since she revolved solely around Edward, something that I, as a self-sustained woman, cannot connect with.\n\nAnd lastly, 4)Bella wants so desperately to become a vampire, but that seems like it could pose a problem between herself and Edward. Since I haven\u0027t seen any evidence that Edward likes Bella for any other reason than that she smells wonderful (a scent that she has because she is human and has blood coursing through her veins, mind you), what happens when she no longer smells good? Meyer is really going to have to prove to me that Edward actually loves Bella for other reasons than her smell, otherwise it will be completely unbelievable if Bella turns into a vampire and Edward is still attracted to this ordinary girl...\n\nAlthough the plot has its shortcomings, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and that is why I give it four stars. I will read the next one when it comes out, and any other subsequent after that, for the simple reason that the books are entertaining and Edward is so dang alluring\n",
    "\nBoston is trembling under the shadow of a serial murderer with a notably gruesome method of dispatching his victims - brutal, savage rape, an obviously knowledgeable, skillful removal of the uterus while the victim still lives with the coup de grace coming as a slashed throat and severing of the carotid artery! Little wonder the media has awarded him the moniker \"The Surgeon\". In the course of their investigations, detectives Thomas Moore and Jane Rizzoli discover an earlier case with a virtually identical MO in Savannah in which the murderer, Andrew Capra, was ultimately killed by a stalwart would-be victim who fought back and shot him before he could finish the job! They are startled to discover that the surviving victim, Dr Catherine Cordell, is a noted cardiac surgeon currently practicing in a major Boston hospital, and beyond all belief in the possibility of coincidences, she appears to be the target of the now active killer!\n\nOnce again, Gerritsen has unerringly brought her intimate knowledge of medicine and the hospital milieu to the table. But, contrary to what one might fairly expect from Gerritsen\u0027s past work, has successfully served up a compelling investigative police procedural which lovingly details the forensics, the pathology, the profiling and the gut-wrenching detail in the relentless task force style search for a psychopathic serial murderer! Several superbly paced sub-plots are inextricably woven into one another as the story unfolds - Cordell\u0027s slow recovery from the assault she endured two years ago and her halting re-integration into life and the hospital work force; Jane Rizzoli\u0027s bristly temperament as the lone Boston female homicide detective and her work-life struggles against the \"old boy\" attitude of the police force; Thomas Moore\u0027s extended grieving period over the untimely loss of his dearly loved wife and the difficulties he faces as he recognizes his entirely inappropriate blossoming romantic feelings for Catherine Cordell; the task force style investigation of \"The Surgeon\" and his relationship with the long dead Georgia killer; and, Cordell\u0027s daily life in the cardiac ward and the emergency room of the hospital and the brilliantly described relationship she maintains with her working partner, Dr Peter Falco.\n\nNot only does Gerritsen handle all of this with skill and aplomb but, with every passing page and each successful murder, she ratchets up the suspense as we realize the killer is taunting the police, honing his skills and reaching for Catherine Cordell as his ultimate target. Yet he constantly remains one step ahead of the investigation.\n\nA great addition to the library if, like me, you love your easy reading page-flipping thrillers!\n\nPaul Weis\n",
    "\nEngrossing and amusing travelogue by world\u0027s crankiest traveler.\n\nSome people really hate Theroux, accusing him of snobbery, self importance, and bigotry.  I can certainly see why some readers wouldn\u0027t be able to deal with his style and opinions, but I must say that this volume might be a pretty good litmus test of readers\u0027 tolerance for the author\u0027s travel works.  (If you can enjoy this one, you\u0027ll probably enjoy his other non-fiction works).\n\nI, for one, totally enjoyed hearing about grunge-y has-been towns, obnoxious holiday camps, and seedy hotels.  To me, the book was a real page-turner, and he writes so vividly of scenery.  I felt he wrote about the worst bits of his trip with true humor, reminding us travelers that it\u0027s helpful to keep a sense of humor during the rough times.  \n\nI felt the book was a pretty decent scouting report for the island\u0027s shoreline, and I now know what to avoid there.  I can definitely thank Theroux and his fussy standards!  \n\nIf you like Theroux, it\u0027s a good bet you\u0027ll love this one.\n\n \n",
    "\nMy father was a chef, and although we did not have much money, I was brought up appreciating good, fresh, healthy food as well as cookbooks -- my father had a library of cookbooks, gastronomic dictionaries, even cookbooks in French (he was trained by a french chef in the 1950\u0027s).\n\nWith that being said, I am obsessed with eating, and occasionally cooking, good food.  This cookbook is the one I use over and over again.  I have cooked almost every recipe in the book, more than once, which is a true testament to a wonderful cookbook.\n\nThe beauty of it is that is is simple -- most ingredients are things you would have on-hand.  Most recipes are for the novice cook, but can be challenging enough for a true obsessed gourmet.  The other aspect is that he balances flavors and spices perfectly -- nothing is too overly spiced, heavy, etc.  When I cook for guests, I use this cookbook because it is manageable but makes me look like a genius.  People always say to me, \"This tastes better than restaurant food!\"\n\nGet the hardback version -- it will last longer and make you feel like a true cook (as we all can be.\n",

My ex may never get back with me because we are long distance but I feel I am loving her much better than before because of this book even if she doesn\u0027t realize it.  Remember to NEVER tell your lover that you read this book, especially if he/she is nervous about being manipulated\n",
    "\nI\u0027m glad I bought this book and I will continue to refer to it.  The remit of the Dummies series is to provide a guide to its subject matter without any great fuss.  The text focuses on practical techniques without unnecessary diversion into the detail of molecular biology or computer science.  In this respect it would have been a difficult book to author, readers having come from one discipline or the other.  I agree with previous reviewers that this is well worth reading before doing a bioinformatics course or degree.  Bioinformatics is a new field, and this book has delivered a useful introduction to it without recourse to expensive textbooks full of unreadable filler\n",
    "\nI won\u0027t spoil the ending, but some many other reviewers didn\u0027t like the twist.  However, the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100% happy should read Runaway Jury.  However, like The Firm (another great book) that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble, this book has a very realistic ending that you didn\u0027t expect.  This was my favorite Grisham book, followed by The Firm, Runaway Jury, and Pelican Brief.  I found the Broker to be too much of an Italian lesson, the Brethern simplistic, and The Street Lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people - with very little story holding it together.  If you like the Firm you will like The Partner\n",
    "\nHere is the disclaimer:  I was already a proponent of tort reform before I read this book.  However, after reading this novel, I am a stronger proponent of it than ever.  Enter Clay Carter - unknown defender in D.C. of the poorest of the poor.  Then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap, one he can\u0027t refuse, partly because the parent\u0027s of his long-time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money.\n\nGive Carter a taste of money, then the greed sets in.  For the middle half of the book, we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life!  Especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the well-being of his clients.  This is what will be his undoing.  One of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer.  This is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months.\n\nGrisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater (Clay Carter) through his rise, and especially his fall.  That shows to the quality of his storytelling.  In fact, while Carter is in some ways a sympathetic character, he mostly is not!  Mass torts and greed is the theme of this story.  The fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice.  Too bad such justice doesn\u0027t often happen in the real world of mass torts\n",
    "\nThis book is rather different. Although it\u0027s about Copernicus\u0027 book \"De Revolutionibus\", very little astronomy is discussed. There is also very little about Copernicus himself. The main theme of the book is finding as many still-existing copies of Copernicus\u0027 book as possible, and describing each one in detail - the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so-called \"census\" of that ancient book, i.e., a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world. Since I know nothing about antique book collecting, I learned a lot on this field by reading this book. I was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book, especially identifying the authors of any hand-written notes on its pages. I did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous, but some of the author\u0027s adventures are quite intriguing, particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere. Some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book, as well as discussions of some of Copernicus\u0027 contemporaries, are touched upon. But as the author states, this book is really a memoir of his census project. I think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting.\n",
    "\nLike pretty much anything in which Neil\u0027s involved, this a fine and useful work. The reviews of Teddy Millon\u0027s Axis II taxonomic extensions are worth most of the considerable price of admission here all by themselves. But after 30 years in the field, I\u0027ll warn any newcomers that getting any too rigid with treatment plan rollouts will make you as nuts at the people you\u0027re treating. \n\nAs -guidelines- with notions about starting points and signposts along the way, however, these are very useful. Neil\u0027s six-step Treatment Outline seems a bit oddly ordered, and I wasn\u0027t able to find a rationale for determining diagnosis in the final step (when you have to lay one on the client\u0027s payment guarantor at the outset). But otherwise, the six steps are another handy construction among several now available. \n\nIf you\u0027re fairly new in the field, this will be a real handy reference, but don\u0027t stake the clients\u0027 lives (or your own serenity) on this when they start to go refractive. \n",
    "\n         Diane Ravitch discusses the development of censorship in textbooks and on tests that has been slowly integrated into the educational system.  She speaks about the rights of the First Amendment pertaining to free speech, and provides a detailed history of how censorship has become a part of the textbooks and tests that have been developed.  The book is informative and thought- provoking.\n\tRavitch starts by discussing the creation of bias and sensitivity boards and how they have come to dominate what can and cannot be said in certain literature for education.  She goes on to talk about certain topics and words that must not be used.  This list is ridiculous and completely irrational.  Due to left and right wing intervention, almost everything of interest has been stripped from the educational requirements.  Ravitch discusses in great detail the effort of both sides and what their motives were in demanding that certain changes be made in textbooks and tests.  She goes further to detail the goals of each side and how they were met.  She argues that such censorship keeps children from learning historically accurate facts because adults would rather paint a picture of Utopia and keep children from feeling any emotions.  \n\tRavitch presents a good, convincing argument with concrete reasoning to support her views.  To the best of my knowledge and research, she has done a great job at gathering accurate information about what has been going on in publishing companies and the struggles they have faced from bias and sensitivity reviews, feminists, minorities, and other groups.  Her reasoning is inductively strong with few logical fallacies.  Occasionally, Ravitch begs the question through circular reasoning and attacks the motives of some publishing companies.  Although she has clear concise points, Ravitch intermittently distorts the timeline within chapters, which is slightly confusing.  Her claims are logically consistent and her argument seems complete with all the relevant evidence presented.  Throughout research, Ravitch manages to also find publishing companies who have tried to change standards and incorporate more accurate facts in textbooks and what happens to these companies when they go against the bias and sensitivity rules.  The argument Ravitch presents is a historically accurate account of censorship in textbooks, fairly and effectively arguing her point.  \n\tToday, more and more people are beginning to notice what is going on with censorship in textbooks and are speaking up and taking steps toward removing these censors.  Textbooks are becoming more accurate, and classic literature reintroduced to the classroom.  Ravitch calls for the dispersion of the \"language police\" and a return to the \"freedom of speech\" that everyone has the right to exercise.  \n",

    "\nMystery-writer biographer Cece Caruso is in the midst of book on Nancy Drew author \"Carolyn Keene\" (actually a pseudonym for numerous authors) when her bookstore-owner friends ask her to deliver a vintage Nancy Drew book to collector Edgar Edwards. Cece is more than happy for an excuse to meet the eccentric millionaire collector. They strike up an immediate friendship, and after showing her his collection, he shows her something really special--a nude portrait of the model who posed for the original Nancy Drew covers. \n\nCece is scheduled to give a luncheon speech at a Nancy Drew convention in nearby Palm Springs, and Edward invites her to use his vacation house there. Delighted at her good fortune, Cece packs up herself and her two friends, Lael and Bridget, a boatload of vintage clothes (which she collects, though she told Edgar she collected nothing) and head for a fun girls\u0027 weekend. Unfortunately, someone throws a kink into their plans--a big kink. A dead body. Edgar\u0027s body. \n\nThe suspects are many, including Edgar\u0027s boy-toy friend and his majordomo; a wild-eyed Nancy Drew fanatic who wouldn\u0027t have wanted that nude painting made public; her less-than-honest, performance artist daughter; Bridget\u0027s new boy-toy boyfriend; a shi-shi art dealer. And, of course, Cece herself, who could have endeared herself to the police had she not insisted on solving the mystery herself. But her curiosity about the model in the nude painting, the artist who did the painting, and anything connected to Nancy Drew gets the better of her. \n\nThe second in the Cece Caruso series is a fun, fast-paced puzzler, and Cece and her \"chums\" give Nancy a run for her money. The Nancy Drew trivia is fascinating, and the many references to vintage clothing makes me want to learn more. My one beef--Cece leaves town, twice, and stays gone for hours on end without making arrangements for anyone to take care of her dog and cat. I mean, maybe she did make arrangements, but if it was mentioned, I missed it.\n",
    "\nI consider myself an optimist and insightful person, but somehow managed to miss many of Postrel\u0027s insights. She gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than I previously thought. She does keep that hope in check, though, by talking about the enemies of the future- primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat, instead of the blessing that it is. \n\nShe thoroughly destroys the notion that \u0027there is nothing new under that sun\u0027. While the universe, therefore our earth, is necessarily finite, we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in. For example, a deck of cards has only 52 cards, but the number of combinations you can put the cards into is 52x51x50x49x...x3x2x1, which is a number larger than the number of particles in the universe! So whenever you shuffle a deck of cards, you can rest assured, that that is probably the one and only time that arrangement of cards will ever be in existence... ever. \n\nPeople are so inventive and creative and always looking for new things. Obviously, there will always be new things. Every time someone declares that we are nearing the end of history, science, technology, etc. it\u0027s safe to say they have no idea what they are talking about. We need to let people be as creative and as inventive as they can. It will only make our lives better, on the whole. There will always be setbacks, but as long as people can think, we will always find a way to make out of those setbacks. \n\nThe book is a stunning, intelligent look at modern life. I liked it so much, I bought The Substance of Style, which is, yet, another insightful look at modern life.\n",
    "\nAfter seeing the movie, I decided to pick up the book.  This book proved to be very funny, as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many, many women her age face today.  Fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true, often serious real-life topics (being single and not liking it, infidelity, betrayal)and is yet able turn it into light, funny reading.  That takes talent, in my book.  In the wrong hands, this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read(in light of the above topics).  You cant help but root for Bridget.\n\nI recommend this book and its sequel.  Most everyone will get a good laugh out of it\n",

    "\nI first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990\u0027s. It aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion. Like many a cynic I asked myself, \"Now who\u0027s this guy and what\u0027s he spinning?\" Against my natural inclination to dismiss it, I ordered POG. On receiving it I began reading and found my suspicions confirmed: here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God.\n\nStrangely, however, I couldn\u0027t stop reading. Despite months of scrawling angry counter-arguments in the margins of its pages I was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about God\u0027s delight in being God. To make this story short, I found myself, in the end, exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of God that Piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth. And finally happy too, with the beginnings of the joy Piper wished for his sons in the Foreword.\n\nSalvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated - at first. The fact that POG eventually had such an unnatural (or supernatural) effect on someone like me - initially so inclined to resist and rebuff - speaks more to the validity of this book than if I had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration.\n\nThis is not a critical analysis of POG; others have provided that sufficiently on this page. Instead it\u0027s a personal account of the Irresistible Grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where God\u0027s glory was seen...and is now sung.\n",

    "\nThis is the sort of book I have been looking for a long time. I\u0027ve read other books on the Middle East which purport to have a similar focus, but which are instead incomplete, notably \"Sowing the Wind\". This book, by contrast, maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region. It looks as if the book was written as a textbook for (I would presume) grad students studying the subject, but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal.\n\nAn issue with a book like this is the tone of the work, how well the author writes. Kamrava isn\u0027t the second coming of Hemingway, but he\u0027s not too bad, either. The book is divided into two portions: first, a historical section that gives you an overview of the region\u0027s history, and second a topical section that looks at various issues that impact the region currently. The first section is very readable, the second less so (who actually enjoys reading about economics?). The author, however, does a good job (for the most part) of not sounding like a university professor telling you about something, though he does occasionally use words that are obscure, especially in terms of sub-regions of the Mid East.\n\nI still enjoyed this book, thought I got a lot out of it, and would recommend it. The author seems to be a hair more optimistic about the prospects for peace and prosperity in the region than I am, but he makes a good case for his point of view, and the result is interesting\n",
    "\nWhether you are new to dating, widowed or divorced and starting to date again, or in your 50th year of marriage - you will be able to gleam something from this book that will impact your life in a positive way.\n\nIdeally - you could read this book before you embark upon the \"dating chapter\" of your life.  But, even if you\u0027re not new to dating, this book can make an amazing and positive impact in many ways - it can increase your chances of finding the right person, reduce your chances of being hurt by or hurting someone (emotionally) during the dating process, and help you avoid scaring away someone with whom, otherwise, you could end up having a wonderful relationship.\n\nI especially recommend this to women who are in a relationship (or, who are thinking that they \"thought they were\") with a man who seems to have changed all of a sudden.  If you are questioning things like, where did he go? why didn\u0027t he call?  why does he seem so distant now?  what did I do wrong? - you are possibly at a point in the relationship where your choice of actions can make or break a relationship that might just be on the edge of going somewhere.  And, likewise, I recommend this to men who feel that they\u0027ve come to a point in their relationship where they all of a sudden \"aren\u0027t sure\" anymore, are feeling anxious or maybe even \"trapped\", and at the same time there is a strong need to just get away and think and/or if the woman you are dating seems to have become more insecure, worries more, questions you more, starts pressuring you more about commitment, etc.  All of these situations, emotions, etc. are explained in this book.  You\u0027re not the only one - it\u0027s a normal part of dating - but, unfortunately, most of us won\u0027t possibly be able to understand this without someone else pointing it out to us - like Gray has done in this book.\n\nEven if you are married - this book opens your eyes to many things and can really improve your level of understanding with your wife/husband.\n\nIf you are the perfect mate in a perfect relationship - you may not realize some of the problems other people experience and therefore, could probably benefit from this book by being able to better identify with friends, family, children when they come to you for advice\n",
    "\nI came into this book expecting one thing. After the first part, Perhaps an Accident, my expectations had completely altered. As I read through the second part, Marquesa de Montemeyor, my expectations were slowly changing even more. By the beginning of the third part, Esteban, my expectations had transformed so much they were hardly recognizable. \n\nI came into it expecting a novel about a man of religion\u0027s struggle with faith. By the first few pages I came to realize it had much more of a non-fiction lean, at this point I was scared of being bored. As I started to read part two I began to realize it wasn\u0027t about this Brother Juniper at all but the people in the accident. Throughout parts of the first chapter I have to admit I did feel bored, but near the end it caught fire and I was wowed by the first part\u0027s finish. This reinvested my firm belief that the ending of a short story will completely redeem it, for that\u0027s what each part was: a short story telling the complete life of one of the victims in the accident of the bridge.\n\nThe story of Thornton Wilder\u0027s Pulitzer Prize winner is that a bridge (the finest bridge in all of Peru) snapped and five travelers fell to their death. Brother Jupiter decided to use this accident to prove that it was God\u0027s will. This man found it more difficult than he expected discovering an ambiguity in life that he had not seen. Basically the novel to me is detailing the complexity and mystery of life.\n\nI would say the way The Bridge of San Luis Rey was written was, generally, not exceptionally appealing to me. It was told almost exactly like a textbook account of the events. Using this method though, there were dazzling moments when the book flowed like poetry. \n\nThe book also seemed slightly tedious at times. Certain sections were difficult to get through but as I pressed on I felt a certain gratification, in knowing that I was being shown snapshots of life that were almost as real as they get. \n\nDespite these downfalls (which had their upshots as well), the meaning of the book made it for me. The characters were all taken on spiritual journeys and though each story ended in death, which was a death too early for all of them, there was a certain bittersweet happiness in their soulful accomplishments. \n\nIn total I would suggest the Bridge of San Luis Rey but only if you\u0027re willing to fully concentrate whenever you pick this book up. It can be a beautiful book but only if first acknowledged as a tough book\n",

    "\nThe boom Mr. Dent speaks of HAS begun-but is starting in the population centers of the Far East and is being partially digitally controlled by companies here in America.  The boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers.  Since so many of our publicly-traded companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations, they are using that cost-savings in order to finance the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley.  The net effect is that Sarbanes-Oxley is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of U.S. publicly-traded companies.  This is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets.  Large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws.  So the industries that will expand will primarily focus around:\n\n1.  Baby Boomer spending\n2.  Competitive advantage exports \n",

    "\nYou probably know Joel Siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on Good Morning America.  But do you know the rest of the story?  Here\u0027s a chance to find out.\n\nMr. Siegel became a father for the first time at age 54, and his son, Dylan, was born on the day Mr. Siegel finished chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.  That cancer later spread to his lungs, and two more cancer surgeries and treatments followed.  Mr. Siegel\u0027s marriage did not last, but his love for Dylan did.  Realizing that his chances of living to see Dylan grow up are limited, Mr. Siegel decided to write down all of the wonderful things he wanted to share with Dylan over the next few decades . . . but might not be able to.  The result is a touching memoir with a heart that will cause you to shed more than an occasional tear while appreciating Mr. Siegel\u0027s love for his son.\n\nMr. Siegel writes well, has had many interesting experiences, and retains his sense of wonder.  He is open about many of his faults (which have led to failed marriages), but remains cautiously optimistic . . . and careful.\n\nDedicating the material to his son makes the memoir more personal and meaningful than almost any other memoir that I have read.  Anyone with an open heart would enjoy and benefit from this book.\n\nIf you are like me, you expected to mainly hear about the movies . . . and you will.  But there\u0027s much more in the book about Mr. Siegel\u0027s family, Jewish heritage (there\u0027s even a Yiddish dictionary with hilarious definitions), illnesses, past marriages, and advice for Dylan.  The show business stories are almost all ones that I had not heard before, and will reward those who are primarily looking for this feature.  Although you might think these are only about the movies, he also was a music critic and got to know the Beatles in the early days.\n\nI was particularly interested by Mr. Siegel\u0027s first-hand accounts of working for civil rights in the South, helping with Bobbie Kennedy\u0027s campaign, and how he helped his wife, Jane, with her fatal illness.  \n\nOne of the thoughts you will have as you read this book is how you would write a parallel one for either your children or your grandchildren to play the same role in sharing knowledge and love across the generations.  I hope you will read this book and feel inspired to either transmit your own lessons in your own way . . . or to create the book you want to share with your descendants.  \n\nIn any case, keep a hanky handy!\n",
    "\nHow does she do it? \nThis will forever be one of my favorite books.

It always seemed as though there were morsels of goodness somewhere to be found. A profoundly inspiring book. I only hope I can be as resourceful and resilient\n",
    "\nWilson doesn\u0027t spend two paragraphs explaining how the snow clung to the trees.  He tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life.  You get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire.  It\u0027s scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost Germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds.  When he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite, you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow.  \n\t\nIt\u0027s amazing that Wilson could write such a detailed history forty years after the events occurred, but maybe even more amazing that he doesn\u0027t embellish the situations.  There is little reflection on an event because he\u0027s off describing the next firefight or lost buddy.  \n\nThe most frustrating parts of the book were seeing raw officers replacing fallen soldiers rather than promoting the battle proven officers in the field.  It was not only unfair, but unsafe and yet the bigwigs away from the fighting didn\u0027t know the difference.   \n\nThe title refers to a commander who told Wilson before he went into battle that he\u0027d be promoted if he survived.  The promotions were slower coming than his successes and yet the war is such a long way away from this retired insurance salesman that he doesn\u0027t seem that upset about his treatment.  It turned out to be the experience of his life. \n",
    "\nMy hat\u0027s off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review. It is beyond anything I\u0027ve ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines. Unlike the embedded journalists of our own time, the writers and photographers who covered Vietnam were much closer to being free agents, restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of America\u0027s military presence in southeast Asia (\"There it is . . .), while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself.\n\nUnable to remain objective or even conceive of objectivity, Herr and his colleagues yield to a kind of hallucinatory experience, depicting the war as a phantasmagoria, a really bad trip that also seduced them with what one of them insists is a compelling glamour. To read this book is to experience Vietnam not as a historical record or analysis, or even a personal memoir, but as a kind of hypnotic nightmare from which many, including survivors, never wake\n",
    "\nIn 2003 I suffered my worst major depression ever. It lasted for over a year, and in the worst moments -which lasted months- my anguish was so intense that I wished I were dead. Again, the worst part was when I couldn\u0027t even get a full night\u0027s rest, and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. full of despair, unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief, and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching... Having to get up in the morning was hell. Needless to say I couldn\u0027t work, and that increased my ill-feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four (we have two adolescent kids). \nReading Andrew Solomon\u0027s book, which I found recommended at depression-blog at blogspot dot com was an extraordinary experience, because for the first time ever I found my own reflected on the written page by a gifted writer who has also suffered the extreme anguish and pain of major depression.\nIn my illness, I found that psychiatrists, doctors and other therapists who haven\u0027t themselves gone through the hellish nightmare of a major depression simply cannot understand what it is like. It\u0027s just like what happens with someone who has never eaten an orange: no matter how much you you try to explain how it tastes, the other person will have no real understanding unless he/she eats one him/herself. Same with friends and well-wishers of many sorts, who will tell you things like \"Cheer up!\" or \"Make an effort!\" without realizing that that\u0027s precisely what you would most want to do -but can\u0027t. \nSolomon\u0027s book and the advise of Mike S. -now a friend, and the guy who created the depression-blog at blogspot dot com- have been of great value to me. And of course the courage and love of my wife, who never -even in the worst moments, when we both thought I might die at any moment- abandoned hope, sustaining me, putting up with a lot, holding me when I cried in utmost despair and wished I were dead as the only relief in the midst of what now I recall as the worst kind of torture a human being can be subjected to...\nAnd my kids, too, who at times even made me laugh with a joke or helped me get some sleep with a massage. And God, who in the midst of utter darkness and despair, was there too, and saw me through\n",
    "\nWhen considering the faith of the founders of the U.S, it is easy to rely on half-truths and assumptions.  David Holmes dispels a lot of myths in his well-researched book which uses historical documentation, personal letters, and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused.  He begins by describing the religious movements of the 18th. century which influenced our founders.  One interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government-sponsored churches, a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation.  Although many of the people he describes, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson, were brought up in orthodox Christian churches, such as Episcopal and Congregational, they were later influenced by the Deist movement which opposed many orthodox Christian views.  He describes some interesting practices, such as the fact that George Washington would leave Anglican services before participating in communion, despite the fact that his wife Martha would stay for the sacrament.  This is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the Deist leanings of her husband.  Holmes concludes his book with a brief description of modern-day presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers\u0027 did.  In writing this book Holmes displays an impartiality which is fitting for an historian, and which makes it all the more believable\n",
    "\nThis volume contains entries that deal with concepts, events, persons, and movements in u.s. history. The length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered.

The entries are clearly written and eminently readable. They are persuasive in thier opionions, yet respectful of other stances. The cross references are helpful and ample.

    "\nAs a \"follower of Christ\" (Christian) who considers himself an Evangelical Protestant, this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart.  For all Christian believers, the richness and power of Brother Lawrence\u0027s life\u0027s witness and words are a fountain of Truth, a treasure that is as elegant (spiritually) as it is simple.  For the non-believers, I am afraid that reading this booklet (a spiritual treasure in disguise) will just confirm St. Paul the Apostles\u0027s words that \"the message of the cross is ... foolishness to the Gentiles\" (1 Corinthians. 1:18, 23 and 2:14).\n\nThe only way to do justice to this booklet is to quote from it and let you get a taste of it ...\n\nThis is a unique biography because it is not compiled by the Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (birth name Nicholas Herman but known by his monastic name) but by the ones around his life in 17th century France.  Thus one learns very little about the beginnings of his life but very much about his godly lifestyle in the last 30 years of life of bliss (presence of God in his heart) and suffering (3 physical and debilitating ailments). \n\nWe learn about this Spirit-filled vessel in God\u0027s vineyard - Brother Lawrence, by reading the Eulogy of the abbot of Lawrence\u0027s Christian community, 4 short notes of his conversations with his spiritual father - Abb? de Beaufort, 16 very short letters of spiritual advice and encouragement Brother Lawrence wrote to friends and seekers, a manuscript found at his death called \"Spiritual Maxims\" and a memoir of a leader in the church in France.\n\nThe followings are a selection of the many highlights and underlined phrases and sentences from this book:\n\n\"Busy yourself with keeping your mind in the presence of the Lord.\"\n\n\"My most normal habit is to simply keep my attention on God, and to be generally and lovingly aware of Him.\"\n\n\"I occupy myself solely with keeping my attention on God and by being generally and lovingly aware of Him.\"\n\n\"We have an infinitely good God who knows what we need.\"\n\n\"Console yourself with the One who keeps you fastened to the cross.\"\n\n\"We should love our friends, but without prejudicing the love of God which must be first.\"\n\n\"Think often about Him; worship Him without ceasing.  Life and die with Him.  This is the beautiful call in the life of a Christian.\"\n\n\"...we should love one another through our words of counsel and even more through our good examples.\"\n\n\"...our only business in this life is to please God. ... my little progress in the path of perfection.\"\n\n\"I applied myself to practicing the presence of God ... Doing this gave me such a high esteem for God that faith alone was capable of satisfying me.\"\n\n\"A devout woman told me that the spiritual life is a life of grace that begins with service fear, increases through the hope of eternal life, and is consumated by pure love.\"\n\nMY PRAYER: May we all experience God\u0027s love, which truly can consume all other passions, and be filled with His grace which will empower us to truly love our neighbors (Christian and non-Christian) as ourselves.

    "\nIt\u0027s pretty impressive to think that a book like \"Hiroshima\" was written, and appreciated, less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped.  John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age.\n\nInterviewing six survivors, Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city.  Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not.  The color of your clothing means everything.  White clothes reflect the heat, while dark clothing absorbs it.  Even if you survive the initial blast, what you see next might make you wish you hadn\u0027t.  But human beings are stubborn creatures, and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances.\n\nI have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times, and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal.  It is a humbling experience, and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes.  Hersey\u0027s book has a similar impact, being told in such a clinical, observational writing style that you can\u0027t help but be moved by the reality of it all.\n\nMy one criticism of \"Hiroshima\" is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase.  For some reason, they seem to be largely Christian, including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister.   With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population, considerably less than 1%, the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one.  Hersey is telling the largely-Christian US readers, \"See? They aren\u0027t heathen devils.  They are Christians, just like you and me.  That\u0027s who we dropped the bomb on. That\u0027s who we killed.\"   This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book, and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was\n",

    "\nThis item is a must-have for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS or Mormons for short).  While not an authentic artifact, it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of America\u0027s most successful and controversial social-religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.  \n\nThis reproduction allows the reader to read the original 19th century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of Joseph Smith (Author and Proprietor) to the pen(s) of his various scribes.  \n\nWhen the book is placed in it\u0027s historical context, the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current LDS Church as well as Smith\u0027s answers for many of the religious concerns of his day.  \n\nAlso, interestingly, when compared to the current version of the book and the LDS Church today, the reader can see the evolution of church doctrine over time.  \n\nFor Example:  \n\nThe development from a monotheistic doctrine of deity (see book of 1 Nephi and Mosiah - also see Lectures on Faith, also by Smith), to the current polytheistic doctrine that the church espouses (see current version of the Book of Mormon - changing of the text in 1 Nephi to correspond with current church doctrine).  \n\nThe original condemnation of polygamy (marriage to more than one wife at a time) with the exception of raising up a righteous posterity (see book of Jacob), to the open endorsement and practice of the same from the mid to late 19th century for no reason other than Smith saying that God commanded the practice, then to the abandonment of the practice in order to prevent Church property from being confiscated and to allow Utah statehood in the union.  \n\nThe condemnation of secret, oath-bound clandestine societies (see book of Helaman, 3 Nephi, Ether) to the practice of blood oaths of secrecy, loyalty and revenge (for the murder of Smith) in the Masonic-derived Nauvoo temple endowment.  \n\nThe original condemnation and futility of Baptism for children and those that die without the law (see book of Mormon - name of a section within the book), to the practice of performing all church ordinances (including baptism) vicariously for the dead (those that died without the law).  \n\nLike all religious/social/mass movements, the LDS Church will evolve and change to meet the needs of its members.  The importance of this book for any follower of the religion (or student of sociology, history, etc.) is to chart the origins of the institution and then follow it\u0027s metamorphosis over time as the institution attempts to adapt to a constantly changing and growing market.  For that reason alone the book receives 5 stars.\n",

    "\nI bought this book along with Saving Dinner and Saving Dinner for the Holidays last year.\n\nI LOVE the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping. We went through the entire book and I have to say, it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods. Also, the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance \"What\u0027s for dinner\" and be ready to prepare it.\n\nThe only cons I can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly, and you will need to be an open minded eater. If you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household, this may not be the book for you. Also, our grocery bill for two went up from about $75 a week to $125 because of the veggies and meats. Good, healthy quality food ingredients, but unfortunately, painful to the wallet.\n\nThat said, I have NEVER seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one, the food is good, the variety is there, and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond \"bunless burgers\" and eggs and bacon.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Leanne\u0027s Saving Dinner books. For the open minded foodie. Or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list. These books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress\n",
    "\nSo here is a collection of essays by Jonathan Franzen, the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001, The Corrections. Many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as Harper\u0027s and The New Yorker--so, readers should know what they\u0027re getting into. I read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of Franzen as a corporeal human being, and not just some exalted author of an award-winning novel. Overall, I liked most of the essays appearing in this collection. From the promising opener, in which Franzen poignantly recounts his father\u0027s slow descension into quietus from Alzheimer\u0027s, we progress to a quasi-portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in America, before Ashcroft and the Patriot Act invaded the American lexicon. Why Bother (which was previously referred to as The Harper\u0027s Essay) is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the 21st Century as a tool of social reform; the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform, but, should rather be written--ultimately-- for plain old entertainment value, Franzen seems to argue. \n Some of these essays seem to be a little discursive; Franzen evidentally has a lot to say, and seems to forget what the initial point of his arguments are, going off on long tangents; such as in Mr. Difficult, where as some other reviewer stated, he begins with an interesting exploration of his artistic need to be \"pretentious,\" but then slowly veers off into a history and ode to author William Gaddis.\n \n Franzen once again proves to be a smart and sophisticated reader and writer, and this book perfectly showcases his aptitude for social commentary, without pontificating or being too offensively forward. People may consider Franzen an \"elitist,\" but I consider him to posses a well-read, inquisitive mind; there are far too few Jonathan Franzens around these days\n",

I was not one of these people.\nAlso, The other stories in this book are not bad at all. I enjoyed The Happy Prince quite thoroughly. - *note this particular \"fairy tale\" was very reminiscent of Hans Christian Anderson\u0027s writings.\nTHE FLAW(S)! I blame the editor for this one -- this book, as far as I have been able to find, does not include the alternate(slightly more drawn-out) ending to this novel. I was, needless to say, a little upset by this missing detail.

It worked very well for giving an overview of the problems in just this interdisciplinary approach. A lot of examples are given and explained in an understandable way. There are some reduncancies but this helps for the understanding\n",
    "\nIronically, socialist, anti-American, iconoclastic Professor Taylor, could be, at least in this work, the inspiration for the great David Irving\u0027s more pathbreaking work on an unneccesary and destructive war.  It is demonstrated that Adolph Hitler, the popular Nationalist German leader, was no more responsible, and in many ways less so, than the so-called Allies, who foolishly guaranteed Poland, only to give her over to jewish Bolshevism at Yalta.  By refusing to grant Germany\u0027s rightful place as a continental power, Britain and France lost millions of lives, their world empires, and their economic prominence.  The sole beneficiaries of this needless conflict were the Soviets and their Western fellow travellers.  And upon the final dissolution of the evil empire, courtesy of one Dutch Reagan, we have a European continent completely dominated by...Germany\n",

Instead of the usual yada-yada, Corcodilos explains how a candidate can stand out in a sea of prospective employees clambering in a recruiting system designed to produce the status quo.\n\nOne hears a lot of complaints from hiring managers that effective, qualified employees are in short supply.  However, Corcodilos lays bare the true cause of this corporate angst:  The present recruiting system is broken.\n\nAsk the headhunter is worthwhile reading for both the candidate and the hiring manager; two agents who are in desperate need to meet\n",
    "\nI LOVED this story it was enriched with so many lessons, emotions, and detail that you felt like you were right there with Lous and Oz.  I would recommend this story to any one!!\n",
    "\nI really enjoyed this book.  It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it\u0027s definitely not fast paced.  I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.\n\nMr. Darcy is \"pride\" and Elizabeth Bennett is \"prejudice\".  These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves.  This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.\n\nI really like Mr. Darcy.  He is the perfect gentleman.  He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge.  He also doesn\u0027t retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn\u0027t do or that are misunderstood.\n\nElizabeth is also wonderful.  She is doubtful about people and quite cynical.  I really like that about her.  It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.\n\nMy favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly.  This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him.  Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself.  I would probably be charmed by him too!\n\nThis book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn\u0027t wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England\n",
    "\nI liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I didn\u0027t love it. The idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one I found appealing, but the plot was, at times, predictable. The setting was well-drawn, but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional. The clincher, though, is that I\u0027m not sure yet just how captivating Anna Pigeon is as a main character. I believe that this is her first story, so I don\u0027t want to make a snap judgement, but Anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple. That would be expecting a lot, I know, but frankly she isn\u0027t even as engaging as, say, Gideon Oliver or Sharon McCone or Brother Cadfael, and she lacks the depth and power of a Harry Bosch.\n\nAs I said, the jury is still out for me here. I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I wasn\u0027t wild about it. It\u0027s a solid first try, and I\u0027ll certainly read another Anna Pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series. I expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable. I recommend it, but my recommendation is a mild one\n",
    "\nExposure to Harv Eker\u0027s Millionaire Mind Intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago.  I also attended the Guerilla Business School, a $2500 intensive.\n\n  What is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually (as it did with me) shift your perspective, if you are at all open to having it shifted.  \n\n  Getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones.\n\n  This book may help you, but the seminar will help you more.\n\n  The Millionaire Mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me.   I am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called ZeroDollarMarketer dot com.  \n\n  Being rich is a matter of perspective.  True wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind, my relationships, and lastly my pocketbook.  But its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month.\n\n  A journey worth pursuing\n",
    "\nThis is one of my favorite books of all time, and during my 40 years of life I\u0027ve read a lot of them.  \n\nFirst off: the style is simple and direct - no big words and no long sentences. But this is by no means to imply that it is unsophisticated. As the product of a 19-20 year old mind, it impresses. It reads very much like a modern novel. This is the kind of novel you wish you could have written yourself - at any age, let alone 19 or 20. As such, it is remarkable.\n\nSecondly: the subject matter is disturbing yet something that must be taught. Educated people should know how easy it is to become a hypocrite when how one behaves is determined solely by how he believes the public will react. Matthew Lewis was not concerned about this. This is what makes him such a great writer. Too many contemporary authors are more motivated to write what they believe the public will like than what is in their hearts. Lewis\u0027 book created a sensation when it was published. He probably realized that he was writing a controversial book, but he believed strongly that what he had to say was the truth and that it should be said. After all, he was writing during the French Revolution, while the Reign of Terror was raging in Paris. People were just beginning to become disillusioned with Reason (because of what they felt it had led to in France), but had yet to become infatuated with sentimentality and passion (as they would during the Romantic era). As such, then, it was a time of transition. Lewis must have been aware of the danger (as he saw it) of people turning back (as they had during the Middle Ages) to Religion for answers in a time of such upheaval. He obviously felt that more Religion was not the answer, that too much Religion can pervert the mind just as too much Reason can. This is why his work is still relevant today. The battle over what role Religion is to play in society still rages today.\n\nThese are only a few thoughts I hope will be helpful to those who might consider reading this book. On the surface, the book is a delightful romp into a fantasy realm. Underneath, though, there is a deeper current which reflects the broader course of history and still resonates today\n",
    "\nAs one reads Peter Pan, one doesn\u0027t have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim.  I had ridiculously high expectations of Mr. Barrie\u0027s imagination before purchasing this title, and he has fulfilled them completely.\n\nMany parts of the story are nothing but nonsense, which I enjoy above all else.  Mr. Darling, the head of the Darling family, commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine he\u0027s supposed to take.  He brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs.  Unfortunately for him, during his bragging his medicine is found, and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three.  Sure enough, when three is reached, everyone except Mr. Darling takes their medicine, and Mr. Darling once again tries to hide his.\n\nThis kind of scenario is what I\u0027d call Mark Twain nonsense.  You can imagine it being true, even though it\u0027s quite high up on the ridiculous scale.  Then there\u0027s what I would classify as over-the-top nonsense - AKA bull - which there is plenty of in Barrie\u0027s original story of Peter Pan.  Going back to Mr. Darling, if we take a look at how he\u0027s doing near the end of the book, we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel.  Ah, yes...grown men in pet taxis.  What could be more fun than the \"he-didn\u0027t-even-try-to-make-this-belivable\" silliness of such a scene?  To be honest, I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this.\n\nOther silly parts of the book involve Wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls; the narrator claiming he hates Mrs. Darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later; the lost boys asking Wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it; the narrator using the phrase \"woke into life\" because Peter likes the word \"woke\" more than \"wakened;\" and my favorite, Captain Hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark.\n\nI believe the novel version of Peter Pan was written after the author had already established Peter Pan as a successful play.  That may explain a lot about the colorful narration, which takes many, many literary liberties.  We see everything from blatant narrator interference with the characters in the story to the shameless attempt at informing the audience that the narrator only chooses to make the events in the story happen a certain way so certain characters in the book won\u0027t be disappointed.  Perhaps without these wacky (and maybe even insane) traits in the narration, there\u0027d be no reason to read the book, since it would be no different from the play.  After reading the Peter Pan novel though, I\u0027d have to say it almost seems criminal to watch an adaptation of Peter Pan without any wacky narration.\n\nContrary to most adaptations of Peter Pan, the individual lost boys (of where there are six I believe) are actually more developed as characters than John or Michael Darling.  Heck, at the end of the book they actually end up moving out of the Neverland to live with the Darlings and grow up to busy themselves in interesting professions.\n\nI may not like the actual land of Neverland as much as I like the land of Oz, but Barrie\u0027s narration is unbeatable in my opinion.  He could probably make a Jeopardy contestant\u0027s Friday night schedule sound exciting.\n\nI believe Barrie has written another Peter Pan book as well, a prequel of sorts entitled \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.\"  It should be interesting, particuarly if it addresses what is contained in the dark dreams that haunt Peter throughout this book.  Freud would have a field day with such dreams and the whole mother issue.\n\nThe only thing I expected to see in this book that I didn\u0027t see was \"happy thoughts.\"  That must have been a creation of Disney\n",
    "\nI am nearly finished with this book - I haven\u0027t been this mesmerized by a book in forever! I would certainly recommend it\n",
    "\nHaving patronized Boulevard all but twice, I still feel the need to write a review.  You have to understand that those of us \"Back East\" think that California food is understated and so easy.   Now not being a huge chef myself, but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef\u0027s recipes (my fave restaurants being of course, Boulevard, and back east, 2941, Le Tire Bouchon, Maestro, Citronelle DC, Galileo, Inn at Little Washington, etc.).  I have no clue where I\u0027d get some of the ingredients in this cookbook, other than maybe the San Francisco Ferry building\u0027s fabulous farmer\u0027s market (another real SF treat!).  But to be real, we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients.  Do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised.  Now I was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at Boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and I have her handwriting -- just ingredients, no measurements.  And yes, I\u0027ve been able to improvise, and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of \"recipes.\"   But nothing is better than going to the restaurant.   Cookbooks are fab and fun, but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals (herselves) are even more exciting.  Buy this book even just for the photographs, as I\u0027ve never been in a more well-decorated and well-thought-out restaurant.  If only I didn\u0027t live on the East Coast!\n",
    "\n\nBusinesses cannot exist without the IT and vice-versa. They are interdependent. IT systems automate the business processes and run 24 by 7. Therefore we cannot really view those who work at the \"Business\" level as above us.  So, I disagree with the author on this point. However, he does sort of make a U turn later on in the book.\n\nThis book will make you think. For instance: What is the supply demand for programmers in a particular Business domain? This would be a good question to research so that we can plan our career.\n\nHe talks about how to survive layoffs by being knowledgeable in different areas. Not everyone wants to stay in one organization for a long time. Another thing is that it is almost impractical to learn everything in a particular technology (say, Java technology). Developers will have different intentions, for example they might have a backup plan in case of IT downturn, either by having a cash cushion or generating cash flow through software products.\n\nI agree about following your passion. It enables us to transcend limitations. It inspires us and makes us reach a level of performance that amazes us. This explains the previous paragraph (which sounds like excuses).\n\nAnother principle that he explains - \"Be the Worst\" is very real. Two projects, one early in my career where I had the opportunity to work with a strong and talented team of developers and project manager. Recently when I found working for people who were not anywhere near my capabilities, they did affect my performance.\n\nThis book helps to see and expect what the work environment could possibly bring us and what we can do to proactively handle these situations.\n\nMaintenance is seen as a menial work and recruiters downplay any experience on it. Oh, this is a developer job...  Chad advises you to learn to love maintenance. \n\nHe recommends having a mentor and I am glad I read his book. I know mentors can also come in the form of a book!!! You can have more than one mentor.\n\nI love the Eight-Hour Burn concept. This explains why I get very depressed and productivity drops during the last few weeks of the project. Now I know how to make the work stay in the office. No more nagging problems following me home!\n\nThe concept of \"Presence\" is very realistic. I learned this by making mistakes in the workplace and the cost was high. I wish I had read this book early in my career. Lot of things that he explains has already happened to me in my career. Still I was able to learn how to handle those situations successfully next time around.\n\nReading open source code really helps to solve recurring problems quickly. I have experienced this in my job. The cover of this book really needs to be improved. The content of the book is much better than the quality of cover image\n",
    "\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, this was an enjoyable read.  Since retiring Matthew Hope I guess EM had an urge to return to SW Florida with this tale.  Funny adult repartee and a good \u0026quot;mystery\u0026quot; but only age 9-12 reading level according to the Amazon rating??  These latest books from McBain are all very similar and are being churned out at almost a TV-episode rate, but how about trying to stretch a bit\n",
    "\nI have spent a lot of time and money researching into Mormon history. The big problem is that, as Henry Ford once said \"History is bunk\". With Joseph Smith and the history of the Mormon church, there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many, an ingenious charlatan. There are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide. Hence, using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of Joseph Smith can be a very frustrating (and sometimes expensive) exercise. The Church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony, but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony. It is easy to see from my statement above, why.\n\nThis book takes a completely different approach in investigating the truthfulness of what Joseph Smith produced. Forget about what might have happened in the early 1800\u0027s and instead, focus on the actual record contained in the Book of Mormon itself. Let current day investigation be the basis for the search of truth instead of historical personal accounts. This removes any bias of the source material and hence allows for an objective study.\n\nThomas Stuart Ferguson starts out as the Book of Mormon\u0027s most enthusiastic proponent. He sacrifices a large portion of his life both petitioning the First Presidency for financial support, and performing extensive archaeological expeditions to find evidence of the civilisations documented in the Book of Mormon (BofM). While he expects an abundance of material to be discovered, he finds none. Nothing. No evidence of the language or writings contained within the BofM, the animals and crops mentioned, artefacts, city names, weapons, metals, glass etc. Nothing for the period documented within the BofM (2500 BC - 400 AD). There are few discoveries outside this timeline, but none within. All he wanted (and expected) to find were actual artefacts or at least murals/pictorials showing the above documented items. \n\nThe turning point came when fragments of the Joseph Smith papyri were rediscovered in the late 1960\u0027s and found to contain nothing in common with The Book of Abraham. This is a completely separate quest in itself (see \"By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus\").\n\nWhile Ferguson may have lost his faith, he never left the LDS church and continued to attend and support it - he even sent a son on a mission. He believed the Mormon church was \"the best fraternity on earth\". In public, he was a \"normal\" member, in private circles he believed Joseph Smith was a fraud and as a result, spent the remainder of his life researching why.\n\nThis book is both a document detailing Ferguson\u0027s quest for the truth, and his way of dealing with it from the result.\n",
    "\nI call this one \"Frank Peretti Lite.\"  It was very entertaining but not a deep as his previous books.  Instead of focusing on sin and spiritual warfare, this one had a creationist angle.  I really enjoyed it, just not the same as his other books.  Also, you have to remember that this is fiction.  Of course the scenario is highly unlikely if not impossible.  But the central point about mutations comes through.  Great summer read\n",
    "\nI haven\u0027t had a chance to read the book in its entirity, but have enjoyed what I have read.\n",
    "\nThis book was originally conceived of and designed in the manner of an illuminated manuscript.  The images are combined with the text to convey meaning.  In the paperback most of the images are gone and the ones remaining are converted to black and white and shoved into the middle of the book where they lose their context\n",
    "\n   One reviewer of this book said he\u0027s sick of investing tomes, they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors, who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients. \n\n   And of course those firms charge hefty fees, even if their timing is slightly off (say, a few years or so).\n\n   Another reviewer loved the book because he realizes he is going to have to work harder to invest successfully over coming years. If only he had read the book in 1999.\n\n   What is not fully understood by many investors is that the money game is run by Wall Streeters with whom you cannot compete and beat over time. Some of the smartest people in the world work on the Street and they are not sharing what they know with anybody. But they want you in the game. They need you. They take care of their biggest clients (and I mean really big) and every client who is not big is late to the table and last to leave, usually at a loss. Because smaller clients start buying what the big players are just starting to sell. Which is why the big holders sell in dribs and drabs over time. Every winning trade requires a losing trade. Too bad, past results are no etc. etc.\n\n   Try to work the market independently against the big guns and you will eventually come to know the meaning of whipsaw. And its consequences. Everybody thinks they can get out in time. Trouble is, when markets tank--stock market, real estate markets--there is no getting out because there are no buyers. It\u0027s a free fall without a parachute. Many real estate speculators will learn this in the coming year.   \n\n   The author of this book, Ed Eastering, is well respected and can give you a good view of how the game works. Which is useful in a textbook kind of way. And he attempts to lay out some tips for the solo investor. \n\n   Trouble is, timing IS everything and the information you need to time the market is not going to be found in any book. Or any proprietary system being peddled over the internet. If it worked that well they would not be selling it to you.\n\n   So what\u0027s the answer? \n \n   Contrarian investing? When everybody is long, go short, and vice versa? Good idea but it requires a discipline that can tear apart the innards of a veteran Wall Street trader. It is just not wired into the systems of most people to pull it off. And reliable sell signals are about as hard to find as a legitimate 1918 Inverted Jenny. \n\n   Another possibility: do what most of the really rich usually do, stuff it into long-term U.S. Treasuries that pay a fixed interest rate and guarantee the principal at maturity. Of course, you have to keep them for the long term, which the really rich can afford to do. Can you? If not, you may sell the bond at a loss that negates the interest you were paid. So you\u0027re stuck with safe U.S. short-term notes which mature at par and pay the promised (usually much lower) interest rate. Not very exciting.\n\n   And if inflation pops your interest rate may give you breakeven or less. Well, that\u0027s tough unless you had the cojones to buy one of the most volatile commodities in existence: gold. This is a truly ferocious trap that has ruined many. \n\n   The big guns say don\u0027t speculate with money you can\u0027t afford to lose. Hey, thanks. That fits about .001 percent of the investing population.\n\n   Read Easterling for the historical big picture. And it ain\u0027t a pretty picture. It\u0027s all about volatility and volatility is a killer. \n\n   And so the moral of the story may be to be very careful with your investment decisions. Err on the side of caution. The first consideration of the physician is Do No Harm. The first consideration of the financial investor is Lose Not Thy Wad. \n\n   Of couse there is the notion that markets investing is really just another excuse to excerise the gambling urge for people who consider casinos crass. If that\u0027s you, may luck truly be with you. \n      \n   \n  \n",

    "\nIn the 1970\u0027s, Peter Singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics; animal liberation.  \n\nWhile some philosophers and others had in the past, argued for the necessity of being kind to animals (Schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for Buddhism), Peter Singer was probably the first philosopher in Western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals.  \n\nSinger\u0027s primary argument, and a very interesting one, is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals, particularly in the structures of our vital organs, nervous systems and brains.  Singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering.  \n\nOn these grounds Singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights, at least when they are being used by humans.  The fact animals can suffer means we can\u0027t just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use, but we need to consider them as fellow beings.  \n\nSinger builds up a set of arguments against eating animals, using animals in agricultural contexts, using animals for scientific experimentation, or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products.  Singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge, including the use of \u0027rape racks\u0027 and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments.  At the end of the book, Singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example.\n\nSinger\u0027s work has been very powerful in its influence, and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work.  However, others have criticized his arguments quite strongly, on many grounds.  It has also become a kind of manifesto for many animal rights campaigners and animal liberationists, some of whom have resorted to violent means to \u0027free\u0027 animals from scientific experimentation.\n\nWhile I admire Singer\u0027s rigorous arguments as well as the formidable evidence he marshals to back it, I cannot entirely agree with them.  It seems that at least some scientific research involving animals is necessary for fighting many awful diseases and conditions which cause terrible human suffering.  I think a total ban on animal research, especially medical research and biotechnology research aimed at improving human health, is excessive.  \n\nAnimals also form an essential part of the livelihood of many people around the world.  No doubt in many cases some practices lead to animals suffering, but does this mean all useage of animals in agriculture should be stopped?  Where do we make changes?  When do we make them?  I certainly agree agriculture should be done in such a way animal cruelty is removed, and suffering reduced as much as possible, but preventing all suffering is impossible, and reality will require compromise.  \n\nAlso as another ecologist remarked, sometimes practices which cause harm to an individual animal is necessary to protect the overall ecosystem.  Hunting rabbits and kangeroos or cats or horses will cause suffering to these creatures, but is often a necessity in Australia where in many areas these animals are dangerous pests that ruin the native environment through overpopulation or hunting.  \n\nStill, the strongest thing in favour of Singer\u0027s thesis is that we do share a profound connection with nature, and our terrible disregard for the biosphere is coming back to haunt us in the form of mass extinctions of species.  We certainly need to redevelop a sense of what Edmund Wilson calls \u0027biophilia\u0027, a sense of affinity with nature and the natural world, rather than simply seeing it as another object to gratify our desires\n",

    "\nI\u0027m a little late in reading this book.  I am trying to pace myself between the movies and the books so that I can enjoy a little Harry Potter at least every year.  \n  I think Goblet of Fire is the best in the series, so naturally it would be pretty difficult for Phoenix to live up to that standard.  In Goblet, it feels like Rowling had a fantastic ending in mind, and that drove the writing of the story.  In Phoenix, it seems like the story is key and the ending was simply tacked on to round it out and provide some concluding information.  The major theme seemed to be the Ministry\u0027s takeover of Hogwarts.  I found that entire thread to be thoroughly engrossing.  Harry\u0027s dreams, however, took on sub-plot status, and then rose to the top for the final conflict.  \n  I didn\u0027t mind the length of the book, but it did seem to drag in a couple of places.  The gang spent too much time at Grimmauld Place.  I could have also done without Hagrid\u0027s giant story.  \n  My biggest problem with the book was Dumbledore\u0027s secrecy.  Good stories have real roadblocks to keep the hero from achieving his/her goal.  In Phoenix, the cause for most of the confusion was that Dumbledore was reluctant to share certain information with Harry.  He explains his behavior in a most unconvincing way in the final pages.  The secrecy was necessary for the story to take the course that it did, but it lacked good motivation and left me feeling let down.  It reminded me of the natural disaster movie template where the world could be easily saved if not for an arrogant bureaucrat who refuses to listen to the young upstart with all the answers.  It is contrived conflict that is hardly believable.\n  Don\u0027t get me wrong.  I love the Harry Potter series.  And, perhaps my expectations have risen too high.

    "\nThere is about as much additional science in Social Intelligence, compared to Emotional Intelligence, as you could write on a postcard : mirror neurones and spindle cells.   Nevertheless, we can be thankful that Daniel Goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way.  Firstly, it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness, which is goodness.  Secondly, it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format.  Note that this already existed in Emotional Intelligence, but was not so clearly called out.  \nThe most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fMRI studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of inter-personal relationships to psychic ecology.  A question-mark would be against the reliance on Seligman\u0027s and Csikszentmihalyi\u0027s questionnaire based results.

    "\nCarl Hiaasen, who pens a weekly column for The Miami Herald, certainly follows the adage \"Write what you know.\" While he occasionally covers nationally significant events, Hiaasen generally confines his writings to the fertile territory that is the state of Florida. Readers of Hiaasen\u0027s columns know well his passions and viewpoints. His sarcastic commentaries often take aim at such topics as the medical profession, land developers, crooked politicians, gun aficionados, tobacco companies, madcap theme parks and the destruction of Florida\u0027s environment. But weekly newspaper pieces are not the end of Hiaasen\u0027s caustic observations --- they are only the beginning. In 10 novels written over a span of 20 years, Hiaasen has expanded upon all of these topics in hilarious tales that poke fun at every aspect of life in the Sunshine State.\n\nNATURE GIRL is Hiaasen\u0027s 11th novel. While he skewers many familiar targets, there are a few new objects of ridicule for his skillful and entertaining writing. Hiaasen\u0027s Florida romps all share common traits: quirky plots, countless screwball characters and an irreverent style that creates laughter on every page. The prime target for his ire in NATURE GIRL is Boyd Shreave, a telemarketer pitching Florida real estate who places a sales call to Honey Santana, thereby setting in motion a chain of events familiar to any Hiaasen aficionado. Anyone who has experienced the pain of a telemarketing call interrupting a quiet and peaceful evening at home can identify with Santana\u0027s plot of revenge. She turns the tables on Shreave and lures the unsuspecting pitchman to Florida for a phony tour of nonexistent Florida property.\n\nNATURE GIRL begins with an event not uncommon in a Hiaasen novel: someone dies and someone else tries to dispose of the body. Sammy Tigertail, a fugitive half-breed Seminole, takes a tourist out on his airboat. The tourist is frightened by a harmless water snake and dies of an apparent heart attack. Panic-stricken, Sammy decides to ditch the body somewhere in the Ten Thousand Islands area of Southeast Florida. The cast of characters, as often occurs in a Hiaasen novel, expands exponentially. Shreave has a wife intent on divorce, along with a girlfriend who accompanies Shreave on his ostensible Florida vacation. Eugenie Fonda once achieved fame as the girlfriend of a tabloid murderer.\n\nWhile Santana is obsessed with her plot to destroy Shreave, she must also fend off the advances of a stalker known only to readers as Mr. Piejack and her drug-running former husband Perry. Add to the mix one Florida State co-ed who falls in love with Sammy Tigertail and a private investigator hired by Shreave\u0027s wife to follow him on his tryst with Eugenie, and the pieces to a puzzle that create a picture of hilarity are almost all in place.\n\nCarl Hiaasen is a genius in creating mayhem on the pages of his novels. Characters move in all directions across Florida, and readers may often have difficulty keeping track of their various escapades. In the end, however, everything comes together in a typical Hiaasen conclusion. NATURE GIRL is pure Hiaasen, and his many readers once again will experience the joy of his humor and his easily recognized and human characters.\n\n   --- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffma\n",
    "\nExcellent, realistic, practical advice.  As parent of a very strong-willed two-year old, I continually found myself in a power struggle with him over EVERYTHING!  After reading this book in a couple of hours, I immediately began implementing the techniques (which are very common sense and SIMPLE), and now, just a couple of months later, I have a totally different relationship with my little boy.  I no longer feel like I am controlling him all the time, he is happily independent in ways we are both comfortable with.  This book really changed my life.  BTW, I had previously read the original Love and Logic for older children, which I liked, but it recommended spanking for children under 3.  This did NOT help!!!!!

    "\nJohn Tyree is a soldier first, a man second. Or so he thinks until he meets Savannah Lynn Curtis. While on leave, he falls desperately in love with Savannah, the proverbial girl of his dreams. Sweet, intelligent, and giving, John knows he\u0027ll always carry her torch.\n\nWhen September 11 changes the world, John is no exception. Moved by patriotic loyalty, he chooses to \"re-up\" in the army, adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to Savannah. More promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father.\n\nThis is the story of how an ideal love can falter, despite its purity and strength. Not every romance results in a happy ending, but with a great deal of luck, those who don\u0027t survive will find meaning from the experience. Love, loyalty, friendship--all those sentiments are great, but to what cost? And how does this make a good man great? This is John\u0027s journey to that understanding.\n\nIt goes without saying that Nicholas Sparks is one of today\u0027s \"master\" storytellers. Part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists. Such is the case in DEAR JOHN. Sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components--well-crafted setting, high emotion, obstacles, resolution--then breaks it. It is from the sadness that hope emerges, and John Tyree, although still quite young, gains wisdom that will last a lifetime. Sorrow will be a large part of this, yes, but there is room for something more, something that will reach beyond the pages and touch John\u0027s tomorrow in a way only he will see.\n\nWhile this works, there is something lacking. It is one of those hard-to-define qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding. Maybe it\u0027s the heavy reliance on John\u0027s soldiering as an excuse for certain behaviors. Or perhaps it has more to do with aspects relating to John\u0027s relationship with his father, who appears to have Asperger\u0027s syndrome.\n\nI\u0027m giving DEAR JOHN 4-Books for a beautiful story, but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper.\n\nReviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer\n11/22/2006\n",
    "\nDale Carnegie is one of the authors I have admired for so long. There are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one. He deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it. Of course, there are many negative people who don\u0027t like this book because they see everything in black and white. Carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate, positive and humane approach to everyone around you. It comes very close to \"treat the others as you want them to treat you\". I am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book, the world will be a better place. I am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people. Some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important. His viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. After all genius things are usually simple. Carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples. I liked that the book is practical, easy and fun to read, and most of all that it delivers great value. I can not say the same for many other books. Definitely get a copy especially if you are a \"good\" person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity\n",
    "\nJared Diamond has an ambitious goal: explain the history of mankind globally.\nHis thesis is quite simple: different people had different histories because of geographical (environmental), not innate (racial) differences. He presents, develops and defends his point of view brilliantly and forcefully.\n\nSome people remained hunters-gatherers, while others became masters of the world.\nThe crucial factor in human history is food. The availability of materials (plants, animals) for domestication leads to the production of food surpluses in some geographical fertile regions, which allowed the feeding of specialists outside agriculture (craftsmen, warriors, bureaucrats, priests, kings). Intensive food production, population size and societal complexity stimulated each other as fewer peasants were needed to feed the whole population. Craftsmen developed maritime, military and industrial technology and warriors conquered new territories.\nPopulation growth generated a centralized organization (a state structure) for decision making (politics) and conflict resolutions (law).\nDomestication provided other cardinal advantages. Infectious diseases evolve from animal diseases. Through intimacy with animals people became immune. But, when not immunized populations came in contact with immunized, they were wiped out. Also, animals could be used as power engines and warrior transport means.\nOther important historical factors were those related to transmission of acquired knowledge: migration and, cardinally, writing.\n\nWhile hunter-gatherer groups remained more or less egalitarian, states with centralized governments generated great differences of wealth. They became ruled by elite which controlled nearly wholly (kleptocracy) or partially the manna of the state (the budget).\nBut, how could the elite continue to control the masses?\nJared Diamond sees 4 different solutions: arm the elite and disarm the masses, redistribution of wealth, impose public order and curb violence (police), construct ideology or religion to justify the kleptocracy.\nThe author remarks judiciously that with the organization of the state the irrational beliefs of the population became institutionalized into an `official\u0027 religion.\n\nAll in all, Jared Diamond\u0027s book is a magisterial and very revealing Darwinian essay about power problems and survival of the human species.\nA must read for all those interested in the history of mankind.\n",

    "\nBarrow, an astronomer at the University of Sussex when this book was published, provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics.  Do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics?  What \u0027reality\u0027 do mathematical entities like pi have?  What accounts for what physicist Eugene Wigner has called, in a now-famous paper, \u0026quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\u0026quot; (299)?  After an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers, Barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism, inventionism, intuitionism, and platonism, a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor.  Perhaps most mathematical workers follow what Alfred Korzybski called \u0026quot;the \u0027christian science\u0027 school of mathematics, which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific\u0027 activities\u0026quot; (Science and Sanity 748).  I commend Barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly.  Barrow\u0027s discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations.  As for Barrow\u0027s conclusions, from a non-aristotelian view, the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification, the confusion of orders of abstracting.  Barrow doesn\u0027t seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics.  He seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him.  As Korzybski pointed out, we live in a world of multi-dimensional, ordered structures or relations.  It does not seem unreasonable, then, that we can map this world with an exact language of relations, i.e., mathematics.  But as Korzybski also pointed out many times, \u0026quot;the map is not the territory.\u0026quot\n",

    "\nI have been a fan of Larry Gonick`s work for years ever since I first stumbled onto his Cartoon Guide to Statistics.  He covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically.  Innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line.  It was this historical approach that made Carl Sagan\u0027s Cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science.\n\nI have long said that we teach science backward.  We still teach on a 19th Century model.  We start with biology, then chemistry, and finally physics.\n\nEven when I was in high school, I wished that I could take physics before chemistry.  Before I was elected as a school board director, I was on our district\u0027s Gifted Advisory Council.  I made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and, then, biology last.  I was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics.  So why not teach the math along with the science?  Integrate it.  (No, that would make it too relevant.)\n\nI felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a Nobel laureate making the same assertion that I had been making for years-we teach science backwards.  After all, the toughest course out there is biochemistry-at least that is what every med student I know has ever said.  And biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster innovations-nano-technology not being the least of these frontiers.\n\nGonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first, because in this book on chemistry, he introduces quantum mechanics, which is normally taught as physics, on page 28.\n\nDon\u0027t let he word \"cartoon\" in Larry Gonick`s books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved.  He makes each subject accessible while being entertaining, but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject.\n\nSo when I needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping, it took me about thirty seconds to find my book.  I went right to Larry Gonick\n",

    "\nThe original publication of _The Lives of John Lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria.  Much of it emanated from Yoko Ono, who likened Goldman\u0027s book to \"being punched in the face.\"  Yoko is a close friend of Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, which duly ran an article attempting to discredit Goldman\u0027s book.  Some of Lennon\u0027s fans took this behavior in and assumed that _The Lives of John Lennon_ was forbidden; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty.  \n\nNow, however, the dust has settled, and _The Lives of John Lennon_ holds up beautifully.  Each contention of Goldman\u0027s which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands.  Remember the ridiculous panic over Goldman\u0027s portrait of Lennon as a heavy drug user?  That drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew Lennon, including Ono and Lennon\u0027s first wife, Cynthia Powell.  The same is true about Goldman\u0027s claims about Lennon\u0027s tendency towards violence (a tendency Lennon himself owned up to in his Playboy interview).  And, while Ono and others acted agitated over Goldman\u0027s depiction of Lennon as bisexual, Ono herself is found to have said she considered John Lennon a \"closet fag\" in a 1981 interview.  (Why, then, was Ono so upset by the appearance of Goldman\u0027s book?  Because of what it reveals about her.)    \n     \nIt will be clear to anyone who approaches Goldman\u0027s book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ is not dishonest or flawed in any way.  A perusal at his \"Sources\" section reveals his awesome thoroghness.  Goldman bravely explored areas of Lennon\u0027s and Ono\u0027s lives that others shied away from out of deference to Ono, a worshipful attitude towards Lennon, and a reluctance to figure things out.  Albert Goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify Lennon, but for those with genuine interest in Lennon, it is indispensable.\n\n\n   \n",
    "\nMany reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports. I would agree as I have reporting experience with MS-Access and Crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly.  If you like learning in a step-by-step fashion right out of a book - this is the book!\n\nThe bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book.  While this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book.  For example,  one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book.  I would agree with that. I was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book. \n\nIf you want a better reference book try the WROX book, Professional SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services.  That book is not as good as this book from a step-by-step standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions.  For example, page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows - they call it Greenbar Reports.  It was not easy to find in this book either.  How many people would look up \"Greenbar Reports\" in the reference?  I was looking into \"shading alternative rows\".  I just happened to stumble upon it.\n\nI bought both books together.  Of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at Reporting Services.\n\nReporting Services could use a COOKBOOK-style text like they have for Access and other programming languages. Those types of books have served me well over the years. Until then this book and the WROX book should do the trick\n",
    "\nI am a Lutheran church librarian and I am glad I bought this very satisfactory book for our church library.  Its text stresses that children are the same the world over.  They have the same feelings and needs, and have the same hopes and dreams.  The illustrations are a nice change from the usual.  Each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded.  The illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor, drawn in Persian style.  The colors are very saturated.  The book\u0027s cover gives you an idea of what they look like.  The message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities, races, ethnicities, languages or faiths, they still have the same hopes, dreams and daily needs.  This is a very important message for children to hear in today\u0027s world where there is so much suspicion of those we \"perceive\" to be different.  The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere, the more tolerant they will be.  Children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age, say researchers, so you have to nip it in the bud very early, and this book does that in a wonderful way. \n",

    "\nAngels was the smallest college in Cambridge.  It was  built at the beginning of the 15th century.  Fairly had a fellowship.  St. Angelicus students had to find their own lodgings.  Fred Fairly had taken the science tripos and received a first class degree.  He came from a rectory and so his material wants were limited.  He was used to making do. At the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a Christian.  Fred knew the country was not a place of peace.  The Rectory had been built in 1830.  \n\nDaisy Saunders wanted to know how the human body worked and applied for nursing training.  She was seventeen and her mother had died recently and she was free to live away from home.  Daisy, now known as Saunders, was a probationer during her first year.  She was told to keep her eye on James Elder, an attempted suicide via the Thames.  It was January 1912.  To all the patients, except for the dying, food was of paramount importance.  Elder refused to eat.  The constable had said he was a gentleman.  He asked Daisy if the incident had appeared in the press.  For arranging for a notice about Elder\u0027s conduct in the newpaper, Daisy was dismissed.  \n\nFred Fairly and Daisy were in an accident with bicycles.  A Good Samaritan thought they were married to each other and put them to bed together in the spare room to regain their health.  Fred was enchanted and afterwards he looked everywhere to locate Daisy.  The kindness of the Wrayburns, the Samaritans, gave Daisy a place to stay in Cambridge.  She would do work in the house in exchange for room and board.  She had traveled to Cambridge to find work in a private hospital.  Happily Daisy was employed at the mental hospital and Fred found her again at the Wrayburns\u0027.  They went for a walk in the country.  Fred asked Daisy to marry him.  Mr. Wrayburn told Daisy that Fred could not be a junior fellow if he married.  \n\nIn the trial, pertaining to the accident, the journalist, who had accompanied Daisy to Cambridge, was able to identify the man who drove the horse cart wildly causing the accident.  When the heart is broken, efficiency is impaired.  There was some suggestion in the testimony of the journalist that Daisy had been or would have been used, but for the happening of the accident.  Daisy had to leave the Wrayburns and Cambridge because of what was disclosed in court.  Leaving her lodgings, she was free at last to cry over the hurt she had caused Fred.  Daisy and Fred passed each other on her way to the train station.  We do not know what action, if any, resulted.  \n\nBoth of the young characters are portrayed as having beautiful consciences.  The writing is elegant.      \n",
    "\nI am a photographer and a writer and the author of numerous books on photography and I have had a copy of the Sierra Club Engagement Calendar on my desk every day for more than 20 years. I find this calendar to be an inspiration in terms of both its beautiful photography and its wonderful geographic diversity. I\u0027ve never had a photo published in the Engagement book, but I\u0027ve probably gathered more inspiration and ideas from these little calendars than from the hundreds of how-to books in my office. \n\nThe photos in these engagement calendars are the cream of the cream of the crop of the world\u0027s best nature photography. Master photographers like the late Galen Rowell, who had many dozens of photos published here, consider it one of their finest showcases--and who can blame them. Sierra Club has never relented on the quality of the reproduction of these superb datebooks and considering there are more than 50 photos in each book, the price is a bargain.  \n\nI have used this calendar as a journal and a diary of my writing progress for, literally, decades. And whenever my brain starts to freeze after writing about photography for weeks on end and I need a new idea to write about, I simply flip through the calendars and I can discover hundreds of them in the work of many of the greatest modern nature-photography masters. Also, when I\u0027m looking for travel ideas, places to go to shoot new pictures for my books, I also look here for inspiration and ideas. The Mojave Desert, Monument Valley, the Everglades, the Sonoran desert--these are all places that I learned about in great detail from these datebooks. You learn more about a place by seeing great photos of it than you ever will by reading about it--or so I feel. (Of course, you learn a great deal more if you hop on an plane and go see it!)\n\nFinally, I gave my mother the engangement calendar for Christmas every year for around 20 years and she used them as a daily journal. I still have every one of those journals and they are a great joy to flip through and see what she was up to each day. \n\nWhy this long winded (and very sincere!) endorsement for such a simple product? Because I owe these caldendars (and the Sierra Club) a debt of gratitude for inspiring me day after day, year after year, with the greatest photography in the world. If you have a young photographer in your life, inspire them, show them how spectacular photographs of the natural world can be. For an investment of under $15 you can change their perceptions of nature and help educate them about fine photography. Someone gave me my first copy of this calendar many years ago and I\u0027ve been grateful ever since. \n\nOf course, I have to warn you, once you look at some of these photos you\u0027ll want to put your camera up on Ebay :)  But don\u0027t do it! Instead, use these photos as your photographic inspiration and your goal.   \n\nJeff Wignall\nAuthor, The Joy of Digital Photography (Lark Books\n",

Instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters. The reason: this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter.

Towards the later stages in the book I could also sense some cynicism in his words and he feels strongly about the lack of integrity, particularly in scientific research and life in general around him. \nA wonderful book that gives some insight into a brilliant mind and inspires to think while learning and not just memorize facts.\n",

If you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program, get this book before you try \"Advanced Organic Chemistry: Structure and Mechanisms\" by Carey and Sundberg. I expect that \"Modern Physcial Organic Chemistry\" will become a staple to most chemist\u0027s shelves similar to that of a CRC Handbook or \"Advanced Organic Chemistry\" by March.\n",

    "\nIf you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics. I started with Once-a-Month-cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary, but, though I loved it was a hard days work. Then came Jill Bond and she was really talking bulk cooking! When Deborah\u0027s first book came out I was excited because it fit in with my low-on-cash, short-on-time lifestyle. \n\nThis book is terrific because it provides a healthy alternative that is still pretty inexpensive. The meals are more than casserole and there are lots of options that are more appealing for the warmer weather when you don\u0027t want to heat up the kitchen.\n\nMy favorites are the Cheese and Chicken Shells (not for everyone however) Chicken Enchiladas (taste great made with homemade whole-wheat tortilla, if you do that), Crab rice Chowder (gourmet), Bean Casserole and everyone LOVES Spaghetti Pie. There are lots of good recipes in this book. \n\nThe drawbacks of this book is that after a few initial sessions I felt that I was more likely to choose some favorites than to use her already laid out sessions...that is okay, but, not as easy as using the shopping lists and plans.

It\u0027s also a way of introducing yourself to a variety of musicals\n",
    "\nThe Big Sky is not just a masterpiece, it\u0027s probably THE masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction.  This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isn\u0027t really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850.  The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature, partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in \"cowboy\" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways.  The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans, when actually nothing was further from the truth.  Cowboys were regular working stiffs, about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day.  They didn\u0027t consider themselves \"free\", nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day.  They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage, and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were, especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had.  But it was backbreaking work, and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years.\n\nI said all that to say that \"The Big Sky\" really is about freedom, and really is about the West.  It\u0027s about the true, wild, primitive west, before the plow, before roads, when there were still huge, intact Indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo.  So it\u0027s interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored, but I can see why - there are no set-piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no \"new sherriff in town\" characters, because there are no sherriffs, and no towns other than a few trading posts.  There is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those Indians.\n\nIf you don\u0027t already know, this is the story of Boone Caudill and his friend Jim Deakins, and several important side characters, but it\u0027s basically Boone\u0027s book.  He\u0027s driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom, and is pushed out by a brutal father.  He makes his way west to St. Louis, along the way befriending Deakins, in hopes of meeting his uncle Zeb who had become a trapper years earlier.  The rest of the tail is complex and interlaced, and not a simplistic good guy/bad guy plot at all, and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all, arching like the sky itself, is freedom.  Freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book.  Freedom is the religion, the politics, the philosophy, the recreation - it is everything that is important.  The trappers are there to trap - sure - but they\u0027re really there because this is a wild, free place, where they will not be hampered by rules, where they can be natural men.  It sounds over romanticized, but it really did happen that way, and from what we know, that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence.  Despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns, Boone cries \"Lord, Jim - remember the Tetons standing proud in the sun, and the Seeds Ke Dee...don\u0027t you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save Injun?\"  This novel makes you sob like few I\u0027ve ever read.  The sense of loss, the closing of an age of the world, hangs in the air like mist.  They are going to be the last to see something so precious, and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement.\n\nThe movie \"The Mountain Men\" with Charleton Heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book, and you can tell it\u0027s inspired in many ways by it, but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel.  \"Jeremiah Johnson\" is another good film, with many fine touches.  But if you want to follow the water up stream, back to its source in the mountains, then please, before you grow too old, read \"The Big Sky\" and open your heart to that time and place and the wild, brazen beauty of the America few Americans know ever existed\n",
    "\nThis is a great compliment to the more project-based MAKE magazine, as it focuses a little more on the personalities of the \"makers.\" Of course, it also describes (and shows, in beautiful photographs), their projects, but it\u0027s a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers, bored brainiacs, and fringe-worthy souls who are the heart of the newest form of the DIY geek culture: creating incredible, real-world projects, from the mega (a home built submarine for 3) to the micro, (a diy bat detector), to the whimsical (a Lego blocks project that will solve the Rubik\u0027s Cube).\n\nIf you\u0027re a vociferous reader of Slashdot, you may have seen some of these projects before, but the book really gets into the motivation behind them. \n\nProduction values, writing, and design are superb, and of course, URLs are provided so you can find out more on the makers\u0027 sites.\n\nBottom line, this fascinating survery of Make culture (and cool projects) is a must for every geek\u0027s coffee table, and it\u0027s also a great way to introduce your mom into what it is you actually do with your spare time..\n",

    "\nPeter Watson, holding a number of research degrees, offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the 20th century in this book.  Not being an easy read, it takes some time to get through.  \n\nThe main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the 20th century in its economic and social context.  This is quite an achievement, considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics.\n\nWatson tends to cover science the best, and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of 20th century science, including the theories of relativity, quantum mechanics, scientific cosmology, evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene.  However, the book falls down in some parts where it covers philosophy.  Watson dismisses Husserl\u0027s Phenomenology as \u0027abstract\u0027 and of little importance, when in fact Phenomenology was probably the most important philosophical school in the 20th century along with analytical philosophy, founded by Russell and Wittgeinstein, and attracted so many leading European minds to philosophy in a time when science was at its zenith of glory.  \n\nOverall though, Watson\u0027s work is a very important attempt to see where we are in what we know, and where we are going. \n",

    "\nHaving worked with VBScript for a little over four years I am by no means an expert; however, I feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting. I was pretty skeptical when I saw the word \"Advanced\" in the title, but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters.\n\nThe book begins with securing (including digital certs and policies) and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in WMI and ADSI. For me personally, the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with WSF and WSC files. Don and Jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind XML functionality as well as it\u0027s application within the scripted files. These guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies. They wrap up the package peice with explanations around HTA\u0027s and form controls in HTML scripts.\n\nThe book moves on to cover topics such as ADSI and ADO scripting, working with WshController and remote scripts, WMI and WQL classes and techniques, and different applicable real world examples. All this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug, sign, and package your scripts as well the wizards (WMI, ADSI, WSF, etc) and other tools available to make scripting easier.\n\nI\u0027ve obtained quite a few VBScript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced VBScripting. If you are new to scripting with VBScript, you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods, properties, classes, etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use. While this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics, you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it.\n\nThumbs up! Highly recommended bang for the buck\n",

    "\n_The New Taste of Chocolate_ has the beautiful pictures of a coffee table book, but it has a lot of academic substance and a lot of value to the reader.  \n\nThe main chapters are: \n - Growing Up with Cacao\n - A Natural and Cultural History of Chocolate\n - From Cacao to Chocolate\n - Identifying Cacao\n - Tasting Chocolate\n - Recipes\n\nThere is also a glossary, and a list of companies to order fine chocolate from.  \n\nFor a beginner like myself, who loved chocolate but hadn\u0027t progressed much beyond Hershey\u0027s with Almonds when I read the book, _The New Taste of Chocolate_ was very educational.  It explained the path from cacao bean to chocolate bar, and it also explained the difference between dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate.  It explained how cocoa powder comes from chocolate, why chocolate is so difficult to make candy with if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing, and why fancier recipes will sometimes specify chocolate manufacturer and cacao percentage.  \n\nIt was also quite interesting to read about the guidelines for tasting chocolate.  The discussion about criollo, forastero, and trinitario cacao plants was very fascinating from a scientific standpoint.  I later found that what is true for cacao trees is true for many other types of plants (including wheat): the plants that make the tastiest \u0026 highest quality edible parts are also the least productive and most delicate, so growers \u0026 breeders have to choose whether to grow something that will almost certainly produce a less-desired but still profitable crop, or to grow something that has an uncertain yield but is highly profitable should the plant actually produce anything. \n\nThe recipes were also interesting.  After reading this book, I became more adventurous in my chocolate-tasting and started trying some of the European imports I see in the local grocery stores.  My only regret is I am now knowledgeable enough and my tastes are spoiled enough that M\u0026Ms and Hersheys with Almonds seem pretty bland\n",

Their Snickerdoodle Cake uses a white cake mix, some other ingredients, and includes a Cinnamon Buttercream frosting recipe.  Yum!   I love the variety of recipes (bundts, bars, round, layered, etc.) and my kids and I can do many together.  I think the packaged cake mixes from the store have a nice taste, so these recipes just build on those mixes.

And there was in boxing too Barney Ross and Benny Leonard. \nPerhaps there are more up- to- date books about Jews in sports but I doubt there are any which tell a story as well, and give the young person such a warm feeling about the Jewish contribution to what seemed at that time of life, the most important form of human activity.\n",

    "\nI\u0027m a fan of Bill Myers work and have been since \"Blood of Heaven\". This one slipped by me somehow and when I saw it I immediately got it. While the plot is somewhat tight for the most part, I do have some problems with parts of it. For one thing, the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him (read the book to find out) shouldn\u0027t have any qualms about killing millions of others. So why is he so intent on the stones? But the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old. The minute anything happens, they\u0027re all screaming each other\u0027s names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it. For the first-time emergency, we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters, you\u0027ve got to have a break! \"Daniel!\" \"Tyler!\" \"Helen!\" \"Tyler!\" \"Daniel!\" \"Dad!\" \"Helen!\" \"Tyler!\" Give me a break!

    "\nThis book gives very good advice about managing behavior problems in difficult children. However, the concept of a \"strong-willed child\" is confusing because it implies a child with will power or self control. These difficult children actually have poor will power and self control. The techniques given in this book will help teach such children self control.\n\nIt is important to understand that the cause of the strong-willed child is an excessive drive for power over others. The strong willed child wants to be Captain and he wants everyone else including his parents to be a deck hand.  Parenting this type of child correctly, will help him learn to better control himself and respect others. However, he will likely never be the compliant child that some parents are hoping for.

    "\nJoe Pickett\u0027s daily life is not as enjoyable as it once was.  His wife now has a successful business and brings home a lot more money than he does, and there\u0027s still the temptations both of them thought about while Joe was away at Jackson hanging over their marriage.  His relationship with his fast growing up daughter Sheridan is not what it once was and his new boss is doing everything he can to make Joe\u0027s life a misery.  Throw in a civil war between Saddlestring\u0027s largest family and the appearance of, after along term behind bars bloodthirsty J. W. Keeley, who will not stop at anything until he has avenged his daughter\u0027s (Joe\u0027s stepdaughter\u0027s) death through the slow and torturous murder of Joe Pickett, and one way or another the era of Saddlestring\u0027s game warden is set to end.  \n\nC.J. Box\u0027s Joe Pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel.  The initial Open Season was a surreal not quite but almost Carl Hiaasen type novel, then Savage Run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure.  Trophy Hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and as many, I was glad when Out of Range returned this series to the traditional believable realistic type thriller, a style which continues with In Plain Sight.  \n\nI would strongly suggest reading these books in order, starting with Open Season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and In Plain Sight is certainly no exception to that.  It will be interesting to see if C.J. Box continues with the characters of this series in some form or another or if his next book will be a totally different kind of adventure.    \n",
    "\n  In Plain Sight offers an exceedingly thin plot and thin characters, but it is still an enjoyable read owin entirely to author C. J. Box\u0027s prowess at telling a story.\n\n  Saddlestring, Wyoming is enjoying the dawning of spring and, unsuprisingly for a police procedural, a possible murder.\n\n  Opal Scarlett, the grand and really mean old lady of Thunderhead Ranches, has disappeared and perhaps has been the victim of foul play. Tom Wayman, an alcoholic fishing guide, is brought in as a suspect. Opal, in violation of the law, charged Wayman and other boaters a fee for navigating the river that runs  through her land. She strung up razor wire across the river and the lazy sheriff thinks a drunken Wayman killed her when he tossed her into the river. Frankly, there\u0027s not a lot of excitement here.\n\n  Joe Pickett, Wyoming Game Warden, is dealing with a problematic new boss and his 14 year old daughter, Sheridan. Sheridan just happens to be the best friend of Jule Scarlett, daughter of Hank Scarlett, one of two brothers who might be heir to the big ranch. Of course, they can\u0027t find a will and the two brothers are smashing each other with shovels when Joe arrives to drop off Julie. Julie, it turns out, doesn\u0027t live with her father Hank. No, she lives with Opal\u0027s eldest son, Arlen, on his \"side\" of the ranch. There\u0027s a third brother, Wyatt, who is a bit on the weird side. The very weird side.\n\n  Enter J. W. Keely, a good old boy, who is on the run from Mississippi where he has murdered a couple. On his way to Wyoming to settle a personal vendetta against Joe Pickett, Keely murders a prisoner and then guns down a cowboy who did nothing more than get Keely angry. Again, not much here. Keely is not a convincing bad guy; more like a typed out description of a \"bad\" guy.\n\n  Under the name of Bill Monroe (which author Box reminds us several times is also the name of a famous country and western musician) goes to work for both of the Arlen brothers.\n\n  Golly gee: several nasty things happen at the Pickett household. Oh my, the FBI keeps inquiring into the whereabouts of  Nate Romanski (or something close to that spelling) who apparently figured largely in a previous novel. All this produces tension in the Pickett household, high job stress, arguments with best friends. Yawn. Just not a lot of excitement here either.\n\n  Finally comes the climax. Rain. Thunder. Floods. Pickett\u0027s daughers kidnapped! The truth comes out! Box tries for a surprise ending, but it\u0027s kind of like a wet firecracker.\n\n  All that said, \"In Plain Sight\" is still an enjoyable, if not particularly suspenseful, read. He has a strong writing style and does a nice job of weaving in a feel for Wyoming\u0027s people that is, in my opinion, stronger than the underlying story. This is the sixth of the Joe Pickett novels. I won\u0027t be going out of my way to read the older ones, but I will keep an eye out for anything new by Box. He\u0027s definitely a comer even if he hasn\u0027t arrived.\n\nJerr\n",

    "\nGrowing one\u0027s herbs is satisfying but using them completes the cycle. If you\u0027ve ever wondered what to do with all the herbs you\u0027ve managed to put in your garden over the years this book can help you. If you are just starting out with herbs this book can get you going properly. Not only does it have recipes but it has some ideas that I never could have imagined let alone used. The bulk of the book is dedicated to the herbal index which is extremely helpful. Each illustrated herb is broken down and expalined simply as to it\u0027s use, from root to leaves. The only problem I found with this section is that it is organized by their botanical names, which unless you\u0027re so inclined is difficult to find quickly. This is a minor problem that is remedied by the oversized common name, which of course is not alphabetized but more recognizable. A page is dedicated to over 100 of the most common herbs used. It tells you how to cultivate the individual herb and it\u0027s uses, which includes the medicinal use. Even if I don\u0027t use all the herbs or have them growing in my garden it is fascinating to know the historical and contemporary use of herbs. This book is a constant learning experience that can be read over and over. A perfect garden companion for that break under a tree. The knowledge can prove to be invaluable. Even such common herbs as Thyme can present posssibly new insights into it\u0027s benefits. Have trouble sleeping? The leaves of Thyme can help insomnia as well as stimulate the production of white corpusules to resist infection amongst it\u0027s many other attributes. There is much more information than I need here but there is something for everyone, from herbal dyes, to baths and massages and to the ever popular potpourri. This is, as the title suggests, the complete book on herbs. A great book for the kichen or to help you plan your herb garden, this book has as many uses as the author presents uses for the herbs\n",

    "\nI love to browse through different cookbooks.  I have quite a collection, and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before I decide to purchase the entire book.  I normally look for 3 things in a cookbook, besides delicious recipes that will work for my family.  This includes:\n1)  Pictures of more than 3/4 of the recipes (Color pictures are the best)\n2)  A spiral binding, or at least one that easily lays flat\n3)  New \u0026 innovative recipes that have ingredients I can easily find at a grocery store\n\nI also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium, fat content, protein, fiber, and carbohydrates.\n\nI picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal in-between working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events.  Let\u0027s face it, eating out isn\u0027t always the best for you, especially since you cannot always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting.  I wanted some new recipes to try, but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying \"what is it?\".  I was not disappointed.\n\nThe book offered many beautiful color photographs, and the pages themselves were glossy and thick...not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use.  All of the nutrient information was included, along with a column called \"Nutrient Bonus\" that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of Vitamin C, Calcium, etc.  The book was hard cover, but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat, another good bonus so that I was not always struggling to keep my page open.  It also contains a rather large vegetarian section.\n\nSome of our favorites include: Seafood Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette, Bistro Beef Salad, Vietnamese Style Beef \u0026 Noodle Broth, Mock Risotto, Chicken Stuffed with Golden Onions \u0026 Fontina, Almond Crusted Chicken Fingers, Beer-Battered Tilapia with Mango Salsa, and Loaded Twice Baked Potatoes.

    "\nTrotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.\n\nIn a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality, in a sense, it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. What Marxism aimed for, and Trotsky defends here, is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish. That is the thought that underpins Trotsky\u0027s work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. In short, Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness. \n\nYou will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. Quite the contrary. Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected (or not affected) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends. Mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends. He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature, like futurism and constructivism, and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive.\n\n The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here, however, was the fight against the proponents of `proletarian culture\u0027. The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement (read a monopoly on the literary front).  Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that, in theory at least as its turned out, the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting `proletarian culture\u0027 would have time to develop. Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development.\n\n\nOne of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals, particularly Western intellectuals, based some of their sympathy for Trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write. This was particularly true during the 1930\u0027s here in America where those who were anti-Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him. A few, like James T. Farrell (Studs Lonigan trilogy), did this mostly honorably. Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. Such is the nature of the political struggle.\n\nA note for the politically- inclined who read this book. Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin\u0027s death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution. Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time.     \n  \n",

    "\n\"GPU Gems 2\" edited by Matt Pharr (Addison-Wesley, 2005, ISBN 0-321-33559-7) is a collection of forty-eight white papers that detail cutting edge techniques based on today\u0027s latest graphical processing units (GPU).  The full color hardcover text is 784 pages and includes a CD-ROM with working demos and source for some of the articles presented in the book.  The text retails for $59.99.\n\nThe book is divided into six parts: geometric complexity, shading, high-quality rendering, general purpose computation on the GPU, image oriented computing, and numerical algorithms.  A part has anywhere from five to twelve chapters.  Each chapter is written by a different author but the format and style is consistent.  The chapters have an introduction, discussion of the problem or technique, conclusion, and references.  The material is presented with color illustrations and occasionally some pseudo-code or code fragments.  Generally, the material is extremely current and very approachable to read.\n\nAs a sequel to its well received predecessor, the text focuses on taking advantage of the computational power and features of today\u0027s high-powered GPU boards.  The first part of the book, geometric complexity, emphasizes this with chapters dedicated to batch rendering, using multi-streaming, hardware occlusion, and displacement pixel-shaders.  Each chapter illustrates how operations traditionally performed on the CPU can be moved into the GPU for efficiency and greater effect.\n\nThe subsequent two parts on shading and rendering continue along the same theme: improved performance by using hardware functionality found on the GPU.  Each topic considers the performance ramifications and GPU capabilities when discussing the problem domain of a rendering technique and factors it into the final solution.  For example, chapter 10 considers irradiance environment maps for fast lighting - but with a twist - using the GPU to do the calculations in real-time.  In doing so, the book\u0027s real value becomes apparent.\n\nThe fourth part on general purpose GPU computation is an interesting addition to the text.  The chapters illustrate methods of offloading traditional CPU tasks by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of modern GPU hardware.  Since the book features Nvidia hardware, the architecture and performance capabilities largely focused on their products.  \n\nIn the fifth part of the book, hardware assisted image creation and analysis is considered.  By using context clues from the spatial, texture, or lighting data - additional refinements can be made to a scene prior to rasterization.  The topics presented in this part are further refinements of the text\u0027s main theme (using the GPU fully) and are specific solutions to uncommon problems - or approaches to rasterization.  None the less as GPUs continue to evolve, the topics presented in this section will undoubtedly become more common.\n\nFinally, the sixth part of the book provides several non-traditional graphics examples to illustrate calculating data on the GPU: solving linear equations, options pricing, and numerical simulation - just to name a few. As using the raw floating point power of modern GPU is a growing trend - these sections were quite interesting and well done.\n\nThe included CD-ROM contains examples to 28 of the 48 articles in the book.  In most cases, the example material includes source code as well as pre-compiled binaries to help illustrate the topic presented in the text.   In order to run the majority of the samples, Cg must be installed on the host computer.  In addition, the CD-ROM provides access to Nvidia\u0027s software development kit, Cg toolkit, performance tools, and several helpful reference links to on-line sites.\n\nGPU Gems 2 provides a cutting edge view of the capabilities found in today\u0027s video cards.  The selected articles illustrate that every part of the rendering process can be enhanced in some fashion by fully using the underlying hardware.  As such, this book is essential to anyone working with modern GPUs.\n\n",

Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. Such is the nature of the political struggle.\n\nA note for the politically- inclined who read this book. Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin\u0027s death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution. Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time.     \n  \n",
    "\nI admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in \"Piece of My Heart.\" DI Stanley Chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock \u0027n roll concert. His teenage daughter has facts to hide and DI Chadwick walks a fine line. DCI Alan Banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder. \n\nThe plot has already been outlined, so I\u0027ll just say it\u0027s a delight to visit DCI Banks again.

    "\nEd Hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it doesn\u0027t do justice to the man himself. His dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them. Having shared some of his adventures but as a cop,I found that he loves cops. If it wasn\u0027t for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one.\n\nHis book covers his life and gives a glimpse into the man and his style. He doesn\u0027t know how to go at half speed and neither does the book. His upfront approach is evident. He just doesn\u0027t have time for B.S.\n\nIt\u0027s a quick read and an enjoyable one. Make sure that you take it with you on vacation! It will make it more enjoyable\n",
    "\nV. I. Lenin wrote this book in 1917, while he was hiding from the Russian government. Lenin pointed out that \"The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and of the social revolution to the state, like the question of revolution generally, was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914)\". He wanted to correct that oversight, and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book. \n\n\"The State and revolution\" is a very short book, well structured and not difficult to read at all. Initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters, but Lenin didn\u0027t conclude the seventh, due to the outbreak of the Russian revolution. In the postscript to the first edition he explains that, saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time, but that all the same \"It is more pleasant and useful to go through the `experience of revolution\u0027 than to write about it\".\n\nThe main idea in \"The State and revolution\" is that the State is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class (a \"special coercive force\" that rules through violence). The State of the bourgeoisie will disappear, but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat (the working class) will become then the ruling class, \"capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie, and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system. The proletariat needs state power, a centralized organization of force, an organization of violence, both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population -the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and semi-proletarians- in the work of organizing a socialist economy.\"\n\nThe dictatorship of the proletariat will be only a first stage in the path to Communism (\"Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state\"). According to Lenin, the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with the idea of the necessity of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of Marx and Engels. All throughout this book, Lenin cites and examines Marx and Engels\u0027 writings, in order to explain and support his own point of view.\n\nThe importance of Marxism for nowadays world has diminished enormously, but I advice you to read this book nonetheless. It is certainly not a grueling task, and it will allow you to understand better some notions that many Marxist leaders believed with all their hearts. Ideas drive men, and men make history. \"The State and revolution\" will help you to get acquainted with some of those ideas, and that is not a small feat.\n\nBelen Alcat  \n",

    "\nWow! This is a wonderful reference book not only for Taiji Jian (tai chi sword), but also for Taiji Quan. All sections of the book are straight forward and easy to follow. There wasn\u0027t any mystical \u0026quot;mumbo jumbo\u0026quot; I couldn\u0027t comprehend. The first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the Taiji jian, I particlularly liked this historical information. Chapter two is for Taiji jian and Tai Chi Quan practitioners. This chapter explains clearly the \u0026quot;ins and outs\u0026quot; of Taiji Quan and Taiji jian. The author explains basic trainning, principles, elements, etc. I found this section of great interest to me having only studied Taiji Quan for about a year now. I believe the information I\u0027ve gainned from reading this section will help improve my practice.I think advanced practitioners will find chapter two valuable as well. The remaining chapters 3-8 give the reader information on the parts of the jian, how to practce with the jian, basic movements,fighting principles, and a 32 posture form with pictures and detailed explanations. The explaination of each picture includes info about the key points, internal components and the movement itself. This is a great manual that I know I will refer to over and over again. This is a must read book for any Taiji Quan or Taiji jian practitioner\n",
    "\nThe Hellion Bride is the second book in Bride Series. I love Ryder and Sophie and the joy of meeting other characters from The Sherbrooke Bride. I kept turning the pages to find out their secrets. Deceptive and abusive uncle Theo as well as murder scenes make the story more thrilling and a suspense. The Virgin Bride also comes in handy and she is an angel rather than a ghost for she always is encouraging and very nice. Sinjun pleasantly spices up the whole story. I can\u0027t wait any longer to read her own story The Heiress Bride\n",
    "\nThis book is the best book on Rand\u0027s esthetics I\u0027ve ever read; in fact, it is the only book on the topic that I know of.  It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical; they are not slavish cultists  savoring every last word written by Rand.  They approach the material with  critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rand\u0027s work in the  larger history of esthetic theory.  They demolish abstract art, and devote  considerable energy to discussing Rand\u0027s definition of art.  They even  propose their own individual alternatives!   If anything shows  independence, it is this willingness to debate the differences between the  authors of the same work!  Remarkable!  The world of Rand commentary is  filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship.  That is clear just  by reading one of the reviews here, by people who are devotees of certain  \u0026quot;scholars\u0026quot; who do nothing but repeat the catechism.  They take  swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published; that is why  they hate this book.  Because it is independent-minded.  Judge for  yourself.  Don\u0027t be fooled\n",
    "\n\u0026quot;Good Sports\u0026quot; is a book which helps girls to be the \u0026quot;best athlete you can be.\u0026quot; It catagorizes players, parents, and other important people into real-life situations. It has quizes, quotes from  other athletes, and memory pages. Also, it offers a lot of web sites and  other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports. More  importantly, this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is  all about. One of my favorite parts in the book says: \u0026quot;Sometimes heart  is the strongest muscle.\u0026quot; This book also tells girls how to take good  care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete. It  includes the food pyramid and what one serving is. \u0026quot;Good Sports\u0026quot;  involves \u0026quot;Power Drills\u0026quot; and advice from other girls. It goes  inside the lives of other athletes, such as Michelle Kwan, but also shows  girls\u0027lives who are teens or pre-teens.  This book not only focuses on the  physical parts of playing a game, but on the mental part as well: keeping  your dreams alive even when you\u0027re at the bottom of the team, or you were  embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped. I would reccommend  \u0026quot;Good Sports\u0026quot; to any female athelete, whether you are experienced  or haven\u0027t even started yet. It teaches you the basics and also the mental  parts of a game! It has advice on keeping your mind and body strong, along  with being a good winner and loser. It has advice from other athletes,  famous or otherwise, memory pages to record your victories, dreams and  goals, and ways to reach sports associations. As the book says, it includes  \u0026quot;Winning. Losing. And everything in between.\u0026quot\n",
    "\n\nBarbara Ghazarian\u0027s book is a wonderful collection of recipes that originated in an ancient culture. I enjoyed reading about her family and how Armenian food remains a large part of the communal family experience. These foods from the Mediterranean region are exciting, flavorful, and easy to make. Barbara\u0027s emphasis on bulgur wheat -- a staple in the Armenian diet -- is particularly important, as this whole grain product has stood the test of time. It might even be considered the gold standard of healthy, easy-to-prepare grains.\n\nSimply Armenian gives Americans a way to incorporate whole grains, meats, and vegetables into a healthy meal that a family can share. While I read the book, a line kept running through my head: \"our grandmothers were right.\" They cooked with simple, whole foods that provided excellent nutrition and variety from recipes that were handed down from mother to daughter. Simply Armenian allows us to cook like our grandmothers and provide the same healthy choices for our modern families\n",
    "\nThis is a sci-fi novel about the end of the world.  Every single adult on the planet died.  THere are a couple of kids living in a house alone.  So begins the Fire-Us trilogy, fascinating, scary, and intriguing.\n\nThe story is really interesting - I mean slap in your face, give-me-more, I LOVE THIS intersting.  A couple of the images were really disturbing, though, like the fact that Hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket.  The kids in the story are fascinating, and the Teacher\u0027s scarpbook-thing was so . . . wierd that it was actually kind of scary.\n\nThen Angerman is introduced.  He\u0027s really messed up, but I get the idea that he knows something about the virus (Fire-us) that the others don\u0027t.  This makes him an amazing character, and even if you don\u0027t like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy.\n\nI really love this series, though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers.  Well worth anyone who is into sci-fi and apocalypse, as I was at the time.\n\n\n\nP.S. I read this book five months ago and I still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks.

    "\nWhen I read Ron Penton\u0027s first book, Data Structures for Game Programming, I couldn\u0027t wait to see what he did next. MUD Game Programming lived up to all of my expectations, and indeed surpassed them.\n\nThe author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable -- and, equally important, making them interesting. Reading MUD Game Programming is like having a friendly, cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade. Instead of just telling you what to do, he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a MUD server, enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project, which might not be the same. You end up with not just knowledge but understanding.\n\nI highly recommend MUD Game Programming to people doing any type of network-based multiplayer programming, not just traditional MUDs.

    "\nHACCP is the acronym for Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points. This text, by Arduser and Brown is the be all and end all on the topic - in my view.  It even comes with a companion CD-ROM that contains all forms from the book in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) and MS Word format. This is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired.\n\nThe comprehensive 530+ page text covers everything I can think of that relates to food safety in restaurants and other eateries. It is designed to teach food service managers and their employees the specifics of food safety in accordance with the FDA Food Code. This excellent training manual is in large print format that makes it easy to read. The writing is easy to understand and the authors were careful to explain key concepts and terms so that even a novice can study it alone.\n\nThe seven comprehensive chapters in the manual cover the following topics: Hazards to Food Safety; Factors Affecting Food-Born Illness; Food Safety Regulations; Following The Flow of Food; HACCP; and the Facility Plan. These are followed by an extremely helpful Glossary of terms. The Appendix includes all forms needed to meet the FDA requirements and to run an efficient and safe establishment. Included are checklists, signage, compliance checklists, and equipment cleaning charts, allergen-control program worksheet along with job descriptions for personnel. There is even a Certificate of Completion to certify that staff members have taken and passed the required tests (included).\n\nWith the rise in reports of food-borne illnesses and deaths it is essential that every food service operation adhere to the regulations and safety procedures at all times.  In my view, this book is essential to ensure you are in total compliance. \n\nAs one who has conducted training I find this book deserves 5 stars for its complete coverage of the subject matter in an easy to digest all-in-one format.  I highly recommend this book\n",

    "\nI studied the medieval Islamic world a little in college, and fell in love. It\u0027s a fascinating age in which Central Asian Buddhists, North African nomads, Ethiopian slaves, Greek cave-dwellers, Persian aristocrats, Arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together, mixed, wrote wonderful literature, and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun. But it\u0027s hard to find anything written about the time that isn\u0027t arcane professor babble or Islam 101. (You know, \"There are five pillars of Islam...\" Snore.)\n\nHere Hugh Kennedy has written the book I always wanted. He wisely concentrates on medieval Islam\u0027s golden age, the early Abbasid dynasty, when Baghdad ruled a large portion of the world-and, even more astutely, on the dramatic stories and personalities of the court. Let\u0027s face it, you read about the Abbasids because you want to know how the slave girl Khayzuran not only managed to marry the caliph but to quell a military revolt, why her son Harun al-Rashid was immortalized in The Arabian Nights, and why the all-powerful Barmakid family suddenly fell from grace to prison and execution. Kennedy brings the caliphs and their families to life. He\u0027s up front about the fact that the book is about aristocrats, but the common people of Baghdad, the \"pickpockets and sellers of cheap sweets\" who fought back when their city was besieged, and the middle class who developed Islamic tradition dance around the edge of the narrative.\n\nKennedy doesn\u0027t believe everything he reads, and doesn\u0027t think you will either. He repeats stories-like the \"harem intrigue\" tales, in which devious women are blamed for various deaths-that are almost certainly not true, but tell us something about the people who believed them, and are still enormously entertaining. He also is frank about the same-sex relationships, male and female, that were a part of the era\u0027s culture, without the awkwardness of many modern historians. And he\u0027s smart enough to explain the geography-why southern Iraq could support such a fabulously wealthy monarchy, and why the Afghanistan/NE Iran region was so critical to the faraway Middle East-in a way an American can understand. Very rare for books on Islamic history, the book boasts an excellent map, naming both cities and regions-invaluable for a hapless Westerner who doesn\u0027t know where the major cities of Iran are today, never mind where long-gone kingdoms like Yamama and Ushrusana used to be. There\u0027s also a surprisingly good index (another rarity).\n\nThe book isn\u0027t flawless. Kennedy twice awkwardly interrupts his straightforward account of political events with fascinating chapters on aspects of court culture-palaces, poetry, science, and (my favorite) women\u0027s lives. Unfortunately, this structure means the reader learns about the palace Mutawakkil built before she knows enough about him to care, and doesn\u0027t hear anything about Ma\u0027mun patronage of scientific research until long after he\u0027s dead in the main narrative. The last chapter goes into far too much detail about the depressing downfall of the dynasty, short-changing a more interesting discussion about its legacy. But all in all Kennedy does a great job, and I for one plan down to hunt down his earlier books.\n\nIf you know nothing about Islamic history and want an accessible introduction to an fascinating period, or like me know a little and want to learn more, I highly recommend this book\n",

    "\nIn this study Demos examines family life as it was for the Pilgrims who came over on the Mayflower, before they joined with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The book is in three main sections: the physical setting (housing, furnishings, and clothing); the structure of the household (family connections, including servants); and individual development (childhood, coming of age, and old age). The most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the Court: although laws were not draconian, they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly. Mess up and you would be punished. But it\u0027s also true that people were not that different back then, either: parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them; families were at the core of society\u0027s welfare; even women were given rights denied them in the mother country. It\u0027s interesting that even these first settlers saw the American continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized, and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from Plymouth itself, thus weakening communal ties. A highly recommended book\n",

    "\nAnna Anderson/ Anastasia\n\n \nI have researched this great mystery for some time now and I have concluded that the woman, Anna Anderson, could not have been an imposter. Not only did she never give any signs of playing a part, but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known. She knew of Gleb Botkin\u0027s paintings before he even came to see her, she knew exactly what she and her sister Tatiana had been doing while WWI was being declared for Russia (this was confirmed by Dr. Rudnev who was visiting Russia and saw Anastasia and Tatiana at that time), she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in Europe, and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone. One must wonder how a demented Polish farming girl could do that. Aside from just her character, there the many scars and lacerations on her body, as well as the bunions on her feet identical to Anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young Anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support Anna Anderson\u0027s claim. For over six decades, Royal cousins and friends to Anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks. They would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would. It is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake. Anna had people such as Alexei Volkov and Alexadra Tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched. No one has ever yet attempted to explain why Ambassador Zahle and Grand Duke Andrew\u0027s papers are still kept secret, why Doris Wingender touched up her photographs in court, or why Pierre Gilliard had his scandalous midnight \u0027burning\u0027 of evidence. To this day, anthropologists who compare Anna Anderson\u0027s face, ears, and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the \"two\" women are the same. \n   The Franziska Schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end. Anna Anderson was several inches shorter than Franziska Schanzkowska, wore a size shoe three inches smaller, was not mentally insane like Franziska, she spoke a bad German while FS spoke German as her first language, and could understand Russian. The Schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of Russian when spoken to them. AA clearly understood Russian. Anderson also gave birth to a child. There is no record of Franziska ever having a child. Recent documents also show that Schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on Anna Anderson\u0027s body. The DNA tests have won the hour, but I hope the future will see the release of Ambassador Zahle and GD Andrew\u0027s papers to cast even more doubt on this. Richard Schweitzer\u0027s switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with Schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at Martha Jefferson Hospital during the complicated court battle between Marina Botkin Schweitzer and the Russian Nobiltiy Association. According to Massie\u0027s book, one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time. Is it reasonable that the Royal families would ignore the fact that Anna Anderson was about to recieve recognition as the Tsar\u0027s daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life? \n   In any case, the body of Anastasia is still missing, although in Russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads \u0027Anastasia\u0027 measuring 5\u00277, despite the fact that Anastasia was the shortest of her sisters. If this isn\u0027t reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda, I don\u0027t know what is. I\u0027m afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over Castle Seeon under the stone which reads, \"Anastasia Manahan 1901-1984\". \n   To end this, I will quote Empress Alexandra\u0027s best friend (aside from Anna Vyrobouva) Lili Dehn, who met Anna Anderson in 1957(?) and declared, \"Don\u0027t bother to tell me she has read these things in books. I have recognized her physically and intuitively, through signs which do not decieve. What can I say after having known her? I could not have been mistaken.\"\n\nThis is to explain my conviction that Anna Anderson was Anastasia. I think there is something about the DNA we do not know. \n\nThe File on the Tsar- 2002 edition... p. 362 \n\n\u0027Nearly fifty years ago, Anna Anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in Tobolsk. She played a male part, she \u0027recalled\u0027, and and had to borrow a man\u0027s dressing-gown. At a pivotal moment in the play, a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs, revealing that she was wearing the tsar\u0027s long-johns- against the bitter cold of the Siberian winter. The family, said Anna Anderson, had hooted with laughter. \nThe only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene, and who are known to have survived, were the two family tutors-both foreigners. One was the English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975. They include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in Tobolsk. \n\"The cast,\" Gibbes wrote, \"had its happiest night with an Edwardian farce by Henry Grattan, called \u0027Packing Up\u0027, ... Anastasia took the male part... at the end of the farce the \u0027Husband\u0027 had to turn his back, open his Dressing-gown as if to take it off- Anastasia used an old one of mine... but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back, showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased Emperor Jaguer\u0027s underwear...\u0027 \nSo far as exhaustive research can establish, only Anna Anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote, in private and three decades before the Gibbes memoirs appeared. If Anderson was a phoney, as the seemingly damning DNA evidence now tells us, how did she know the story? \nThat was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in Anna Anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict. Ian Lilburn, a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the \"Anastasia\" appeal process in the German courts, had a calmer response than some. \"I think,\" he said, knowing he sounded like a Luddite and Romanov flat-earther, \" there is something we don\u0027t know about the DNA.\" \n\n\nMaybe after reading you can understand why some of us don\u0027t believe the DNA was Anna Anderson\u0027s, and why we don\u0027t believe she was the tall, size \u002736 shoe wearing Franziska Schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter.\n\n\n",
    "\nIt\u0027s been around two years since I first read this book, and i must say i reference it to people all the time.  the reason: it is so darn fascinating.  i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data.  if i gave you an 8-track tape right now, would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it?  younger folks might not know what it is.  they would recognize tape (maybe), but 100 years from now, how many players would be around?  the book talks about a project the author was on.  a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans (or others) in the future that the site is radioactive.  since the radiation could last 10,000 years, the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now.  what would the message be like?  if you read the book you\u0027ll find out!  lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just couldn\u0027t put the book down.  buy it, have fun\n",

    "\nThings are going swimmingly in Fish! land. In the latest volume, Fish! Tales, authors Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen, Harry Paul and Philip Strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first Fish book. Tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center; a hospital neural-renal unit, a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish! theories effectively. They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish! function. The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun, seek to serve others, stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive. Along the way, the authors heavily sell their Fish! courses and merchandise - that\u0027s just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section, showing ways to apply these principles in any organization. The lively writing style helps keep you hooked. We suggest that if you haven\u0027t yet caught any Fish!, start with this one. Its cheery, accessible methods should lure you in, hook, line and sinker\n",
    "\nWhile some may think that good work should be \"readable and enjoyable,\"  great work is meant to elevate us. Stun us, amaze us, fill us with wonder.  Otherwise, See Spot Run would be a masterpiece.  \n\nWilliam Faulkner is a writer the likes of which we may never see again.  He is not only brilliant of word but of concept.  He creates a picture not only by text, but by context and form.  In many ways, his works sculpt.  How else would we see things from the vistas of the characters, especially those who can\u0027t speak but by setting and demonstration?\n\nOne reviewer cursed his conveyance of emotion by \"using big words.\"  Writing is the art of language interplay, the use of beautiful and succinct language.  Faulkner uses language that most of us have never heard of but when we take the time to look up that language, the effect is stunning and makes the experience all the more worth it.\n\n \n",
    "\nThe Reviewers above and below warn that the novel is difficult to read.  If you a person of average intelligence, all you need is a character list and a careful reading and you will have absolutely no problem finding your way through the greatest novel ever written.  (It\u0027s an incredibly easy read the second time around.)  \n\nThe Sound and the Fury is a summation of Faulkner\u0027s works.  Everything that is done in the rest of his novels was first done in The Sound and the Fury.  The Sound and the Fury is poignant and tragic.  It is monumental in its mythical power.  It is Southern and yet it is universal.  It is Faulkner\u0027s triumph as a novelist.  It is a study of human consciousness, perception, and existence.  The novel follows the decline and eventual fall of the Compson family.  In Faulkner\u0027s world of Yoknapatawpha County, the Compsons and Sartorises, the Sutpens and de Spains, in other words, the established old families of Jefferson declined as the invasive and unethical Snopes, portraits of the modern businessman, ascended to power.  The story is an intimate portrayal of the Compsons, and yet it is a symbolic and mythical account of decline and tragedy.  Why is it the greatest novel ever written?  It takes the innovations in narrative technique as developed by Joyce and Woolf in the movements of European Modernism (which it does better and with more purpose than Joyce and Woolf) and combines them with an exploration of storytelling and an intense devotion to a portrayal of place and region.  The story is great and moving.  The characters are loveable, hateable, tragic, and intensely vivid.  The place is conceived and presented with taxing reality.  The language, as with all of Faulkner\u0027s novels, is at times soaring and at times quite terse.  The structure is perfectly balanced and symbolically paired with the passion of Christ (the three days are Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday).  In short, it is the paradigmatic example of what literature can (and should) do; even the greatest of literary feats stand in its shadow\n",
    "\nWhile on maternity leave from Cambridge University and with her husband away handling a legal matter in Los Angeles, Professor Cassandra James meets her neighbor actress Melissa Meadows and her spouse Keith Kingleigh.  Melissa and Cassandra share an affinity since both recently gave birth prematurely.  Kevin is going to direct a production starring Melissa.  He asks Cassandra to adapt the Victorian drama East Lynn, which she agrees to do.\n\nAs opening night beckons, Cassandra notices the cast seems extra nervous.  Later an anxious Melissa calls Cassandra believing that someone is stalking her.  Cassandra tries to calm her down.  The next day Melissa fails to appear for a rehearsal so Cassandra goes to visit her.  Melissa is gone without a word, but abandoned her six month old baby that she had shown so much love.  With her own fussy infant at her side, Cassandra wonders what happened to her new friend while unable to contact Stephen, dealing with the abrupt arrival of her first husband, and Detective Sergeant Vickers suspecting the professor killed the actress.\n\nSTAGE FRIGHT, the second Professor James tale (see MURDER IS ACADEMIC), is a fabulous amateur sleuth mystery that builds up the suspense slowly so that the reader like the heroine suspects everyone\u0027s motives.  Either foul play occurred or Melissa had played the role of a loving mother, but Cassandra cannot find a motive for either scenario while the evidence points towards her so that even the audience will believe she harmed or murdered the actress.  This is a fantastic English mystery in the Christie tradition.\n\nHarriet Klausner\n",

    "\nPeople were looking for a book that could grab them about Nam when this was a best seller in 1972, and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days.  Magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of Nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in Nam itself as a primary consideration.  Portions of this book originally appeared in `The New Yorker,\u0027 so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared.  Frances FitzGerald\u0027s original trip to Vietnam was in February to November of 1966, and resulted in articles for the `Atlantic Monthly,\u0027 the `Village Voice,\u0027 `Vogue,\u0027 etc.  People who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like Nam, where large numbers of young Americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion.\n\nThis book is not perfect.  The only listing for `Tonkin Gulf Resolution\u0027 in the index is for the page on which President Johnson\u0027s use of the Resolution is questioned by Senator Fulbright in 1966.  That was the time this book is mainly concerned with, but it gives an enormous amount of background information.  It is possible to find a listing in the index under ` GVN\u0027 for `and U.S. entry into the war, 354\u0027 which gives the page that reflects Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara\u0027s testimony to Congress that:\n\n\"It was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by GVN forces that North Vietnamese PT boats attacked the U.S. destroyer Maddox, mistaking it for one of the South Vietnamese vessels.\"  (pp. 352-353).\n\nActually, the OPLAN 34A attacks along the Gulf of Tonkin coastline were operations planned and approved in Washington, D.C., and McNamara lied about South Vietnamese operations to maintain the secret status of U.S. operations, during which the North Vietnamese PT boats were responding to recoilless rifle fire from a small boat when American intelligence informed the Maddox that it was about to be attacked.  Radio intercepts of North Vietnamese naval messages on August 4, 1964, were used to convince LBJ and Senators that an attack had occurred when two American destroyers were picking up radar ghosts and sonar readings off the reflection of a hard-turned rudder, as shown by subsequent tests.  Edwin E. Moise\u0027s book, TONKIN GULF AND THE ESCALATION OF THE VIETNAM WAR has much more information about that secret circus stunt.\n\nJeffrey Kimball\u0027s recent book, THE VIETNAM WAR FILES:  UNCOVERING THE SECRET HISTORY OF NIXON-ERA STRATEGY, contains a reference to the author of this book in a Memorandum by Dwight Chapin to Haldeman, January 18, 1973, about a month after heavy bombing near or in Hanoi to get some ceasefire agreement signed, hoping it could be called `The Peace Announcement\u0027 (p. 288) and attempting to describe a point of view different from what intellectuals were expecting.\n\n\"The FitzGeralds and the Fondas, the Halberstams and Harrimans, the Clarks and Ellsbergs and Baezes are poised in the wings just waiting to treat the end of the war as their victory and to so opine from coast to coast.\"  (Kimball, p. 291).\n\nI have the First Vintage Books Edition, August 1973, which was after Dwight Chapin\u0027s Memorandum, but I am not sure if American bombing in Cambodia had ended when the actual paper in this book was printed on.  There are only six lines of listings in the index for Cambodia, mostly on general issues, but the week I spent there was hardly earth-shaking.  Of more interest to me was the report in FIRE IN THE LAKE about the An Lao valley, where the battalion 1/12th Infantry from the 4th Infantry Division spent the months from September, 1969 to January, 1970.  I believe this was our first free fire zone, with a base high above a village that had been destroyed, surrounded by paddies in which elephant grass was growing instead of rice, but enemy soldiers were found harvesting highland rice on the hillsides.  Enemy contact was the only kind we had, after all other possibilities had been eliminated in the manner described in this book.\n\n\"In Operation Masher/White Wing alone--a multi-regimental sweep through the north of Binh Dinh province--the Allied forces, by the estimates, destroyed an entire enemy division.  In the process they left hundreds of civilians dead and wounded and `generated\u0027 so many refugees as almost to depopulate the fertile An Loa valley.\"  (p. 405).\n\n\"While the American troops opened roads and `cleared\u0027 great stretches of territory, the Front guerrillas came back into every area except those heavily garrisoned by U.S. troops.  By the end of 1966 the NLF continued to govern the An Lao valley as well as the suburbs of Da Nang, Hue, Nha Trang, and Saigon.\"  (p. 406).\n\nThere is only one line in the index for Frantz Fanon, but anyone who is interested in how FitzGerald saw a link between revolution against colonial powers in African and Arab countries and the situation in Nam, \"including the belief in Fate and the symbolic killing of self, which he called `the behavior patterns of avoidance. . . . the sudden crime waves that spread through the cities, the tribal warfare, and the fierce, irrational feuding of the native sects.  As he explained them, . . .\"  (p.509).  You wouldn\u0027t want to believe how true the stuff in this book could be today\n",

    "\nThose interested in American art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book. Chicago and New York are the centers from which Katharine Kuh radiated. As a museum curator, art dealer, and published critic, she was personally close to many of the modern masters. In this book, she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives. I especially liked the chapters on Rothko, Tobey and Noguchi.\n\nDisparate side characters, such as Judge Learned Hand and LBJ, pop up and add further to the value of Ms. Kuh\u0027s memoir.\n \nAvis Berman has done a great service to all those interested in the history of twentieth century American art by completing the memoirs of Katharine Kuh.

    "\nMost people are in awe of the \"classic.\" However, a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts, rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition. Classics do not only thrill and teach, they also live.\nThe Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a classic.\nThis tale of accusal, love, betrayal, imprisonment, redemption, and retribution, defies genre. \nRecounting the plot serves no purpose, so I will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward. Edmond Dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him; he expected to return to those who remained faithful. Here Dumas, using Dantes, Sinbad, Albert and Abbe Busoni, championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life.\nThe Count of Monte Cristo is a vivid potrayal of French life after the Revolution, an epic account of a man\u0027s quest for closure and an inspiration for the Shawshank Redemption. It is never too late to read it\n",
    "\n At 37, John Wade was Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota. At 40, he ran for the U.S. Senate. He was heavily favored to win. At 41, he wasn\u0027t just beaten in the primary, he was crushed --- \"loser by landslide.\"\n\nWhat happened?\n\nJohn Wade had a secret. As secrets will, it came out at the worst possible time. And, suddenly, he was no longer a rising star --- he was a war criminal, a killer of babies, a man to be shunned.\n\nHis secret was My Lai.\n\nThe Vietnam War is now so far from us, and American history --- especially the history of a war we lost --- is so sketchily taught, and some of you are so very young that I really ought to take a minute here and, in quick brushstrokes, relate what happened in a little Vietnam village on March 16, 1968.\n\nBetter idea: let Tim O\u0027Brien tell it. He arrived in Vietnam a year later, and served as a foot soldier there for a year. Got wounded, got traumatized, the whole deal. Here\u0027s his account:\n\nAt approximately 7:30 on the morning, a company of roughly 115 American soldiers was inserted by helicopter just outside the village of My Lai. They met no resistance. No enemy. No incoming fire. Still, for the next four hours, Charlie Company killed whatever could be killed. They killed chickens. They killed dogs and cattle. They killed people, too. Lots of people. Women, infants, teen-agers, old men. The United States Army\u0027s Criminal Investigation Division compiled a list of 343 fatalities and an independent Army inquiry led by Lieut. Gen. William R. Peers estimated that the death count may have exceeded 400. At the Son My Memorial, a large tablet lists 504 names. According to Col. William Wilson, one of the original Army investigators, \"The crimes visited on the inhabitants of Son My Village included individual and group acts of murder, rape, sodomy, maiming, assault on noncombatants and the mistreatment and killing of detainees.\"\n\nEventually, after a cover-up that lasted more than a year and after the massacre made nationwide headlines, the Army\u0027s Criminal Investigation Division produced sufficient evidence to charge 30 men with war crimes. Of these, only a single soldier --- First Lieut. William Laws Calley, Jr. --- was ever convicted or spent time in prison. Found guilty of the premeditated murder of \"not less than\" 22 civilians, Calley was sentenced to life at hard labor, but after legal appeals and sentence reductions, his ultimate jail time amounted to three days in a stockade and four and a half months in prison.\n\nTerrible, terrible. (And ironic: Seymour Hersh, who broke the My Lai story, now writes about the Iraq War for The New Yorker.) But in fiction, O\u0027Brien doesn\u0027t play judge and jury. John Wade may have been at My Lai and done terrible things there, but he found a way to live with his shame. And here\u0027s the remarkable thing --- Tim O\u0027Brien bends over backward to see it Wade\u0027s way.\n\nWhat I tell you now may seem like a plot \"spoiler.\" It\u0027s not. \"In the Lake of the Woods\" is a mystery --- maybe even a thriller --- but it\u0027s totally innovative in form. That is, we know right off that something happened. The first question is: What happened? And then a gloomier question: Who did it?\n\nWhat we know: After the primary defeat, John Wade and his wife Kathy retreat to a cabin in the Lake of the Woods, a part of Northern Minnesota so remote that there\u0027s nothing but water and islands between it and Canada. Thirty-six hours later, Kathy disappears.\n\nDid she flee?\n\nDid she drown?\n\nDid her husband --- reliving his Vietnam experience --- kill her and dump her body into the lake?\n\nNot easy questions. And O\u0027Brien doesn\u0027t answer them: \"I tried to make each hypothesis plausible. John may have killed Kathy. Or Kathy may have run off with someone else. Or maybe she simply drowned. Or got lost in that vast wilderness. I believed in each hypothesis as I wrote it. I inserted evidence to support each hypothesis --- just as life itself gives us contradictory evidence about a great many things. But in the end, it\u0027s all a mystery, insoluble, beyond certainty.\"\n\nAnd to make it more mysterious, O\u0027Brien tells the story from multiple perspectives. Offers testimony from many people. Cites historical documents. And then amps up the uncertainly by giving Wade a hobby --- magic.\n\nAnd maybe that\u0027s what it comes down to --- an ungainly kid, an abusive father, a need for approval that never got satisfied. As O\u0027Brien writes:\n\n\"A fat little kid doing magic in front of a stand-up mirror. \u0027Hey, kiddo, that\u0027s a good one,\u0027 his father could\u0027ve said, but for reasons unknown, reasons mysterious, the words never got spoken. He had wanted to be loved. And to be loved he had practiced deception. He had hidden the bad things. He had tricked up his own life. Only for love. Only to be loved.\"\n\nToo simple? A clue that takes you away from the solution? Could be: O\u0027Brien is that good. (He won the National Book Award for \"Going After Cacciato\". The New York Times named The Things They Carried as one of the best books of the year in 1990 --- and chose \"In the Lake of the Woods\" for that list four years later.)\n\nThis much is sure: You start \"In the Lake of the Woods\" expecting one kind of book and quickly get another, darker, scarier book. You find yourself thinking \"God, this is awful,\" even as you read faster and faster. You cringe at what Wade might have done, wince for what might have been done to him. And, as he comes apart, so do you.\n\nThis is a harrowing book, as grown-up as it gets. It\u0027s a great story, masterfully told. And more: It draws you in, demands your opinion. And then it demands your honest opinion --- because you have your secrets too, don\u0027t you\n",

    "\nThe Gospel of Judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame. It is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the Christian faith. Like its many predecessors, it gave National Geographic and anti-Christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of Jesus. A book titled The Gospel of Judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly, shot straight back down. Still, while its popularity was short-lived, it allowed Bart Ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of Christ. Surely Ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered, \"(The Gospel of Judas) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century. It rivals the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Gnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi.\"\n\nNational Geographic describes the importance of the document in this way: \"The Gospel of Judas gives a different view of the relationship between Jesus and Judas, offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed Jesus. Unlike the accounts in the canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, in which Judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor, this newly discovered Gospel portrays Judas as acting at Jesus\u0027 request when he hands Jesus over to the authorities.\" A classically dualistic, gnostic document, The Gospel of Judas presents a Jesus who is seeking to escape from the corruption of this physical world and asks Judas to betray Him so He can be free of this wickedness. Judas complies and shows himself to be a hero, rather than a villain. No longer the betrayer, He is a faithful friend to Jesus Christ.\n\nRenowned New Testament scholar N.T. Wright is the first Christian to my knowledge to write a thorough refutation of the teachings of The Gospel of Judas. Judas and the Gospel of Jesus is due for publication in October of 2006 and will be published by Baker Books. It is a short book, weighing in at only 144 pages, but provides a thorough treatment of the subject matter.\n\nWright is fair to this newly published document. He does not say that there is no value in The Gospel of Judas for surely there is, for it tells us much about the gnosticism that was a great opponent of early Christianity. It gives historians access to an authentic, original document. But it tells us nothing about the real Jesus and the real Judas. Those who would have us believe that this letter provides details about the real life of the real Jesus can be little more than revisionists. Wright shows that such people believe in what he calls \"the new myth of Christian origins.\" This myth, popularized by men such as Bart Ehrman, has three main teachings: first, Jesus was not as the canonical gospels portray Him; second, there were a great many different varieties of early Christianity, and they produced a large number of different \"gospels,\" all of which circulated among Christians more or less unchecked; third, when Christianity became consolidated in the fourth century, many teachings about the \"true\" Christian faith were rejected.\n\n\"Classic Christianity,\" he says, \"has a lot more life and promise than have ever been imagined by those who propose the new Myth, or by those who offer newly discovered gnostic texts as the panacea for our ills. It is a shame that the churches have been so muzzled, so often self-blinded to the full dimensions of the gospel they profess, the gospel of Jesus himself.\"\n\nThrough this short book, Wright asks good questions and insightfully shows where The Gospel of Judas simply cannot be held as equal in any way to Scripture. He shows himself to be a New Testament scholar the equal of any involved in promoting this new gospel. While the document appears to be genuine, it is little different and little more significant than the multitudes of other gnostic writings which have come down to us, even two millenia later.\n\nIt is perhaps somewhat ironic that N.T. Wright, who has reimagined and reinvented many of the teachings of Paul (and thus Jesus), would be the first to make a stand for the truth against others who would seek to reinvent Jesus. Unfortunately, Wright\u0027s New Perspectives are glimpsed, even if only dimly, through much of the text of this book. Still, he offers a compelling response to Ehrman and others and one well worth reading. I would tend to believe that, for most people, The Gospel of Judas is best ignored. It offers little that would be of interest to the average person. For those who do have interest in it, Judas and the Gospel of Jesus will no doubt prove an interesting response to the irrational views espoused by those who wish to reinvent Christianity and to cast doubt upon Scripture\n",

When I travel on vacation I make sure to take his latest novel.   \"Piece of my Heart\" transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago.

    "\nSome previous reviewers have complained about  the complex style and writing of this book. Although in fact it is not an easily readable book, for the general public, if you have a serious interest about the history of the third Reich, make no mistake: you will not be able to overlook this book, which will surely be a  classic. It is a thoroughly well researched  contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism; the interaction between the \"new\" domestic and international values, based on aggression; and the other causes involved in the rise (and fall) of the III Reich. From a different perspective from other mainstream historians, this winner of the Samuel Johnson prize for non fiction,  has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat, one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular  period of history. No wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this  opus  -A new History- particularly well deserved.

    "\nAs a professional bridal consultant, I keep an extensive library of wedding related books on hand to help my brides design their own weddings.  Ms. McBride\u0027s Bridal Flowers is one of my favorites.

Ms. McBride shows that flowers are for more than just being carried or worn.  The large color photos are fantastic.  So many other books have little or no photos, or hand drawn diagrams that leaves the reader wondering.  Ms. McBride\u0027s book lets you see exactly what she is talking about.  It doesn\u0027t claim to be a how-to book, but perfect to take along when visiting your floral designer\n",
    "\nThis rare book details Aleister Crowley\u0027s ascension as the prophet of a new Aeon, the Aeon of Horus.

In fact, I questioned my new faith in Crowley\u0027s religion Thelema reading this book; this was for real and not a joke. After contemplating, I thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today\u0027s youth and Crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today.

    "\nTwain\u0027s account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \"Huckleberry Finn,\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.\n\nThe kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he\u0027s fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \"Puddn\u0027head Wilson, \"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\"\n\nAfter he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he\u0027d hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.\n\nThe material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \"the once renowned and vigorously hated\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he\u0027d had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)\n\nThe material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better\n",

As I boarded the plane with \u0026quot;The Carolina Way\u0026quot; under my arm, a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how I was enjoying the book.  I explained that I had not yet started the book, so I could not give an answer.  The gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as Dr. Gerald Bell, the co-author of \u0026quot;The Carolina Way\u0026quot;.  Myself a Carolina fan, I was pleased to meet Dr. Bell, as he spent several minutes talking about Coach Smith, whom I have admired for over forty years, and the UNC basketball program, which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under Coach Roy Williams. Dr. Bell\u0027s contributions to the book tie Coach Smith\u0027s leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from Carolina\u0027s storied history to today\u0027s business situations.  Surely, Coach Smith, given his ability to recruit top players, has been criticized by many for his failure to win NCAA championships in the manner of Coach John Wooden at UCLA, but winning two NCAA championships, winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict NCAA rules, and coaching top players that graduated at a +90% rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of Coach Smith\u0027s \u0026quot;system\u0026quot;.  Teamwork, integrity, loyalty, and hard work, are the cornerstones of the Carolina Way, and anyone in the position of managing, leading, or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book, corny as it is at times.

    "\nAlways think twice. Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision. That\u0027s the essence of Economics: \"looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy.\" \n\nMost economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson, as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book. Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.\n\nBeyond what you may think about the government\u0027s role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author\u0027s liberal views, \"Economics in One Lesson\" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.\n\nAs the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and \u0027rogue\u0027 economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do.

All of the recipes look tasty, though I would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes, especially some more creative ones.

    "\nJohn Gunther\u0027s INSIDE U.S.A. comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get, hurling us back to the America of 1947, as he explores, state by state, the people, politics, issues, passions and fads that make up our country.  Written with great energy and insight, Gunther captures an America justly proud of its WWII success, still unsure of its role in the world, and populated by fascinating characters like Mayor LaGuardia of New York, Governor Saltonstall of Massachusetts and Boss Hague of Jersey City.  Gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today.  He captures aspects of America that are gone,l never to return (an \u0026quot;industrial\u0026quot; nation based on coal, iron ore and steel.)  And he foresees issues that dog America to this day -- the \u0026quot;Negro problem\u0026quot; (actually, the \u0026quot;White problem.\u0026quot;)  He condemns the segregationist society he finds in America, so inconsistent with its lofty ideals.  As you can tell, I loved this book.  It\u0027s very hefty -- but every time you are about to put it down, Gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading.  All this said, Gunther does concentrate on the (a) historical, (b) political and (c) economic side of things.  You won\u0027t find much here about the arts or science.

    "\nI\u0027m not sure why Sony, which now owns I Dream of Jeannie, decided to colorize the first season of this series.  Whatever the reason, you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on Amazon.com that the original black-and-white version of the first season is worth a lot more.  The reason for that is simple--I Dream of Jeannie was originally broadcast in black-and-white.  And for a television fan like myself, that\u0027s the ONLY way to watch the first season.\n\nThe episodes themselves are just as I remember seeing them.  Since I wasn\u0027t around in 1965, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here.  But to me, they\u0027re still pretty good.  The theme music, in my opinion, is every bit as good as the second theme, introduced when Jeannie went to color in 1966.  \n\nThe one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that Sony stripped off the old Screen Gems animation from the end of every episode.  That logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s, and it is consistenly rated, along with Viacom\u0027s old blue V of Doom, as the scariest logo in the history of television.

    "\n9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling.  It takes a look at the workplace from a woman\u0027s view.\n\nWe first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is \"banging the boss\".\n\nBut the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he\u0027s been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.\n\nEach comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.  \n\nThe next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart\u0027s coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.\n\nThe next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart\u0027s absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else\u0027s glory.\n\nThe subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.

After working for an underground Hip-Hop magazine, I\u0027d already familiarized myself with a lot of information that I was too young to understand (being born in \u002781).  I visited the University of Hip-Hop in Chicago, interviewed underground artists, and went to breaking shows in the Illinois area.  Although I thought I was very familiar with Hip-Hop, after working with this magazine, I realized I knew NOTHING.\n\nSo when I was given the chance to do my research paper, I knew that I would be able to learn even more than I already knew from working for the magazine.  I watched the three parts of \"Beef\" first and saw an ad for this movie in the Extras section.  Honestly, the first thing that caught my eye was how gorgeous Mr. Wiggles was...but then after fully watching the preview, I realized this was the PERFECT movie for me to find out more about breaking.  \n\nThis movie documented the founding members, discussed the four elements of Hip-Hop, gave a lot of background information on Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash, talked about the different techniques in breaking, the label \"breakdancing,\" the media\u0027s dilution of breaking, the first movies that breaking was showcased in, new breaking groups...just a bunch of \"firsts.\"  It was a great reference for my paper, I enjoyed watching it, and I could watch it over and over again.  I have a lot of respect for the founders because without them, headz wouldn\u0027t have this beautiful culture to express ourselves physically, mentally, and verbally\n",
    "\nHonestly, I wasn\u0027t certain about this film, in fact, at first I actually believed it was related to \"Chocolate.\"   I was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised.  Upon first viewing, I did not laugh as much as the second time.  Yes, I tend to watch a film twice for I know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories.  I can be more relaxed and open minded the second time.  Second viewing was a belly full of laughter.\n\nThis is the best lesbian comedy I have ever seen.  The acting was wonderful and the film was fast paced.  Now that I decided that this film is exceptional, it was time to put it to the test on others (mostly women 20\u0027s - 80\u0027s years, some men.)  Each person I shared this film with, either loaning it or viewing it together, all responded similarly: \"This is a hysterically funny film.\"  \n\nWhat is even more amazing is the brief allotted time the director accomplished in completing the filming process - about twenty-two days. Congratulations, sometimes a tight budget can produce a true work of art.  Many short films I have seen on the \"Spiritual Cinema Circle\" also have numerous low budget wonderful productions.  Hoorah for the film art genius.\n\nI applaud the entire talented cast and crew, especially actress, Christine Cox, her performance was exceptionally wonderful.  I would like to see her in more comedies...she\u0027s a natural.  I fell \"in love with her\" and I am straight gal, as are all of the actresses except for Frances.\n\nA must see funny film.  I always wondered why the comedy male gay films always had that edge of humor when the lesbian films appeared more serious.  We need more films that are as pleasurable and diversified as \"Better Than Chocolate\".  Thanks bunches.\n",
    "\nIf you like action, shooting, explosions, fire, pain, torture and revenge, this is a movie you\u0027ll love.

    "\nFrankly, the idea of a Secret Service Agent having an affair with the President\u0027s wife is way out there in the first place. (Michael Douglas not withstanding).  If you like Keefer Sutherland (as in TV\u0027s 24) you will probably like this movie (his name could have been Jack Bower in  this flick too.  I thought it had good action, writing, acting and directing.  I would not mind seeing Keefer and Michael teamed up again on the same side.  I bought the dvd, but then again I collect movies for the actors.\n",
    "\ni saw this show on PBS and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it.  the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on.  i don\u0027t know of any other way to be able to see Yul Brynner\u0027s commanding King and I performance.  Loved it\n",
    "\nI had been aware that once there was a show called \"Mr. Show\", starring Bob and David, and that it had been on HBO. But I had never been compelled to buy any of their DVDs until this weekend, when the power of Satan...um, compelled me to pick up the first two seasons. All I gotta say is: Praise Satan for leading me to this glory!\n\nThe first season, comprised of four episodes, is fantastic, with flashes of brilliance on \"The Gay Porno Video\", but it\u0027s the second season that really will make you a fan. Such oddities as F.F. Woodycooks, Only The British Can Fly, Child-Labor Comedy Writers, the Iguana, and Jeepers Creepers: Semi-Star unleash the funny like you\u0027d never believe.\n\nMr. Show proves that there is a market for intelligent, hilarious sketch comedy...on cable, or in the case of KITH and Monty Python, imported from other countries. But Mr. Show is homegrown, it\u0027s comedy at a breakneck speed, and there\u0027s never a dull moment in either season. You\u0027ll laugh, you\u0027ll cry, you\u0027ll learn how to fight crime with a \"crime stick\" and ice cream, and enjoy tofu-based products while your business goes to hell...led by a red balloon. \n\n\"The security guard and I shared something in common...Me!\n",
    "\nThis comedy volume is absolutely great.  While I\u0027m a fan of the series, I thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next.  Definately don\u0027t watch Season 3 before seeing these seasons, because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree.  It doesn\u0027t move as fast as some comedy out there, but it all fits together better than most of what is on TV today\n",
    "\nI have loved this movie ever since I saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on (it\u0027s been some time now) and I plan to buy it.  Waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father.  I didn\u0027t realize when I first saw it that Reese Witherspoon was the daughter (that was before Reese Witherspoon became Reese Witherspoon).  A heartbreaking, beautifully acted and must-see film.  Rings true to life.  They certainly don\u0027t make movies like this anymore, and it\u0027s a shame\n",
    "\nSome classic episodes indeed.  All In The Family broke new ground in television sitcoms.  The world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households.  Archie Bunker\u0027s old fashioned values were being challenged.  It is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced Archie Bunker\u0027s views were.  Organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood?  Not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion? Quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone.\n\nCertainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970\u0027s.  Carol O\u0027Connor, Jean Stapelton, Sally Struthers, and Rob Reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times.  All In The Family spawned off may other great shows such as The Jeffersons, Maude, and indirectly Good Times.  This first season was certainly a reverred one.  Just look at it with an open mind\n",
    "\nGreat movie, great actors for such a sad part of the U.S. history ! It is great to see in this movie some men who really existed (especially \"Stonewall\" Jackson). We don\u0027t know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction, but at the end of the day it\u0027s not very important, because the historical interest is preserved \n",

    "\nI grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....  \n\nThe cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful.\n\nOK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70\u0027s flick \"The Deep\" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let\u0027s face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.  \n\nOverall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.   \n\n",

    "\nI liked this work out. It is very easy to follow. The instructor, who is very likable, gives good instructions.  She gives each dance move a \"fun\" name, so it is easy to remember. I do this work-out when I want to work-out, but do not have as much energy as usual or I will do it as a warm-up to another work-out. It always puts me in a good mood. I liked that it contains a good warm up and an isolation section. If you are looking for a hard-core dance fitness work-out that leaves you grasping for air as you are drenched in sweat, this is not for you. If you are looking for a fun, easy work-out, then this is for you\n",
    "\nMy 2 year old loves watching the DVD as well as listening to the CD in the car.  I have to admit that I have memorized all of the songs on the CD and the dances on the DVD too...they are very catchy and I find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around!  The lyrics are really cute and the beats are great.  Simple music but very creative.  I signed up for updates on Laurie Berkner\u0027s website so I can find out when/if she ever comes to town so my daughter (and I, of course) can go see her.  She is a great alternative to Barney and all of the other commercial characters, who I don\u0027t care much for.  I have bought this DVD/CD combo for all of my friends who have kids\n",

    "\nI loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3.  WHERE IS IT?  I hope that it is released soon.  It seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending!  A little unfair to the consumer don\u0027t you think!  It is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is.  Is that correct\n",
    "\nOhhhh! I caught this movie on regular TV and even with commercials it was good.  I bought it so I would get the whole movie.  I have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family.  A really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you!\n",
    "\nThis is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves.  The storyline is great, but this should have been the last DVD.  Things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over $20.  That\u0027s bogus.  DVDs can fit way more episodes on a single disc, and it\u0027s a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately.  The Cowboy Bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start, then dropped down to 4.  Now it\u0027s just getting worse.  At this point I\u0027m starting to regret buying the Stand Alone Complex series instead of renting it.  I am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out, though.  Throughout the series I think disc 4 was my favorite\n",

    "\nJULIE JOHNSON is a quiet little film that deals with the frustrations facing a New Jersey housewife and mother who married and birthed before she graduated high school and finds herself in a rigid relationship, longing for knowledge to change things.  She considers herself stupid, sneaks Science magazines to read when her overbearing husband isn\u0027t around, and finally gathers the courage (while staring at the stars one night) to change her plight.  She takes a computer course, passes her GED and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life.  Along the way she discovers other secrets about herself, buried in the facade of a life she has led.  She changes, relates to the world in a different way, and refuses to settle for returning to \u0027the old life\u0027 when her husband returns promising her change.  Her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels, but in the end this friendship cannot last, as her girlfriend doesn\u0027t have the same goals.\n\nThe story is simple, but in the hands of the writers Wendy Hammond and Bob Gosse and with Gosse\u0027s fine direction, the entire cast gives us an ensemble of disparate characters in whom we can all believe.  Lili Taylor plays the lead with extraordinary skill and as her girlfriend Courtney Love gives a bravura performance.  The remainder of the cast (Spalding Gray, Noah Emmerich, Gideon Jacobs, Mischa Barton, et al) is likewise strong.  But it is Taylor\u0027s film and she offers one of her most poignant performances of her career.  A thoughtful, sensitive, engrossing film.  Grady Harp, September 0\n",

His amazing voice, is just as amazing live, and he and his band, can JAM!! The energy is high, and its a great time!\nI had the priviledge of meeting him, and blubbered like an idiot, but he is just as cool a guy as he seems. He really appreciates his fan base, and understands how important it is for us to see him live. Im glad that finally, I can share with my friends who have never see Edwin live, what an amazing artist he really is!!!!\n",
    "\nThe much-celebrated fourth season of NBC\u0027s long-running medical drama, ER, is the recipient of two 1997-1998 Emmy awards, three 1997-1998 Screen Actors Guild awards, and one 1997-1998 Golden Globe award. \n\nFans of the show will be treated to roughly 16 hours chock full of trauma intertwined with personal and professional relationship trials between the doctors, nurses, support staff, and patients. The unrated six-disc set includes 22 episodes, Spanish and French language subtitles, and numerous special features including outpatient outtakes, a \"Cutups\" gag reel, \"Anatomy of an Ambush\", and the \"Ambush live post-show\". Outpatient outtakes allow viewers to watch deleted scenes straight from the cutting room floor, while the \"Ambush\" special features include analysis and discussion of the live episode as well as the subsequent celebration among the cast and crew.\n\nThe fourth season is ripe with talented and beautiful actors - some of the most adored cast members in ER history. The primary cast includes returning favorites George Clooney (Dr. Doug Ross), Anthony Edwards (Dr. Mark Greene), Noah Wyle (Dr. John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Nurse Carol Hathaway), Gloria Reuben (P.A. Jeanie Boulet), Eriq LaSalle (Dr. Peter Benton), Laura Innes (Dr. Kerry Weaver), and Maria Bello (Dr. Anna Del Amico). Also returning are Paul McCrane (Dr. Romano), William H. Macy (Dr. Morgenstern), and John Aylward (Dr. Anspaugh). \n\nNew stars to the ER this season include Alex Kingston (Dr. Corday), Mariska Hargitay (Cynthia Hooper), and Yvette Freeman (Nurse Adams). Recurring and special guest stars include Lisa Nicole Carson, Telma Hopkins, Dan Hedaya, CCH Pounder, Chad Lowe, Jorja Fox, Alan Alda, Harold Perrineau Jr.\n\nThis season also plays host to intense storylines, and, of course, emergencies. The DVD set begins with the legendary \"Ambush\" episode-ER\u0027s live season opener. Additional ighlights of the season include:\nDr. Greene dealing with the aftereffects of his mugging, his estranged family, and his wavering feelings for Hooper;\nDr. Ross losing his father, and potentially his fianc and career;\nPhysician Assistant Boulet dealing with HIV and the stigma associated with it;\nBenton\u0027s relationships with his newborn son, his girlfriend Carla, and his budding relationship with Dr. Corday;\nThe negative impact Synergix (an ER management firm) has on the lives of the staff;\nCarter trying to cope with his drug addicted cousin and personal issues with the remainder of his family;\nAnd much more!\n\nThe fourth season ER DVD is a must have for die hard ER fans, as well as for anyone who just loves a well-written, well-established drama.\n",
    "\nA very successful comedy. Highly recommendable. Players are magnificent.\nEspecially the final scene involving Kevin Cline\u0027s dancing act is unforgettable. Enables people to overcome deeply rooted prejudices about\nsexual practice.Sociological context significant.Leaves fine trails in spectators\u0027 brains\n",
    "\nI quite enjoyed watching this film, which is why I give it four stars, even though I think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic. So, why did I like it? Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Kevin Kline (in that order) and also a passably funny script -- at least one that is well structured for a feel-good viewing experience.\n\nJoan Cusack is wonderful here. Her blow-up at her wayward fiance after he stands her up  is fantastic, and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street, screaming \"Is this the Twilight Zone?\" at which point she collapses on the hood of Matt Dillon\u0027s car (in her wedding dress no less) -- well, that scene is adorable, especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of Shakespeare\u0027s Romeo and Juliet -- a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity. Yes, here is the heart of the film (so I cannot comprehend another viewer\u0027s criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film; she\u0027s obviously going to marry the movie star, and get to eat cheetos into the bargain). Matt Dillon is, as ever, the essence of cuteness, and a much more desirable husband than Kevin -- um, I mean Howard.\n\nKevin Kline does a decent job of mimicking Howard, a repressed gay man. But it still feels like mimicking, rather than acting. Here is also where the problems begin. I guess wearing a bow-tie means you are gay. And, similarly, the Barbra Streisand gag is beaten to death (and beyond). How many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like Barbra??!! Come on! Also, Kline\u0027s attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture . . . Not only is it not enough; it\u0027s really kind of humiliating.\n\nNonetheless, the final scene does give \"Mr. Holland\u0027s Opus\" a run for its money, and I can\u0027t deny it: I did really have fun watching this movie. It\u0027s basically a sound little production, well structured, reasonably well written, and Kevin Kline can dance\n",
    "\nI\u0027m not big on anime, but watching one episode got me hooked.  The voices, the animation, the story, the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch Samurai Champloo.\n\nEach and every episode just engrosses you deeper and deeper into the story line leaving you wanting for more. \n",
    "\nIf you are bored with Kurosawa\u0027s faithful decpition of historical Samurai (and who would be?), if you think the Samurai genre has been overused and outdated...then get ready for the hip-hop remix version of the age old genre: SAMURAI CHAMPLOO.  Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the man who brought us Cowboy Bebop and 2 shorts in Animatrix, with character design by Kazuto Nakazawa, Kill Bill vol. 1 fame, we are treated to a world that would have made the Wu-Tang Clan feel right at home.  The action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other. One follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play.  The music is all modern hip-hop, no moody asian flare here.\n\nThe story is about the adventures of these two warriors as they escort a pessant girl across Japan in search of a samurai who\u0027s only distinquishing characteristic is that \"he smells like sunflowers.\"  Lack of money, food, and patience is a recipe for disaster and wacky hi-jinks in this adventure-comedy.  Rated 16+ (the equivilent of R in the US) for bloody violence and language.  A must for any samurai genre fan\n",

    "\n\"The Good Earth\" must be considered a \"milestone movie.\" As yet, there is no DVD  but one packed with out-takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome. There was no Oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939; otherwise, \"The Good Earth\" would have \u0027taken home\u0027 that award! \n\nThe lovely Luise Ranier did  win \"Best Actress\" award. The 1937 movie was based on Pearl Buck\u0027s novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. Interest in \"The Good Earth\" was revived in Fall 2004 when it was selected for \"Oprah\u0027s Book Club\".   Perhaps women\u0027s rights advocates should also give it a boost?\n\nThe story is about China in the 1900s.  A simple farmer, Wang Lung, is \u0027given\u0027 (by his father) the slave O-Lan, for his bride.  I do not remember much from childhood about this film, but I definitely do not recall Paul Muni having such a mouthful of teeth! (special effecrs?!) Luise Ranier  had won an Oscar the previous year for her role in the \"Ziegfield Follies\" -- what a contrast!  Here she is the completely docile, loyal wife; as someone wrote, she was bound to her husband in \"eternal servitude.\"  And her devotion was betrayed.  Partly through the machinations of \"Uncle\".  At every time of crisis in the story along comes (GROAN!) the crafty, manipulatve uncle (Walter Connolly) who whines \u0026 wheedles - - inserting humor (?) into the script and at the same time destroying family amity. \n\nFrom the Internet Movie Database are the prophetic words of former slave O-Lan:  \"When I go back in that house, it will be with my son in my arms. I\u0027ll have a red coat on him... and red flower trousers... and a hat with a gilded Buddha and tiger-faced shoes, and I\u0027ll go into the kitchen where I spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe, and I\u0027ll show myself and my son to all of them.\"  (Smiles, contented)\nWang Lung:  \"Well... Now, I... I haven\u0027t heard you speak so many words since you came to this house.\" \n\nIsn\u0027t the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago? I found the quality of framed camera shots surprising \u0026 the production of many scenes quite amazing.  READ  Susan Wong\u0027s  wonderfully perceptive review on amazon.com.\n\nToday\u0027s movie-goers don\u0027t seem to care about \"true life\" documentation in films,  but animation couldn\u0027t convince as the 1930s true-life locusts do! That tired word \"awesome\" truly fits this vintage film:  the choking drought \u0026 famine, the beautiful  \u0027condensed\u0027 story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm,  and the terrifying  scenes of revolutionary uprisings.\n\nREVIEWER mcHAIKU  HAILS THIS FILM, and others that made an impact on my childhood!\n",

Petersen, Amy Brenneman and Alyssa Milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl (Witherspoon) and her seemingly perfect boyfriend (Wahlberg). Of course, the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker. Wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance. William Petersen (CSI) is outstanding as the Witherspoon\u0027s concerned father who has way too many issues himself. This film is a hidden gem. Buy it . . . you will not be disappointed\n",
    "\nOtto Preminger\u0027s EXODUS is a very well made film. This is a big film and director Preminger is a master at handling films of this scale. He is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature. Well, that is Preminger\u0027s style, straighforward and technically proficient movie making.\n",
    "\nI got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic -- the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college.  Good grief.  Since when is a musical ever realistic??  Especially one that is geared to kids.  Hello??!! It\u0027s not supposed to be realistic!  If you expect realism, go elsewhere.  But if you want to have some fun with a great message not-so-subtly woven in, then watch this movie.  Kids love it (mine do along with anyone else I\u0027ve talked to), and the message is just terrific ~ it\u0027s okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc., no matter what anyone else thinks.  I love it!  I can\u0027t even begin to say how much better this is than \"Grease,\" the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be \"happy.\"  Relax with your kids, go get some popcorn, and have some fun with the Wildcats kids from \"Highschool Musical.\n",
    "\nMy children (ages 6 and 11) absolutely love HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. My son\u0027s drama club is preparing to perform it this spring, and he\u0027s very excited about trying out for a part.

    "\nThere is not enough footage on the feud with Macho Man Randy Savage. I prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story. What did the Macho Man think about it? Unfortunately we can never get to hear from Ms Elizabeth. Would these be included in a future Macho Man DVD set? I was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy, especially in front of a huge live audience including kids. I was totally shocked when I first saw that on TV back in the 80\u0027s. Yes, that\u0027s hardcore. Deadly scary hardcore! That should not happen in the first place. The story involving Steamboat is well covered. It is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be. It is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing. There should be a line which should not be crossed. How can a real heavyweight guitar be used by Honky Tonk to hit Jake over the head? Human error? Hm... Nowadays Tripe H is using a hammer to hit others on the head. I guess a guitar is not a big deal by today\u0027s standard. Enough is enough. We don\u0027t need accidents!

I had never really seen Topher Grace outside of \u0027That 70\u0027s Show\u0027 which I never kept up with on a regular basis.  I fell in love the movie first time I saw it and bought it soon after it came out on DVD.  \n\nMr. Grace plays a 26 year-old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend.  He\u0027s become such a machine in a competivie world that he\u0027s loses his way in life.  I was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too.\n\nOne of mentor\u0027s has told me repeatedly that the mid-twenties can be one of the roughest times in life.  So many things are going at once on so many levels.  To me, this movie captured that.  Paul Weitz did a great job writing this.  The cast was exquisite\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve been waiting for this to come out on DVD since I first saw it back in July. I still can\u0027t understand why the critics just didn\u0027t get this one. This has to be one of the best second films ever made in a Trilogy. The addition of Davy Jones was brilliant. It made the film much darker and more dramatic. Johnny Deep was superb as usual. I still can\u0027t believe that the film made $400 million dollars domestically and over $1 billion dollars worldwide. It\u0027s surreal. But everything about this movie was so on point that it\u0027s not too surprising that it exceeded the first film. I enjoyed this one more than the original. I thought the story was more interesting on this occasion. Although, you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of Geoffrey Rush\u0027s character. He and Depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him. It was a huge void to fill. But enter Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and all is well. I guess that\u0027s one reason why \"Dead Man\u0027s Chest\" woks the way it does. Billy Nighy gives an A-list performance. And when you add in Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, it\u0027s money in the bank. The only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original \"Star Wars.\" Yes, I prefer \"Pirates\" over TLOTR. Although, perhaps my comments are premature since \"At World End\" hasn\u0027t even been released yet. Should that be a dud, then of course the whole thing falls apart. But here\u0027s hoping that the third time is a charmer. If you own the first \"Pirates\" on DVD then you have to get this. Don\u0027t miss out.\n",
    "\nI\u0027d give 4 stars for this DVD release.  The movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies.  To relate the atmosphere of an old 60\u0027s soviet \"eastern\" is not easy to an american viewer, and I believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice.  Besides that, it\u0027s a must have, particularly for any russian ex-pat\n",

    "\nI was amased at how very well acted, directed and written this movie was. The dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips. Everyone was well cast. It is great movie for anyone and transcends the lesbo-film cliche. It transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it\u0027s a \"gay\" movie. If you hated \"Go Fish\" like I did, you\u0027ll love this movie and go \"whew\" for this film - it saves our lesbian cinema souls! Buy it! you won\u0027t be sorr\n",
    "\nLeave it to the Coen Brothers to make Werner Heisenberg\u0027s Uncertainty Principle the crux of a film noir, and darned if they don\u0027t make a good case for it in \"The Man Who Wasn\u0027t There.\" (Typically, they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who can\u0027t even remember Heisenberg\u0027s name.) Chain-smoking nebbish barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) makes the only decisive (and dishonest) action of his life, and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several, mostly not-so-innocent, bystanders. In \"The Man Who Wasn\u0027t There,\" the phrase \"decisive action\" is an oxymoron; everything Crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance. Everything that happens--from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face--changes everything forever, and always for the worse. Set in 1949 in Santa Rosa, Calif. (a tip of the hat to Hitchcock and \"Shadow of a Doubt,\" perhaps?) \"The Man Who Wasn\u0027t There\" looks perfect. Like every other Coen film, it\u0027s a marvel of production design, and the genius photographer Roger Deakins nails to a tree the dusty black-and-white look of such classic noirs as \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Out of the Past.\" Thematically, however, \"The Man Who Wasn\u0027t There\" resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant, much better acted remake of Edgar G. Ulmer\u0027s \"Detour,\" in which the characters drift in a low-rent Sartrean hell, totally the victims of fate. But whereas \"Detour\" is more than the sum of its parts, \"The Man Who Wasn\u0027t There\" is less. The Coen Brothers may believe in chance, but on the screen they leave nothing to chance, so that everything in \"The Man Who Wasn\u0027t There\" is TOO perfect. In the end the film has the same overstudied, clinical quality that afflicts every Coen film except \"Fargo.\" (It must be admitted, though, that only one Coen film--\"The Hudsucker Proxy\"--is ruined by that quality.) The acting is as superb as in any Coen film. Thornton--in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together--burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense, hangdog gravity. There are also glittering supporting performances by Frances McDormand as Thornton\u0027s philandering wife Doris; James Gandolfini as her paramour and boss; Jon Polito as a shady businessman; Michael Badalucco as Thornton\u0027s motormouth brother-in-law; Scarlett Johansson as the teenager Thornton chastely fancies; and especially Tony Shalhoub, nearly stealing the picture as Freddy Riedenschneider, defense attorney extraordinaire.\n",
    "\nI was not privy to the world of Christopher Guest until a friend of mine told me that if I liked `Drop Dead Gorgeous\u0027 then I would flip over any of Guest\u0027s films.  The video store only had one in, and that was `Best in Show\u0027 and I\u0027m SOOOOO glad they had it.  This film has to be one of the funniest films I\u0027ve ever seen, a complete riot from beginning to end.  As a true `mockumentary\u0027 every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document\u0027 the Mayflower Dog Show.  The film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy.  There\u0027s Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Crenshaw play Leslie and Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (total spoof on the whole Anna Nicole Smith scandal), owners of a prize winning poodle who\u0027s won `Best in Show\u0027 2 years straight, and with the help of lesbian handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) hopefully she\u0027ll win for a third.  Then there\u0027s Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest himself), a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist.  And there\u0027s power comic couple Eugene Levy and Catherine O\u0027Hara who play the Flecks, owners of a terrier, who struggle with Mrs. Flecks long line of previous lovers.  There are lovers Stefan \u0026 Scott (Michael McKean \u0026 John Michael Higgins) who spoil their Shih Tzu\u0027s and each other.  But finally we have the star couple of the show, the neurotic Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey \u0026 Michael Hitchcock), owners of Beatrice, and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative\u0027 Weimaraner who\u0027s been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex.  Their antics, arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film, and their chemistry is pure brilliance.  The film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken WAY TO SERIOUS, and with Fred Willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish\n",
    "\nA great behind-the-scenes look at decisions that shaped history - and nearly killed all of us.\nCross-reference this with the more recent Kennedy biographies for a wider, sobering context.\nThis is the sort of thing that the Bush Administration should have watched before deciding to invade Iraq. \n",

    "\nFerris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He\u0027s the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn\u0027t have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another \"sick\" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).\nIt\u0027s funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It\u0027s amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he\u0027s having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris\u0027 girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the \u002761 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that\u0027s as old as time. It\u0027s about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: \"Life moves pretty fast; if you don\u0027t stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it.\" That\u0027s the moral of the story, really. \n\"Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?\" Not here, but he\u0027ll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day\n",
    "\nHighly enjoyable tale of the life of Marty Maher, the Irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become West Point\u0027s beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years. Despite personal tragedies, and through two World Wars, Maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished Army officers\u0027 academy, including future legends like Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Tyrone Power is excellent and compelling as he portrays Maher from young idealist to elderly sage, Irish accent intact all the way. The scenery and West Point pageantry is fun to watch (although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio -- but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the Military Academy). Interestingly, there\u0027s not really all that much football in this film -- there\u0027s a little, but it\u0027s mainly the story of Maher and his family, and the young men he came to love like his own sons. With the flame-haired Maureen O\u0027Hara as Maher\u0027s Irish wife Mary, giving a  radiant performance. Sentimental in that \u002750s way, of course, but the legendary director John Ford (working with a cast made up of many of his favorites) always puts a bite behind the sweetness\n",
    "\nWhen I read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts.  I thought, \"Yeah, right.\"  But you really can pick and chose and combine what you want.  You can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio.  It is up to you.  Or you can choose from the basic low, medium, or high intesity workouts.  This is a great workout DVD and Denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part.  I\u0027d recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home\n",
    "\nPBS did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together.  It covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films.  The documentary includes many interview pieces with Kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like.  Also, there are comments from noted Japanese film historian Donald Richie.  As a Kurosawa fan watching this on PBS when it aired, the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour.  It is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century\n",
    "\nThis is a work of genius. It is creative, original, funny and well done. That being said, it is probably not for everyone. \n\nThis wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from Shakespeare\u0027s HAMLET. These are the stars of the show. In Hamlet, they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with Hamlet\u0027s melancholia. They appear briefly and are gone. The last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. They are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince.\n\nIn this work, the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them. The spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them. As they discuss existential questions, the tragedy of Hamlet plays out around them. It is quite funny but some background helps.\n\nIt helps a great deal if you are comfortable with Elizabethan speech. Whole pieces are lifted from Shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style.\n\nIt helps if you are familiar with Hamlet. That makes understanding the context easier.\n\nIt is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics. Rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn.\n\nIt\u0027s is fun.\n",
    "\nNothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent.  Every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even William Shatner would envy, and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical.  As anybody who has seen this show knows, the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into double-entendre and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for British comedy.  (Although, as \"children\" of the Three Stooges, Americans are, I think, accustomed to somewhat heavier-handed comedy.)\n\nFor those who don\u0027t know this series, it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids (I wouldn\u0027t let mine watch with me until they are at least 20, by which time they will probably find this material boring).  If you are assembling a comedy collection, however, this series fills a unique niche.\n\nMy only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate.  It doesn\u0027t even come in a box, but rather in a little \"accordion-folder\" package which is neither aesthetic nor practical (can\u0027t stack) nor particularly protective.  It is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them (I chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble, but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape; works fine)\n",
    "\nI am a huge anime fan, and this is by far the best.  Lemme just say, God I can\u0027t even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is.  It inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy.  The whole series is actually based on a true story in Japan.  A few hundred years ago, the entire population of wolves in Japan became extinct.  There are people there, even today that report wolf sightings occasionally :)\n\nIf you\u0027re a fan of wolves, or looking for something a little different, CHECK THIS DVD OUT!\n\nThe musics great, the drawing is perfect -- not just a random bunch of stills like most animes, but actual movement!  You get 4 episodes per DVD, each is a little over 20 minutes long.  This DVD includes:\n\n19. A dream of an oasis -- this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep.  Kiba finds a place where he is truly happy, and wonders if he has finally found paradise.\n\n20. CONSCIOUSLY -- this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series.  It has gorgeous music, and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever, just brilliant.\n\n21. Battle\u0027s Red Glare -- Orcom\u0027s men are fighting against an enemy, and the wolves are caught in the middle.  We see a lot of Blue in this episode (she\u0027s so cute as a puppy :) and Cher.\n\n22. Pieces of a shooting star -- The group decides to cross a sea of ice, but it turns out not to be such a good idea :(  Toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff.\n\nI can\u0027t say enough about this series -- unless you\u0027ve seen the whole thing, you can\u0027t judge it.  It\u0027s made by the same people as \"Cowboy Beebop\" and this DVD is preparing us for the typical BONES conclusion ;)  The next DVD is way sad and very depressing; no matter how tough you are, you will be crying by the end\n",
    "\nOkay...when I heard about The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection I was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of The High School Reunion Collection which was released several years ago.  Both sets were released by Universal.  Fear not, I am here to tell you about the differences.  The first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies.  Like it\u0027s closest cousin The High School Reunion Collection, The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection includes the exact same movies-\"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Sixteen Candles\" and Weird Science.\"  The cover art on the DVD\u0027s is the same, no new bonus material with each film that I detected.\n\nIt has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off.  No one even really pegged this acting group \"The Brat Pack,\" until around 1985.  Molly Ringwald was one of the best known Brat Pack members and \"Sixteen Candles\" helped to start the whole Brat pack phenom but no one ever considered \"Weird Science\" a Brat Pack movie. Trust me, I remember the 80\u0027s.  It always seemed like it would make more sense to include \"St Elmo\u0027s Fire\" or \"Pretty in Pink\" in with this set.  This is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included.\n\nThe music CD includes the following songs-\"True\" by Spandau Ballet, \"Tenderness\" by General Public, \"If You Leave\" by OMD, \"Weird Science,\" by Oingo Boingo, \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello (which was in \"Ferris Bueller\u0027s Day Off\", Pretty in Pink by the Psychedelic Furs, \"Don\u0027t You Forget About Me,\" by Simple Minds and \"I Go Crazy\" by Flesh For Lulu.\n\nWhy include music from \"Pretty In Pink\" and not include the movie?  On to the packaging.  The packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning.  I own over 100 TV on DVD and box  sets and nothing is like this.  The DVD\u0027s are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the DVD\u0027s are in sleeves instead of jewel cases. On the back page of the binder is a pop quiz.\n\nFor the most part it is very similar to The Highschool Reunion collection but it\u0027s nice to have the bonus CD and the cool packaging.  However, it would have been nice if Universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection. One must assume they must not own the rights to \"Pretty in Pink\" (it\u0027s listed as a Parmount DVD) because that is easily one of the best known Brat Pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term Brat Pack associated with it. \n",
    "\nOne of the many reasons we love movies is how they make us feel, how they make us react. \"Dave\", a wonderful Ivan Reitman political confection is one of those rare movies we watch over and over again to get that warm fuzzy we all need from time to time. Kevin Kline shines as the President\u0027s sweet natured slightly goofy stand in after the The Chief Executive suffers a major stroke while boffing an aide. The rest of the supporting cast also turn in exceptional performances as does the film score music which frames the film beautifully. The relationships between Dave and the First Lady as well as Dave and the head Secret Service man at the White House are especially touching. I absolutely love this movie. You will too.\n",
    "\nThe question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act, but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders. The answer, presented by material in the film, is an unflinching no. There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three.\n\nThe film\u0027s strengths are that it doesn\u0027t preach, at least not in an overly wrought narrative, and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims. I can understand the pain and confusion of the victim\u0027s families. What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them. The victims\u0027 families are the most terrifying aspect of this film. At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone \"I hate them... I hate them and the mother\u0027s that bore them.\"\n\nIs there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child? No, quite natural really. But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started. I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in... I\u0027ll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time.\n\nOn the issue of the prosecution. They had next to nothing. A very questionable confession from a terrified kid, Jessie, with a 72 IQ, hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof, a knife found behind Damien\u0027s house which doesn\u0027t match the wounds on the bodies, and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca, he must be a Satanist.\n\nTo look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film. Jessie, a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world. His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder. Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no\u0027s. The second reason, and the most important, is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn\u0027t seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera, smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them.\n\nAll of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other, more sinister and shocking, suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it, and terrifying to think they didn\u0027t\n",
    "\nIf you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for \"A Beautiful Mind\" or even \"Lord of the Rings\" you\u0027ve missed the boat. This movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what\u0027s so great about it. See this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh, to gross you out, to surprise you with its clever twists of plot, to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds, and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates\u0027 treasures.\n",
    "\n All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn\u0027t like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won\u0027t cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid (\u0026 underrated) \u002780s film. The WORST \u002780s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don\u0027t say I didn\u0027t warn you!\n",

    "\nI\u0027ll admit that I\u0027m a Johnny-come-lately to the \"Madea\" series, finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece. Creator Tyler Perry and his alter-ego, the opinionated, pistol-packing, chain-smoking (never lit, by the way) \"Madea,\" have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans, mostly African-American, nationwide.\n\nThough the stories feature the tried-and-true clich�d characters (the belligerent teenager, the devoted wife, the straying husband, the vixens, the lotharios, etc.) and situations (infidelity, promiscuity, straying from the church, comedic funerals, obnoxious and overbearing family members), Perry\u0027s productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story\u0027s ending dependent upon DIVINE INTERVENTION making things right. Some of the acting performances are a little over the top, and the musical selections, though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists, are weak in the lyrics department; however, as a whole, the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational.\n\nPerry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by Hollywood, and is having great success on both the stage and screen.\n\nThis compilation lets the viewer experience and/or revisit those money-making stage shows.\n",
    "\nInliked the film in the theater and I like the film now.  The plot does not drag and does not bore\n",
    "\nI was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford\u0027s acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like \"The Hunt for Red October\" or \"Crimson Tide\" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew\u0027s attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice\n",
    "\nKids will be kids! Within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive, honorable and brave. These raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of \"love.\" Risk becomes only the next step. Susan Sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength, courage, wit and willingness to go up against the BIG, tough bad guys with all the money and power. Tommy Lee Jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power \"fools.\n",
    "\nThis is an excellent movie if you like war flicks. It made me angry being from the Vietnam generation also. It shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men. The acting from all the cast was top class. I highly recommend this movie. It may be slow at first, but the action later is amazing\n",
    "\nRichard Dryfuss and Holly Hunter are fabulous in this wonderful remake of \"A Guy Named Joe\". Full of great flying, laughs with John Goodman, and a special appearance of Audrey Hepburn in her last film. You\u0027ll love it\n",
    "\nAs you can tell from my other reviews, I own a lot of Kathy Smith DVD\u0027s. The reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great cue-ing and instruction. She always cues from YOUR point of view, when she says left it\u0027s YOUR left, which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen. \n\nThis step workout has 3 segments, designed for beginner, intermediate and advanced. The beginner should stop after segment 1 and go to the cooldown. The intermediate stepper should finish segments 1 and 2 and then proceed to the cooldown. The advanced stepper can do all 3 segments before cooling down. \n\nEach segment gives you two options: high impact (power moves) or low impact. Higher impact consists of modifying low impact moves to contain more jumps. One person in each segment does the low impact moves so you can follow her. \n\nSegment 1: 12 minutes long. Easy to follow basic stepping. Kathy and company use a springboard step but any step (or even no step for beginners) will work just fine. \nSegment 2: 13 minutes long. Slightly more intense than segment 1 and more add on sequences. After you\u0027ve been stepping 6 minutes Kathy moves to squats and lunges which gives you a rest and lets your heartrate lower. This is my only complaint about this video, I wish she would have added this at the end of the entire video and continued cardio through the entire 2nd segement. However, this segment only lasts ~4 minutes so it\u0027s not that big of a deal. There is a heart rate check after this segment. \nSegment 3: 12 minutes. The step is switched to the other position for a bit more variety. A few squats and leg lifts in sequence finish out this segment. \n\nThere is a 5 minute cooldown and a little bit of a stretch (probably won\u0027t be adequate for most people after this workout). \nShe has a safety demonstration after the cooldown where she promotes the step she shows in the video, but should be viewed by first time steppers to make sure they do it properly. \n\n\n\n",
    "\nI\u0027m giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand - you receive one of the greatest MGM musicals ever conceived and it\u0027s bolstered by quite nice extras. That much you can be assured of.\n\nI\u0027m writing this particular review because of Warner Bros. insistance on using fragile, cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases. \n\nThe problem with these Warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case, rendering it\u0027s capability the actually hold the disc useless. And unlike the plastic cases, the Warner ones cannot be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer (good luck with that, by the way). \n\nAnother problem lies with the fact that it\u0027s made out of cardboard - when you remove the anti-theft stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover. This can occur even when you\u0027re carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off.\n\nThe reason I feel the need to mention this is I own dozens of Warner movies, and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one (not likely, Greedy Bros.)\n\nTo be fair, Warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases - the top-notch Film Noir and Gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases. But titles like \"Kiss Me Kate\", \"Rebel Without A Cause\", \"Broadway Melody of 1940\", and even \"Wizard of Oz\" are still only available in these sad cardboard cases. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "\nI just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone\u0027s MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.  \n\nRiveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, \"a tour through hell.\"  This film makes you think.   The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another.\n\nDuring the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn\u0027t depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films.\n\nAll of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN\u0027T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict.\n\nI felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn\u0027t close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time.\n\nThe film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see.\n\nOverall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific.\n\nAll in all this is an 5 star film\n",
    "\nA deeply emotional film about Addiction, Love, and Family just to some, but when you watch this film you take something with you , something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted, LIfe. Each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending, really depressing movie but worth a look at least once. Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly were extremely good but Ellen Burstyn broke my heart her performance Rocked\n",
    "\nI teared up when I heard the music from the theme song to the Electric Company for the first time in 30 years. I grew up with this show and now my children are learning from it too. Thanks to whoever arranged to have it released on DVD.  It was and still is a great show\n",
    "\nI agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say Baby Einstein videos, however, I still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay. My two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although I agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland.  I love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the DVD. My son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days. The video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development. Hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing.\n",

    "\nI really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work. I\u0027m a photographer but not this line of work. It was an interesting glimpse into their lives. I wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries, personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting. Some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it.\n",
    "\nOne of the most beautiful and sympathetic movies ever made about wolves, Alaska, and the Inuit, I could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it. A mid-level analyst who just happens to be in the right place at the right time (he has his doubts early on)is chosen to go North to investigate the Arctic wolf and its impact on the caribou population. Along the way he encounters a host of intriguing characters, including a crazy-like-a-fox entrepreneurial bush pilot looking to make some sort of big score, a number of wacky bit players who I can easily imagine were not actors, but the real deal, and every bit as eccentric as they appeared; and an endearingly sage old Inuit of few words but many eloquent silences.\n\nThe investigator, Tyler, is not at all sure that he\u0027s up to the demands of the job, but forges ahead regardless, played with practical flair by Charles Martin Smith, a perfect choice for the lead here. I would be at a loss and panic-stricken if left alone on a frozen lake in Alaska, as his character Tyler is; Tyler takes it all in stride, trusting it will all be good in the morning, even though it is established early that for all the fact that he was chosen for this mission, he goes into it with a deep-seated terror of wolves.\n\nAfter the assistance of the old Inuit man in getting centered on his path - and the abrupt disappearance of his benefactor, who has a way of coming and going that magicians would envy - Tyler finds himself deep in the bush country and immersed in the world of wolves before he realizes how completely they have taken him over. Knowledge and observance quickly negates his fear, and he is brought to a serenity of spirit and understanding of his place in the world that makes me wish I had the courage and stamina to go out and try it too.\n\nA caveat: there is a culinary moment in this movie that might cause the squeamish some distress. Do what I did at the crucial moment; look at the ceiling, or recite to yourself, \"It\u0027s only chocolate, it\u0027s only chocolate.\" You\u0027ll know when it gets close; they don\u0027t spring it on you; and it IS just chocolate.\n\nHighly recommended for the whole family.(Oh one more caveat; if skinny-dipping adults offend you - briefly skinny-dipping, and not flagrantly overt - then maybe this isn\u0027t your movie.)\n",
    "\n\nAbout a young scientist (played by Charles Martin Smith) who goes to the Arctic to study wolves, their survival, and their effect on the caribou herds (he proves they are not killing the caribou, as it had been assumed). He is a fledgling in the wilds, but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves. He notices the wolves eating mice, and begins to do the same himself - a supreme irony in this Disney film. The first half is excellent, compelling and beautiful to watch; but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a man-as-encroacher bad guy message and a confusing man-as-wolf Indian mysticism presentation. It\u0027s wonderfully photographed, though, and the soundtrack is stunning\n",
    "\nWho could ever forget the image of happy-go-lucky Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy) turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle, infectious Portuguese accent, \"Yo ho little fish don\u0027t cry don\u0027t cry\". If you\u0027re a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from Spencer Tracy\u0027s signature movie, `Captains Courageous\u0027 released in \u002737. \n\nPlot: Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew), an Ill-mannered rich kid falls overboard off a luxury vessel and finds himself adrift until a passing merchant fishing ship pulls him out of the sea. He is taken under the tutorage of his rescuer, a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Harvey is initially hostile to the thought of having to obey orders and work for his room and board until the ship returns to dock, but eventually comes to understand the important lessons in life being imparted by Manuel. Before his adventure at sea is over he\u0027ll learn what it means to be a man.\n\nThis is without a doubt my favorite Spencer Tracy film and a story the entire family will enjoy. It\u0027s beautifully filmed with a tremendous cast which includes along with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew the legendary Lionel Barrymore as Disko and John Carradine as Long Jack\n",
    "\nAfter Spinal Tap, this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown.  But like ST, it is right on.  These wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it\u0027s satire, it\u0027s real.  If you hate even the idea of folk music, skip it--or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people.  If you were there--I was--it\u0027s a real hoot(enanny)!  Sadly, here in California, they were to be found en masse at every local 99 Cents Only stores.  I realize this is not for everyone, but neither was Spinal Tap.  Give it a try\n",
    "\nWhen you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the `70\u0027s generation you\u0027re talking about Paddy Chayefsky\u0027s brilliantly written black comedy, `The Hospital\u0027 which was released in `70.\n\nA contemporary, dysfunctional, urban hospital serves as the microcosm of America\u0027s failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century, but the mental and emotional illnesses as well. George C. Scott stars in the role of Dr. Herbert Bock, hospital administrator. Dr. Bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity. His wife has left him, he\u0027s estranged from his children and he\u0027s in the grips of a mid-life crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question. When a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff Dr. Bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad.\n\nWith great performances by George C. Scott and the lovely Brit Diana Rigg, `The Hospital\u0027 is a thought-provoking film that will elicit discussion and debate. Watch it with a friend\n",
    "\nIt\u0027s a [more vulnerable] Patton in a white coat, running a hospital, and it\u0027s all great fun, with a good story from an Oscar-winning script.  You have to love it when Scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow. You half-expect him to finish her off with \"There are brave men DYING out there!\"\n",

    "\nMost likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone, but I wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is.  I am a long time U2 fan and had seen Rattle and Hum, but didn\u0027t get around to purchasing the DVD until late 2005.  The fact that the music is wonderful is a given, but the cinematography is just astounding.  I love how you get to see everything from every point of view.  You get to see what the band sees on and around the stage, including the breathtaking sea of fans.  You get to see what the fans see -- the spectacular lighting and silhouettes.  You get to hear what the guys think and feel off-stage as well as on.  And of course you get the passionate music.  The film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to.  I couldn\u0027t ask for more\n",

    "\nThe story of a young award winner of a filmmaker\u0027s competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get \"his\" first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by Christopher(Spinal Tap)Guest. It\u0027s a cynical and hysterical look at how Hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis.\n \nUnlike many of favorable reviewers I\u0027m not a fan of Christopher Guest\u0027s later works and that\u0027s not just because I\u0027m envious of him being married to Jamie Leigh Curtis(lucky dog). I don\u0027t find Guffman or Best of Show more than mildly amusing at best. Save for Bob Balaban in Guffman(When Sparky comes back, I almost bust a gut). \n\nSometimes artists do their best work up front. I like Woody Allen\u0027s first three pictures the best(What\u0027s Up Tiger Lily, Take the Money and Run, Bananas). I think this is the case here. Guest hit gold. Great script, terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast. A near genius(I\u0027m gonna steal one of the other reviewer\u0027s word here because it\u0027s so perfect, kudos and thanks) \"turn\" by JT Walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history(alas, another \"great\" dying so soon before his time like Warren Oates and Robert Shaw). Fabulous work by Martin Short, Teri Hatcher, J,T, Walsh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Fran Drescher, Dan Schneider, Jason Gould, Wakter Olkewicz and seriously I could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines. There are tons of people in this sublime comedy. \n\nIts only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the Eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene(Bacon/McKean)that comes off as way too cloying. Other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of Hollywood. \n\nSomeone said comparing this to The Player was like comparing Bagger Vance to Caddyshack. I\u0027m not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be sub-par. Caddyshack is a classic and so The Big Picture. I am a big, big fan of Altman and The Big Picture is even par with The Player. If either were more biting I would give the nod to The Big Picture. Though, Richard E Grant\u0027s performance is almost as good as Walsh\u0027s.\n\nNick\u0027s(Kevin Bacon)flights of fancy are hysterical. This is an inspired and unfortunately one-of-a-kind comedy.\n",
    "\nFirst of all, I have lost count of the ammount of times I have seen this movie but every time I watch it I get goose bumps. This is how affective the movie is.\n\nGeorge C. Scott (of \"Patton\" fame) plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy. Soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and Mr. Scott begins to investige the house\u0027s history. This is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film.\n\nThis movie is all about atmosphere. There are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays. This film does not need to gross the viewer out. The Changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters. You are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease. There is nothing \"in your face\" about the scares. \n\nThis film is for fans of the 1960\u0027s film \"The Haunting\" or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story. Don\u0027t even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and I guarantee you\u0027ll watch it more than once. I have recommended it to many people and I never heard a negative comment. For the full effect, wait until night to watch it and then watch it alone. See how many times you glance over your shoulder. \n",
    "\nOne of the productions of which he is the most proud, Robert Redford\u0027s ALL THE PRESIDENT\u0027S MEN should be required viewing (and the Woodward/Bernstein book should be required reading) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist.  Redford was fascinated with the story of two young, untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the Watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the United States.  Redford\u0027s involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary, so he followed as the story developed.  He got to know Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when they were still at ground level, still unsure as to where this would all lead, but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics.  \n\nRedford has always been a political animal, with a reporter\u0027s instinct, and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the American political climate.  Earlier, he and director Michael Ritchie had made THE CANDIDATE, a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well-meaning of men or women (and a film well worth your time).    It took two years of hard work to get ALL THE PRESIDENT\u0027S MEN off the ground.  It was turned down by several studios, with the excuse that people were tired of Watergate, but he was finally able to get Warner Bros. to say yes, provided Redford himself would star.  \n\nDustin Hoffman was enlisted to play Carl Bernstein, Redford\u0027s old friend Jason Robards won an Oscar as Washington Post Editor-In-Chief Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden was cast as Editor Harry Rosenfeld, Martin Balsam was Editor Howard Simons, Jane Alexander was Judy Hoback, bookkeeper to the Committee to Re-Elect the President (C.R.E.E.P.), Ned Beatty was Martin Dardis, who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence, Stephen Collins was Hugh Sloan, whose wife Debbie (played by Meredith Baxter) kept his conscience working on the right side, Robert Walden (who would go on the the fine television series LOU GRANT) was Dirty Trickster Donald Segretti, and Hal Holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story:  the mysterious Deep Throat, who helped Woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall.  Of course, we now know that Deep Throat was the FBI\u0027s Assistant Director W. Mark Felt, an old friend of Woodward\u0027s and a man torn between his loyalty to the FBI and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings-on.  \n\nRedford asked Alan J. Pakula to direct and Gordon Willis to handle the cinematography, and they crafted a look that is part documentary, part thriller. (If you get a chance, also see Pakula and Willis\u0027 THE PARALLAX VIEW, starring Warren Beatty.  Another outstanding, scary political film.)  William Goldman, who won an Oscar for BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, wrote the tight, exciting screenplay for which he won again (this was actually the fourth time Redford and Goldman had worked together; Goldman also adapted Donald E. Westlake\u0027s THE HOT ROCK, a very funny caper film, and the poignant THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER, which was out for a short time on DVD in Pan and Scan, but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful Widescreen splendor.  Universal, where are you?)\n\nThe efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes ALL THE PRESIDENT\u0027S MEN a smashing success.  It succeeds as an exciting, suspenseful procedural, as a statement on the neccessity of a free press, as a character study, and as a great movie-movie.  \n\nThe double-disc DVD set is the one to buy:  the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp, clean 1:85 aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by Redford himself.  The second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film, on Woodward and Bernstein, and on Deep Throat.  There is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film, and an interview with Jason Robards on the Dinah Shore show.\n\nA deserved landmark in film and in journalism, ALL THE PRESIDENT\u0027S MEN is a must-see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be, a must-own.  In our darkest hour, when all seems obfuscated and hopeless, it reminds us that light can be brought to bear.  People CAN make a difference\n",
    "\nPeter Palmer and Leslie Parrish are excellent in this fun, politically skewering musical comedy. The songs are upbeat fun, especially \"Put Em Back\" sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates\n",
    "\nLIL ABNER is a delightful comedy-musical with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals.  This film version of the Broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on DVD in a beautiful print with it\u0027s comic book coloring.  It\u0027s also superbly cast.  The film\u0027s producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play Lil Abner and Daisy Mae - Peter Palmer (who starred in the Broadway show) and Leslie Parrish - but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles (it\u0027s hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as Abner anyway, although Daisy Mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era). It\u0027s a shame neither Palmer or Parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years. Both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals, as the Dogpatch crowd might say.  \n\nIt\u0027s true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable - notably \"Jublian P. Cornpone\", \"A Typical Day in Dogpatch\", and \"Put \u0027em Back The Way They Was\" which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young Valerie Harper (\"Rhoda\") and Beth Howland (\"Alice\") but most of the songs are good-humored  and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original Broadway show.  Jerry Lewis has a funny walk-on cameo and the gorgeous Julie Newmar and Stella Stevens have amusing secondary roles. Most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here, including Donna Douglas as the busty hillbilly girl (a few years before becoming famous as one on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES) who wants \"to broaden our horizons\" and is informed by Mammy Yokum (superbly played by Billie Hayes) that she her horizons is broaden enough.  There\u0027s quite a bit of political satire in here as well (with politicans with such apt names as Mayor Dogmeat and Senator Jack S. Phigbound) and the Sadie Hawkins Day sequence (a Dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it\u0027s own with many high schools for years having an annual  \"Sadie Hawkins Dance\" in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered \"acceptable\") is a lot of fun.  But then so is the movie.  As a Yoakam says when they really mean it - \"I Has Spoken!\"\n",
    "\nI saw this movie before I read the books. The books are much funnier, and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film. Still, I liked the film and especially Baby Sunny. I thought Jim Carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions (as always) brought the character to life. I think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film, the essence of the story was captured, and is entertaining. But I do recommend reading the Series before or after watching the film\n",
    "\n\"Haunted Castle\" and \"Alien Adventure\" are great, but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of \"Encounter in the Third Dimension\" makes it better than the other two.  The film is an excellent way of showing how 3D started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in, other than the entire movie itself.  I do wish the mine ride was longer though (the one which ends with the big, round, stone ball slamming into the tunnel) and there was more shown of the T3 Experience.  Sure, the Jules Verne \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" ride certainly makes up for it, but the effects in the shorter example were awesome, like the bats.  Best of all, the film doesn\u0027t look all that dated CGI wise for a 1998 production.  Now I\u0027ve definitely got to get the sequel \"Misadventures in 3D\" DVD.  Noticed something stupid in the credits for \"Encounter\".  Instead of saying \"Cassandra Peterson as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark\", it redundantly reads, \"Elvira as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark\".  Unlike the other 3D IMAX films, this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2D wise.  Of course, the best is 3D since that is the whole point of the story anyway.  I highly recommend this movie to all 3D collectors\n",
    "\nThat this film is dedicated to the memory of David Maysles should tell you all you need to know about what\u0027s in store. Along with his brother Albert, David Maysles created some of the most groundbreaking and fascinating documentaries of the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s (\"Gimme Shelter,\" \"Salesman,\" \"Grey Gardens\"), and Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky did a fabulous job here of carrying on the stylistic tradition. The story of the poor and semi-literate Ward brothers is touching and engrossing, despite the squalor in which they lived, and this early 90\u0027s legal case is a significant study in cultural assumptions and regional justice. Absorbing, and worth owning.\n\nThis 10th anniversary edition packs on a host of extras, but just an FYI: The \"Product Detail\" here on Amazon that suggests that this \u0027stars\u0027 Connie Chung is wildly inaccurate; she did a piece on the Ward brothers which we see them watching on a TV for a couple of minutes, and that\u0027s all.

    "\nLady and the Trap has been an enduring Disney classic for 50 years now and it\u0027s amazing how well it holds up after all that time.  The hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch.  This film is an example of Disney animation at its classic best.  \n\nBut calling Lady and the Tramp a great animated film is really selling it short.  It\u0027s a great MOVIE, period.  Lady\u0027s idyllic life is shattered and bad boy Tramp comes to her rescue.  While he begins his relationship with Lady in the dog house (sorry, couldn\u0027t resist), he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end.  If you\u0027ve seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you\u0027ll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans.  Watch Lady and the Tramp and you\u0027ll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years.\n\n",
    "\nI have been a casual fan of the radio version of \"Prairie Home Companion\" for decades, although I seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time, usually only if I am driving somewhere on a Saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast. I read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it, and while most critics kind of liked it, there were a few grumbles. However, I thought the film was excellent, and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans. I liked all the casting, too. Robert Altman is not a favorite director, but when he is good, he is very good, as in \"M*A*S*H* and \"Nashville.\" When he is bad, he is terrible. But here, I thought he done good. Same with Garrison K. I trashed his recent novel in an Amazon review, but I liked him in this.\n",
    "\nThis is the best film I\u0027ve seen in perhaps six months or more.  The direction by Turkish/Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is consistently interesting, intriguing, beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually.  The film is beautifully cut, and the acting, particularly by the fascinating Giovanna Mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also Giovanna, is first rate.  \n\nThe story begins in a bakery during World War II when Davide Veroli (Massimo Girotti) is a baker\u0027s apprentice.  We see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the cave-like establishment.  But he is pounced upon by the baker.  They wrestle, a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on Davide\u0027s hands as he runs out into the streets.\n\nCut to modern times as Giovanna and her working-class husband, Filippo (Filippo Nigro) are crossing a bridge in the city.  They meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented.  He can\u0027t remember his name and he has no identification.  Filippo takes pity on him and against his wife\u0027s wishes takes him home with them to their apartment.  We know because of the man\u0027s age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from World War II.\n\nBut his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about Giovanna\u0027s brief affair with the man next door, Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), whose apartment window faces hers.  This is a love story, a bitter-sweet one--which all great love stories should be in some sense, since life itself is bittersweet.  It is framed by, and contrasted with, another love story, that involving the older man from many years ago.\n\nThe tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married Giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city.  Will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man?  Because the police can find out nothing about the old man, and because Giovanna\u0027s heart softens toward him, and because he is an elegant man of refinement, especially in the pastry arts--Giovanna\u0027s dream is to be a pastry chef--the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship, the old man and the young woman.  \n\nThat\u0027s enough of the plot--the development, the denouement, and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense.  Instead let me say that the feel of modern Italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present.  The dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films.  This is the first film directed by Ozpetek that I have seen, but it won\u0027t be the last.\n\nBut see this for Giovanna Mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen\n",
    "\nThis film is a real delight, but it also has a message about our consumer culture. Don\u0027t miss the deleted scenes: I\u0027m sorry the director cut out the \"saints in the loft\" in particular -- what a powerful image! But it\u0027s there on the DVD -- so enjoy this marvelous charmer of a film\n",
    "\nThis is a very good, well made dvd which is fulled of idea to prepare dinner for your family.\n",
    "\n  I bought this at (yep, you guessed it) the grocery store, which was a very clever marketing concept on Martha\u0027s part. There was only one DVD left. It contained Classic recipes for chicken, beef, fish, vegetarian and other main dishes. If you think you ALREADY know how to make classic, everyday dishes such as meatloaf, think again - because Martha\u0027s variations may put a whole new twist on your usual standards. Her use of fresh herbs truly does make a difference and the glaze on her meatloaf was one I hadn\u0027t tried before. My family loved it. \n\n    There is also a section with Bloopers (yes, Martha\u0027s mistakes or mishaps while filming a scene - slips, falls, etc). There are 12 different cupcake variations and an extra section on kitchen tips (I learned plenty of new things from this section). \n  \n  I have to admit that I looked at the Bloopers section first, intrigued by the idea of actually seeing Martha make mistakes.. and I only wish there were more of those. They were funny, especially the one showing Martha pulling an X-rated carrot from her garden. You\u0027ll have to buy the DVD to see the rest. It is a very short section, however.  \n\n  Then I watched the DVD from start to finish and marveled at the quality of the production, as well as HOW MUCH information was packed into this DVD. From start to finish, each recipe was demonstrated clearly. I intend to use this one with my youngest child because it is a perfect introduction to some classic recipes, from roast chicken to meatloaf. They may not be made the way you are used to making them but in one case that was an advantage...the meatloaf recipe was far better than my standard version and the glaze was delicious (do be aware of your oven\u0027s peculiarities, however, and cover the top to keep the glaze from burning; uncover just long enough to brown). It would be best, of course, to use an oven thermometer and know your oven\u0027s actual temperature since 350 in one oven may not be 350 in another - those dials may be inaccurate. \n\n  But don\u0027t make the mistake of thinking this is only for beginning cooks (although it\u0027d be a perfect housewarming gift for the college graduate who is just setting up house). There are plenty of new recipes, especially a squash casserole which I am dying to try on my vegetarian friends, after having tested it on my family and getting rave reviews. In fact, one of the nicest sections of this DVD was the Vegetarian one. Each of those recipes looked delicious.\n\n   Martha\u0027s mother is featured in some of the segments and that was a pleasant surprise. She and Martha chat as they cook and the whole atmosphere is nice and casual.  \n\n   No matter what you may think of Martha Stewart, this DVD is a top-notch, quality production with tons of useful info. \n\n   The DVD can also be inserted in a computer to get a list of menus and other features. \n\n \n",
    "\nOften overlooked, Robert Altman\u0027s \u0027The Long Goodbye\u0027 is arguably one of THE films exemplifying the 1970s and, although far less dark, ranks alongside Antonioni\u0027s \u0027The Passenger\u0027.\n\nPropelling Marlowe into the opulent, \u0027promise\u0027 of the west coast 1970s USA, Altman allows the story to unfold around a classic murder, mystery story and the stunning cast help to create an atmosphere of parochial \u0027goings-on\u0027 that can subsequently be seen in the works of David Lynch, Tarrantino and, more recently, the \u0027Sopranos\u0027.  The late, great Sterling Hayden gives an unforgetable, bullying, volatile King Lear-like performance as the ageing, impotent, alcoholic writer, and Mark Rydell\u0027s \u0027dangerous\u0027 violent character anticipates that which Martin Scorsese and Joe Pesci create latterly in Goodfellas/Casino. Moreover, there\u0027s an uncredited cameo appearance of a moustachioed Arnold (Schwarzenneger) as a \u0027heavy\u0027. \n\nHowever its Elliiot\u0027s Gould\u0027s brilliant (Oscar deserving) performance as Philip Marlowe that helps to  seal this film\u0027s status into the canon of GREAT films. \nGould creates a sharp, amiable, chain-smoking, wise-cracking 70s detective whose \u0027quirky-alone\u0027 livestyle allow him the freedom to give his own Chandleresque, talking-to-himself dialogue (...\u0027it\u0027s alright by me...\u0027) whilst interacting with a diverse range of characters within the narrative. With respect to this, there\u0027s the continual variation of the haunting melody, \u0027The Long Goodbye\u0027 that is re-worked throughout the film thus floating the narrative structure within changing and moving events and themes yet anchoring it to the overall thread of the story itself.\n\nAltman\u0027s direction is that of a genius at work: the back-drop of the oceanic tug and wash of the tide as seen through the windows of the seductive though manipulative Eilleen Wade\u0027s windows (Nina Van Pallandt), together with slightly surreal and erotic appartment  setting of Marlowe\u0027s flat make this film unforgetable. There\u0027s also the tension associated with the \u0027journeys\u0027 to Mexico: a theme used in more recent (great) films including \u0027Lone Star\u0027; \u0027Traffic\u0027; and, \u0027The Three burials of Melquiades  Estrada\u0027. Who can deny the impact of the opening \u0027cat\u0027 scene and the final \u0027chapter\u0027 of the film  set within the avenue of trees; the \u0027oh-too-late\u0027 figure of Eileen Wade heading in the opposite direction to Marlowe who ironically celebrates his parochial sense of closure by playing the minature harmonica.\n\n If ever a film rated as a \u00276\u0027 for special merit and sheer enjoyment then this is one of the elite few deserving of such an award! I urge you to watch or re-watch this film and savour a work of pure genius. As a commentator and fan of such a seminal film, I can only hope that Robert Altman and-or Elliot Gould can provide a commentary-enhanced (Criterion edition )DVD\n",

The ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go. It is a trance like movie. I found that I couldn\u0027t stop from watching yet, I didnt know why I was watching. Very bizzare, and very mezmerizing. Not a movie that will be enjoyed over and over however.\n",
    "\n9-11 was meticulously planned out by our government. If people do not believe me, go read and study that day like it was your babay and you\u0027ll find the truth. I was a bit skeptical at first as well. Now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in. This isn\u0027t the UNited States of America, this is the beginning of a NEw World Order. Don\u0027t believe me, we\u0027ll probably never know, because we\u0027ll be spoonfed our news on the war in Iraq by the Corporate Media that controls and censors what we see and DON\u0027T SEE! Don\u0027t think so? You, along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in Iraq by watching CNN (Censored News Network), or Fauxnews. It pains me that people still don\u0027t realize that there is no fight for democracy in Iraq. Its a fight for Imperial Ambitions, we need Iraq for Oil, and to set up a puppet government so it doesn\u0027t scare Israel, our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of \"radical muslim fundamentalists.\" No one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself, instead of relying on \"experts\" who \"know\" what is going on. I thought we were intelligent people, us Americans? Most of you can\u0027t even figure out wat the problem really is. Its our corrupt government\n",
    "\nI am a big fan of the book and thought the film version did it justice.  Beautifully filmed; excellent performances\n",
    "\nI read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards.  A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold\u0027s arm drops on Ellie\u0027s shoulder as she\u0027s trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I\u0027ve memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession.\n\nAnd after watching it more than 25 times, I\u0027ve come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He\u0027s as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton\u0027s novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. \"Life finds a way...\"  \n\n(In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and \"random\" --unpredictable-- events result from the \"normal\" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, \"survive,\" in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.)\n\nLove the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.\n\nWe watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I\u0027ve always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond\u0027s live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?).\n\nThe kids were kind of annoying. I didn\u0027t notice this until I was a little older, but Lex (\"I prefer to be called a hacker\") uses Silicon Graphics\u0027 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor. If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now...\n\nAnyway, the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in the mid-90s.  Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994 Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of her excellent music choice\n",
    "\n\"Greetings\" is an offbeat satire from a very young Brian De Palma starring an equally young Robert De Niro.  The vignettes focus on three friends.  First there is Jon Rubin (De Niro), an aspiring filmmaker who has the idea of creating \"peep art.\"  This would consist of filming \"private moments,\" and then letting people view them through tiny windows, thereby re-creating the Peeping Tom experience (more of this in De Palma\u0027s much better 1970 film, \"Hi, Mom!\").  However, if you are expecting to see an amazing performance by one of the great actors of his generation in an early film, you are going to be disappointed.  De Niro comes off as overly mannered and a bit forced in his performance, especially in comparison to his two co-stars.  His best moment is off-screen as he talks a woman through going to bed for his peep art (she repeatedly forgets not to talk).  But he is a lot better two years later and had a decent career, at least until he started making credit card commercials.\n\nFirst there is Lloyd Clay (Gerrit Graham), a conspiracy nut so obsessed with the JFK assassination that a half-naked woman sleeping in his bed is just another opportunity to show that the paths indicated by the bullet holes do not match up (unless JFK was shot while standing on his head).  Lloyd shares his deep, dark thoughts directly with the viewing audience as he argues vigorously to convince us he is right.  But sometimes he finds people in the real world to assault with his blow-ups from the Zapruder film that reduce the assassination to a Rorschach test.  Finally, we have Paul Gerald Shaw (Jonathan Warden), who would like to find the right girl.  His problem is that he has his induction physical and going to Vietnam will really hurt his love life.  Fortunately, Lloyd and Jon are fully of ideas as to how Paul can get the army to reject him, everything from pretending to be gay and coming on to the sergeant (Lloyd\u0027s idea) to volunteering to shoot not only the Vietcong but also any American troops of color (Jon\u0027s brainstorm).  \n\nThere is no real narrative thread here, which is hardly a criticism because \"Greetings\" is more of an ancestor of \"The Groove Tube,\" \"Saturday Night Live,\" and \"Second City TV\" in the history of contemporary sketch comedy with a heavy satirical bent.  The difference is that what De Palma and his friends come up with in \"Greetings\" is more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy.  But there is something compelling about its enthusiasm, which makes us forgive the filmmaker and his actors when things go on a bit too long.  De Palma has admitted to being influenced by Godard and the French \"Nouvelle Vague\" cinema, which inspired going out on the street and trying to improvise scenes (only they did not have enough film to improvise, so they ended up rehearsing most of the film to save money).   But even in this early work, De Palma is clearly into doing everything you can do with a movie camera (inter-titles, split-screen, slow-motion, fast-motion, etc.).\n\n\"Greetings\" is a historical footnote in cinematic history inasmuch as it was the first film in the U.S. to be given an \"X\" rating (later changed to \"R,\" which is what it would qualify today because of some of the shots of nude women).  In terms of social history \"Greetings\" represents some of the counter-culture politics of the late 1960s.  It had been almost thirty years since I first saw \"Greetings\" and \"Hi, Mom!\"  Back then they constituted part of my first real exposure to radical thought in terms of what was out there on the streets.  If you see just one of these films, interested in how De Palma was cutting his teeth as a director before he made his name with \"Carrie\" and \"Dressed to Kill,\" then \"Hi, Mom!\" is the choice (the \"Black in America/Be Black Baby\" bit is the must see segment of that satire).  But if you are interested in De Palma\u0027s career or counter-culture comedy from the late 1960s, then check them both out\n",
    "\nTHis was the first scary movie I ever saw in the cinema, and it made a strong impression on me. The bathtub scenes were so eerie that I only took showers for a few years after I saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me. I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective, although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done. Watching it many years later, I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70\u0027s cheese that you see in many films from that era. The carpet and some of the clothes were funny, but it didn\u0027t detract from the film. Glad I bought it\n",

While some worked well, most of the time they weren\u0027t up to today\u0027s standards.\n\nWhile the main audience might be teen girls, this is one adult male who loved it.

    "\nOnce again the saga of Motoko Kusanagi refuses to fall into the popular mold - as manga, as a pair of feature films, and now a TV series, it combines the classic crowd pleasers of the science fiction of a not too distant time,  a topnotch group of secret agents, and a beautiful woman with a story line that isn\u0027t fraid to stop and contemplate the complicated world where the line between mechanical and human, program and soul, get crossed every day.\n\nWhat you will see for most of these last few episodes is the dismantling of Section 9 when their efforts to get to the bottom of the Secretary General\u0027s plot result in danger to the nations politicians.

First the ethical questions raised by the Laughing Man and human cyberization, then the even more difficult issues of what life is or can be.

She is a modern Tomoe Gozen, unendingly loyal to Arimaki and fiercely defiant in battle.  \n\nThis has been a series with considerable depth that echoes but never slavishly imitates, the work that has gone before.

    "\nSUNSET BOULEVARD is a drama that reveals the unsightly day-to-day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense.

The girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on SUNSET BOULEVARD is a formidable challenge. \n\nWith some of the most memorable quotes in Hollywod, this is a wonderfully produced \"noir-comic\" drama by Billy Wilder that well projects the intense emotions, not only of each character, but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent. Other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are ALL ABOUT EVE, AN IMITATION OF LIFE, and WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE. A gem on the DVD extras is the history of fashion legend Edith Head.\n\nMovie quote: \"There\u0027s nothing tragic about being fifty. Not unless you\u0027re trying to be twenty-five.\n",
    "\nThis movie is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Christopher Nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies.  This movie is very unique and will never get old\n",
    "\nI grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....  \n\nThe cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful.\n\nOK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70\u0027s flick \"The Deep\" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let\u0027s face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.  \n\nOverall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.   \n\n",
    "\nThis film is the best film that Disney has in it\u0027s live-action collection! Every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life. I really like all the extras on the disc as well I like seeing how the film was created, looking at deleted scenes, learning about the history of real pirates, and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of Walt Disney himself\n",
    "\nUpdate (Jan 27, 2006):\nI am still waiting for this 3-pack placed last October. I have repeatedly asked the company to delete items listed on its website that it does not have. I am glad that Amazon has finally removed its original listing of this 3-pack (NEW) from its website.\nJan 27, 2006\n\nI am still waiting for this 3-pack to be delivered for, initially, the Thanksgiving holiday, followed by, as promised by representatives of Amazon, Christmas.

    "\nIN A NUTSHELL: UNDERRATED - UNDERVALUED - UNDEREXPOSED - \n\nExcellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event! It is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box-office.\n\nHarrison Ford and Liam Neeson are ideally suited as Soviet naval Captains, and as believable as their rebuilt authentic K-19! Kathryn Bigelow who Directed and Produced the film did an incredible job, which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the DVD. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: THIS NEW KIND OF SUB FILM IS A PART OF HISTORY\n\nIf you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best. If you enjoy thrillers, this film delivers enough edge-of-your-seat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine-movie and thriller-enthusiast in anyone.\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve seen the Pilates infomercials for a while now, but have been intimidated by the seemingly impossible movements. When I found this inexpensive \"For Dummies\" DVD, I decided to give it a try. WHAT A WORKOUT! I consider myself to be in moderately good shape, and this workout can definitely be felt! Within the first couple of days I IMMEDIATELY noticed a change in my posture, and a good burn in my abs, hips and thighs. I HIGHLY recommend this as both a great workout and a wonderful intro to Pilates.\n",

    "\nNewman, Redford, Robert Shaw as the bad guy, twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so...how can anyone not like \"The Sting\"? When I saw it on the big screen upon its first release, I did not think it deserved the Oscar as best film of its year, although I enjoyed it. Now, decades later, and after having seen it perhaps 20 times, at least in pieces, I think it one of the best achievements in movie-making in its century. It has STYLE, and a consistent sensibility, and logic, and on first viewing, it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top. I can\u0027t imagine that anyone over 30 hasn\u0027t seen it yet, but if that\u0027s you, fix it as soon as possible. It is a primer in how to write, direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience. Newman\u0027s drunken card-player on the train with Shaw is absolutely classic\n",
    "\nHector Elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill.  Aside from his superlative work as a Doctor on \"Chicago Hope\" he has been often cast as a sideman in films - the trusted aide, the sympathetic boss - but often in supporting roles.  In \"Tortilla Soup\" he takes the leading role in a Mexican-American remake of Ang Lee\u0027s \"Eat Drink Man Woman\".   \n\nHe plays Martin Naranjo, a Mexican Chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist.  The movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared, then eaten, that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen.  Martin is has lost much of his sense of taste, which he thinks is a cruel irony, but his Cuban partner reminds him that Beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing.  Martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago.  Elizabeth Pena is Leticia, the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple \"grace\" into mini-sermons.  Jacqueline Obradors is the saucy Carmen, who was encouraged to get her MBA by Martin, but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion - as her father did with his wondrous cooking.  Tamara Mello is the youngest Maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to \"find herself\".  Constance Marie is family friend Yolando, who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who Martin dotes on.  Raquel Welch is Yolando\u0027s mother, Hortensia, who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished Martin.   \n\nThe film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions.  At the beginning of the film all of the characters are single.  By the end they\u0027ve all been paired off in one manner or another, some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others.  Raquel Welch is a bit of a distraction in the film.  At age 61 she has a show-stopping beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25.  In a film full of attractive performers she doesn\u0027t \"look her age\" enough to blend into the story.  She plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester. \n\nThe movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and I would recommend it if only to watch Hector Elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen.\n",
    "\nIt is the ultima of CGI video game movies. I must buy for Final Fantasy addicts.\n",
    "\nIf you love John Waters then you\u0027re already right there with me.  I would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie Grease but is a more self-aware film.\n\nI love rooting for the Drapes and the idea that the Squares can become Drapes, which, thematically, seems to be a Waterian theme - that we can all get along if we have sex with each other.  Which is probably true John.\n\nOh yeah, and Johnny Depp is young here and cool and I think you will enjoy seeing both Ricki Lake and Tracy Lords and Willem Dafoe as well (I know I did)\n",
    "\nAlthough subtitled Grazia\u0027s island (Grazia is the lead role, magnificently realized by Valeria Golino), \"Respiro\" could have well been called \"Scenes from rural Sicilian life\", as the scenography, cinematography and tableaux-like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line. Respiro\u0027s locale is Lampedusa, a tiny island far off the west coast of Sicily. About the same latitude as Malta, this place is about as remote as it gets - Tunisia is closer than Palermo. It can be safe to say that Italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades; this is Italy of de Sica and Mascagni, not Fellini and Prada. The men go out to sea, the children play, women pack fish, old black-clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky.\n\nThroughout this film you would probably ask yourself, \"Is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited?\" It\u0027s a fairly typical story, the type that a few great (and many, many average) Italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations - life in the sun drenched rural, ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds. How long since \"Cinema Paradiso?\"\n\nWhat I like most about the movie, besides the appealing scenery, was the interrelations of the characters, the humor, petty gossips, the impromptu emotional outbursts, the displays of maternal and filial affection. The two boys are tremendous: the older Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) is the more mature of the two. The younger Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings, often without sense. His rant against the busybody women is a treasure, as is his little-brother-as-big-brother protectiveness of his sister from the policeman-friend. The boy embodies an epic Italianate inflammability far beyond his years. While viewing this I thought the son\u0027s affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times. They do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village.\n\nAfter seeing this film, I have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar, the differences are in the languages, but the feelings are same.  I enjoyed this film so much I might see it a couple of times.\n",
    "\nRESPIRO is one of those Italian treasures of a film, this time written and directed by the insightful Emanuele Crialese, that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and  foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story.  RESPIRO mixes the gut-level Italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by Fellini.\n\nLampedusa is a Mediterranean island between Sicily and Tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of Italy to be a return to the native.  The population is all involved in fishing.  On this picturesque island lives Grazia (the beautiful and talented Valeria Golina) who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality.  She lives happily with her fisherman husband Pietro and her children: teenage Marinella (Veronica D\u0027Agostini), Pasquale (Frncesco Casisa - a very fine little actor!) and Filippo (Filippo Pucillo).  The boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother\u0027s wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace.  \n\nWhen Grazia\u0027s actions come under scrutiny by Pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother (Muzzi Loffredo) who occasionally gives Grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests Grazia needs psychiatric help in Milan, Grazia runs away to hide in a grotto, her whereabouts are known only to Pasquale.\n\nThe little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of Grazia, only to discover on St Bartolo\u0027s Day that Grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean.  How this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie: revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of RESPIRO.  Suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away!\n\nThis little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography - both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean - of any film you\u0027ll see.  The music by John Surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric.  The way director Crialese  captures the folklore-like behavior of the youngsters\u0027 games, and the married-to-the-sea philosophy of the villagers, is utterly magical.  This is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society.  RESPIRO is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to Eden.  In Italian with English subtitles.   Grady Harp, November 200\n",
    "\nI enjoy all three of the the Jurassic Park movies, though I think \u0026quot;The Lost World\u0026quot; is a bit weak.  While I think that anyone who enjoys action movies, monster movies, or horror movies should own all three, I find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies, but a fourth DVD containing substantial background information on the making of the movies.  I give this collection four stars only because the larger, more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two, you will definitely like the third movie\n",
    "\nNow it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004.  A relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them.  \n\nBob Roberts, a son of a hippy couple rebels against that world view and uses music as a means of spreading conservative propaganda.  Marketing hate and intolerance in the flag, this movie frighteningly shows in fiction what is being done in reality today.  \n\nI think Bob Roberts will be a movie that historians will study 200 years ago and see it relevant for discussion of the United States around the turn of the millenium. \n",
    "\nIf you are not familiar with research, this nice approach to a scientist\u0027s  work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies. Besides, this very interesting and moving film, with  high level and homogeneous performances, will show, the closest it can, the early facts about such a terrible disease. I strongly recommend it. I have seen it with my 16 year old son, but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age. A bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience.\n",

    "\nWatch this and be inspired by the awesome Herbie Hancock.  The recording sessions are great.  The music and the movie flow along like a terrific jazz solo, riffing on all kinds of themes but Herbie brings it together into a whole.  Just watching him play on the piano is a treat.  If you\u0027re not that familiar with this living jazz legend, check this out and you\u0027ll admire both the man and his music\n",
    "\nYour milage may vary; but I found this movie white-knuckle intense and extremely provocative.  There is little danger of giving away the plot; it is not particularly complex.  Three stupid, arrogant American teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from Finland to the former USSR, which at the time was very much the USSR and a Very Bad Place for Americans.  They make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate.  So far so good, but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the Russians who mistake them for spies.  Some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving, that I\u0027ll keep a secret for ya.  I can promise you one thing:  If you are American, after seeing this, you\u0027ll salute the flag, think real hard before traveling overseas and I\u0027ll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border\n",
    "\nBruce Almighty is a great movie. It about a newsreporter, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), that has a bad day a work(gets fired) and thinks that God is punishing him. So God (Morgan Freedman) meets him at a warehouse and tell Bruce that he can have all his powers. Then Bruce has fun with the God powers gets his job back, but sometimes its hard to be God. You\u0027ll have to watch the rest of the movie to find the rest out. :)\nTheir are some great parts in the movie like when he gets a monkey to crawl out of a guys butt, when he gets prayers, it saids \"You got prayers\" instead of \"you got mail\".\nOverall the story was pretty good and funny. If you want to have some good laughs and giggles, watch this and some scenes are not appropriate with children. hehe. Though it is PG-13.\nRating 9.2/1\n",
    "\nHere is the reason why somebody like Bruce cannot be a God. Simply because the world would suck!!! And his life too. It\u0027s a very good movie. It shows that people can\u0027t always have what they want. Very interesting and unpredictable plot. Hilarious\n",

    "\nIn some of Fred Astaire\u0027s movies there\u0027s only one excellent reason to watch, and that\u0027s to watch Fred Astaire. In You Were Never Lovelier there are three other excellent reasons. Rita Hayworth. Jerome Kern. Johnny Mercer. The four of them have concocted a romantic and funny South American fable that features some great dancing by both Astaire and Hayworth and some memorable songs by Kern and Mercer.\n\nEduardo Acuna (Adolphe Menjou), a wealthy Buenos Aires businessman, has four beautiful daughters, and in the Acuna family they must marry in age order. The eldest fulfills her responsibilities and the two youngest have beaus they\u0027re now anxious to share vows with. But the second eldest, Maria (Rita Hayworth) is in no hurry. She wants romance and charm and the men she meets are just panting boys. Then she sees Robert Davis (Fred Astaire), a very charming, down-on-his-luck dancer, singing Dearly Beloved at her elder sister\u0027s wedding. He tries to chat her up; she stares him down. Then the plot intervenes. Before long she knows what she wants. Robert knows what he wants. Eduardo Acuna knows what he doesn\u0027t want...a down-on-his-luck dancer in the family. From then on it\u0027s songs, dances, romance and misunderstandings, which moves into songs, dances and romance. The plot feels sluggish at times and there\u0027s way too much Xavier Cugat and his orchestra, but Astaire and Hayworth are at their peak, Kern has written some memorable melodies and few could top Mercer at lyric writing, none in Hollywood.\n\nHayworth not only was a gorgeous creature, she was a gifted dancer; many think she was the best Astaire worked with. Technically, she not only handled the steps Astaire created, she did so without a hint of effort. After you\u0027ve watched the dances a couple of times, go back and watch again, but this time concentrate on her face and her hand and arm action. She gives every indication of being utterly relaxed and enjoying herself, even in the fast tap routines. She seems naturally to find the most graceful attitude for an extended arm, a turn of her head, a raised hand. She may not be quite as good as Astaire, but she\u0027s good enough.\n\nAmong the stand-out routines are:\n--The Audition Dance. Robert shows up at Acuna\u0027s office and demands a chance to show his stuff as a dancer. From there Astaire takes off on a fast tap routine that takes him all over the floor, onto Acuna\u0027s desk, the sofa and chairs. He works into the dance a cane, a rug, the drapes and Acuna\u0027s head. \n\n--I\u0027m Old Fashioned. This is probably the best romantic wooing dance Astaire did. It\u0027s all fluid motion and spontaneous recognition, danced on the elegant, polished outdoor landing of Acuna\u0027s mansion. Rita Hayworth is a vision, and matches him step for step. We move from Maria declaring with humor and assurance that Robert\u0027s the man for her, to Robert\u0027s protestation that he\u0027s just a guy from Omaha, Nebraska, to the dance that brings them closer and closer together until we know through the dance that a love match has just happened. The funny exit through the doors and back into the living-room, bumping into each other, each giving way, bumping again and then going in together arm in arm hits just the right note. The dance works so well in part because Kern and Mercer came up with a classic:\nI\u0027m old fashioned,\nI love the moonlight,\nI love the old fashioned things.\nThe sound of rain\nUpon a window pane,\nThe starry song that April sings.\nThis year\u0027s fancies\nAre passing fancies\nBut sighing sighs, holding hands,\nThese my heart understands.\nI\u0027m old fashioned\nBut I don\u0027t mind it.\nThat\u0027s how I want to be,\nAs long as you agree,\nTo stay old fashioned with me.\n\n--The Shorty George. This fast tap routine starts out with Maria visiting Robert at a rehearsal. He sings The Shorty George and she takes a couple of lines. He looks surprised that she knows the song. He starts to dance and invites her to join him. Hayworth stays right with Astaire and looks like she\u0027s having the time of her life.\n\n--You Were Never Lovelier. Robert declares his feelings for Maria, but more misunderstandings occur. Finally, everything is resolved. Robert shakes off some knight\u0027s armor he was wearing (there is sort of a reason) and appears below Maria\u0027s bedroom window in black tie. She rushes down...and off they go dancing while all the members of the Acuna family look on approvingly. And the Johnny Mercer lyrics and Jerome Kern music brings us to the happy end:\nYou were never lovelier, you were never so fair; \nDreams were never lovelier,\nPardon me if I stare.\nDown the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;\nI can only say they chose the proper place.\nYou were never lovelier, and to coin a new phrase, \nI was never luckier\nIn my palmiest days.\nMake a note, and you can quote me, honor bright,\nYou were never lovelier than you are tonight\n",
    "\nCITY BY THE SEA is a movie that is propelled by its rich performances, particularly those of Robert DeNiro and Frances McDormand. Both Oscar winners, they infuse their characters with such humanity and imperfection, they make this movie much better than it would have been in other hands. James Franco, although obviously \u0026quot;in\u0026quot; to his performance, comes across attempting to repeat his Emmy award winning role as James Dean. The mannerisms, the false bravado, the hurt and pinched face, are trademarks of the late Dean, and Franco seems to enjoy using them again. William Forsythe approaches a caricature of his role, but it\u0027s still spinetingling enough to make your skin crawl. Anson Mount as the moralistic cop Dave Simond, gives a strong, understated performance, showing that all cops aren\u0027t bad. George Dzundza as DeNiro\u0027s partner is also good, as is Linda Emon, as his wife in a very touching and sad scene where DeNiro confronts her after Dzunda\u0027s death---apparently at the hands of DeNiro\u0027s son.\n The movie is to be commended for giving us characters with flaws, and in understanding the way some relationships never fully materialize or heal.\n The film has some marvelous cinematography of the old Asbury Park area, and has an ending that while not totally satisfying is real.\n A good movie\n",
    "\nRather than \"Menace to Society\", this movie should be titled, \"The Unfortunate Victims of a Racist Society\". My heart bleeds for the real-world counterparts of these young men, caught up in the unending battle for survival in South-central LA, and other such areas all around the country.\n\nI understand that we all make choices, but how many do these young men have? It is a racist, exclusionary society that has condemned them to their fate; to die violently at the hands of their own brothers. Its sickening. Society is more of a menace to these young men, than they are responsible for being a menace to society.\n\nHaving said that, the movie itself is excellent. It\u0027s gritty and real to the \u0027nth\u0027 degree. Movies like this should be a huge wakeup call for the \u0027powers that be\u0027 in this country, but the reality is that the grave lessons it teaches will pass unnoticed\n",
    "\nI wanted to see a movie one evening, and it really didn\u0027t matter what movie, I just wanted to get out of the house, and get to a theater. I looked at the listings and decided to see \"In Good Company\", and I\u0027m certainly glad I did. I found this movie to be very entertaining, and very enjoyable to watch. I thought this movie really showed a new edge to Scarlett Johansson as well. \nIn a way this movie was also an eye-opener on todays\u0027 corporate America, and its\u0027 all too often pitfalls. Nicely produced, acted, and directed.\n",
    "\nEddie dies and goes to heaven where he learns his life has been meaningful to at least 5 people. I enjoyed watching this movie, and I feel it allows us to appreciate the little things done for others...not making us feel guilty because we did not change the world with a bang.\n",
    "\nThis is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it when it first came out and ten years later it\u0027s still just as funny. Basic plot: Ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he\u0027s ALONE on New Year\u0027s night. Anyone who\u0027s had a bad night/day on the job can relate to Ted as he encounters the most \u0027unusual\u0027 situations. From the witches who need his \u0027secret\u0027 ingredient to make their potion, to a gangster\u0027s bratty kids, a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken Hollywood people who want to make Ted part of their hazardous (and very gross) bet. I don\u0027t want to give too much away but I will say that I will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever. If you love a good, dark comedy this is the movie for you\n",
    "\nThis set is one of the better Jurassic Park sets.  Each disk contains a lot of extras, many of which are fun to watch.  Fans of the trilogy that have yet to buy the DVDs will find this set a great one to have.\n\n\"Jurassic Park\" introduced us to digital dinosaurs and how fearsome they could be with modern computer technology. This movie advanced horror and monster movies in a method similar to the way \"Alien\" advanced science fiction movies. \"Jurassic Park\" immediately became an audience favorite and the new standard by which special effects would be judged. Stephen Spielberg effectively combined in-your-face terror with special effects to keep people at the edge of their seats and in awe of life-like creatures dinosaurs.\n\n\"The Lost World\" unfortunately did not measure up to \"Jurassic Park.\" Many of the characters were unbelievable and there were too many plot holes that were too readily visible to make the movie enjoyable from beginning to end. While there were several parts of the movie that were well-done, there were at least as many parts where the actions of the characters were unrealistic. The bumps in the actions of the characters just did not allow me to focus on the plot throughout. Another problem with this movie is that it focused too much on action, and very little on the characters themselves. Thus, the movie comes across as more of a cartoon than a horror movie.\n\n\"Jurassic Park III\" simplified the plot, added new dinosaurs, and allowed the characters to develop more than \"The Lost World.\" The short length of the movie forced the movie to be simpler than the previous movie, and that simplicity makes for a good movie. The best new dinosaur in this movie had to be the pteranodons, though the spinosaur was great also. The characters in this movie generally acted as I would expect them to, and there were fewer outright acts of stupidity. Even the theft of a raptor egg was done in ignorance. So while it was a convenient plot device, you would expect something like that by someone with only minimal knowledge of dinosaurs. I was very happy to see Sam Neill returning in the role of Dr. Alan Grant. His character particularly is very believable.\n\nEnjoy!\n",
    "\nI loved Ben Vereen in the show. Wanted the music for my ipod, too. Very satisfie\n",
    "\nThis show undoubtly is one of the greatest around.  I have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give American\u0027s their own Monty Python show and they failed because their show is BETTER than Monty Python.  Their show is not BETTER, it is of equal and noteworthy standing.  Monty Python is history that will never been changed.  They have gone on to do many other creative things.  Bob Odenkirk is doing Miller Lite commercials and I hope he does something like David has with his new appearance in Arrested Development.  I can honestly say that this show is not better, yet it is close, to Monty Pythons Flying Circus.  Both are great shows. \n\nIt is full of hillarious sketches and original ideas that is for sure and if you haven\u0027t yet, go buy the other seasons and add to your growing comedy sets because you won\u0027t regret adding this\n",
    "\nHospitals are inherently spooky.  Scenes of so much pain and death, the very walls soaking up the agony through the years, they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there.  The hospital in \"Infection\" (\"Kansen\") is in particularly bad shape. Losing money, unable to keep staff, the doctors and nurses working there are under-qualified and desperate.  Into this unstable environment comes a strange patient, with a black, infectious rash.  Slowly, the rash spreads, revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human\u0027s body, slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation.  But all is not as it seems, even then.\n\nI\u0027m impressed that, even watching as much J-Horror as I do, \"Infection\" still managed to creep me out.  It was unexpectedly good.  Director Masayuki Ochiai knows the things in a hospital that can make you cringe, and he uses them to their fullest extent.  He also keeps you guessing as to exactly what kind of horror movie this is.  Is it about a devastating biological infection?  Are those ghosts?  Is that a serial killer?  All of his images and slow revelations of the story keep making less and less sense, disorientating you just when you think you have a handle on it, until the final page is revealed and it all comes crashing home.\n\n\"Infection\" isn\u0027t quite a gross-out flick, like \"Ichi the Killer,\" but it definitely relies on visual shock for its scares while keeping a good atmosphere.  If anything, it manages to combine the creepy mood of J-Horror ghost films like \"Ring\" while still delivering on cringe-worthy gore.  One scene in particular had me going.  When you see the movie, you will know what it was.\n\nAs part of the \"J-Horror Theater\" series, and directer by a relatively new-comer who\u0027s experience has mainly been doing horror TV shows, I didn\u0027t have high expectations for this film.  I thought it would be a cheap job, done to cash in on the current J-Horror fad.  I was wrong. It is quite a well made little horror flick, not outstanding or groundbreaking, but really excellent for what it is\n",

    "\nAt Ikiru\u0027s opening, I started to have real doubts about the film. I had heard that this was Kurosawa\u0027s best, and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down.\n\nLuckily, that didn\u0027t happen.\n\nThe narrator of the film reminded me of Criswell\u0027s narrations to Plan 9 from Outer Space. The film seemed to say too much and show too little. Then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero Mr. Watanabe at work, something clicked. The long duration of the shot and the narrator\u0027s continued breakdown of the man\u0027s less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives, that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds, and that we are powerless to silence it.\n\nThat floored me, and for the rest of the film, I remained awe-stricken by this humble yet miserable man. Takashi Shimura gives one of the greatest performances I\u0027ve seen since Raging Bull. Here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world, but he\u0027s smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt. The horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time.\n\nThere are points at which the film seems to drag on, but never without purpose. When he dies, having finally given meaning to his existence, his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity, confusion, and finally admiration. The scene lags, which makes us that much more insulted by their ignorance\n",
    "\nThis is a great film that preceded the onset of the \"JLo.\"  \"Out of Sight\" is a great showcase for Jennifer Lopez\u0027s talent as an actress.  It is a shame that she hasn\u0027t been presented with more great roles, like that of Karen Sisco, in this film.  Karen is a D.A, who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude. She has a chance encounter with charming, compulsive bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney).  Their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping of Sisco in her OWN car. It is no surprise that sparks fly.....however, this doesn\u0027t downplay the complexities of their star-crossed encounter.  \n\nSome of the greatest strong points of this film include the juxtaposition of flashbacks, incorporating trick camera work and voice overs.  What\u0027s more, this film was shot in a very bare bones style.  We don\u0027t get a sense of romance, so much as a feeling of stark reality.  The colors are dark, the dialogue between the characters is honest, real and simply wonderful.  This film has a potential for mass appeal, due to the fact that, though it does get gritty and violent, that doesn\u0027t downplay its intelligence or originality.  Violence is counterbalanced by genuinely funny scenes, as well as more introspective glimpses at how the characters turned out as they did.  This is definitely a great date film!!\n",
    "\nThis was one of the best movies of 1998, but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience.  When I try to think of superlatives to desribe it, the one that keeps coming to mind is \"cool.\"\n\nMost of the coolness factor is owed to two things:  Steven Soderbergh\u0027s steady directing and the chemistry between the actors, especially George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Back before we knew that Clooney would go on to channel the same character in virtually all of his roles, he defined suave in this movie.  And back before she was J.Lo, Lopez was that IN LIVING COLOR fly girl with the big ole butt trying to make a name for herself as a film actress.  Here she gives the best performance of her career.\n\nWhile all of the cast (Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks and Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson in cameos) is solid, after Clooney and Lopez the real star is Don Cheadle.  He is quite convincing as the prison boxer Snoopy.  He oozes rage and steals every scene that he\u0027s in.\n\nPlots based on books by Elmore Leonard tend to be above average, but are mostly dependent upon the colorful characters he writes.  Thanks to the talent of all involved, this movie is one of the best\n",
    "\nI didn\u0027t think it would be that great and only saw it for Joshua Jackson, but the plot twists were really good and I enjoyed it a lot. And of course, Kate Hudson, whom I adore, (even though I didn\u0027t pay much attention to her in this one). But yeah, I really liked the end. And this is where I first heard of Norman Reedus. Then I saw the Boondock Saints. :-D This is a good movie and is very underappreciated. \n",
    "\nWOW. This movie is outrageous. It was a great movie for both Ice Cube and Mike Epps. They were both great in Next Friday, so I was ready for this movie.

Graphic wise, 2nd gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie, the CG is allot more fine-tuned and the action is awesome!!!, the opener has also improved significantly for the series!!!, Sound wise the series is awesome as usual 5.1 DTS Japanese \u0026 5.1 DTS English, with stereo for both and there are English subtitles if you chose to run it with Japanese audio. \nOverall they squealed SAC season 1 perfectly, this not a series to miss if you\u0027re a shell fan!   \n",

    "\nI first watched this performance on PBS Great Performances. It is amazing. I\u0027m very happy to finally find a complete version of the stage show on DVD. Rachel York does a top-notch performance in the leading role. The rest of the cast is up to par. There have been other reviews that say the music is dated, or other such nonsense, but do not pay heed to them. Premiered in 1948, the musical is based on The Taming of the Shrew (Shakespeare),  and the music and lyrics are done by Cole Porter. Sometimes referred to as his masterpiece (which I agree with), the production never drags or disappoints. The lyrics are extremely witty (a trademark of Porter). The music keeps you humming along for days.\n",
    "\nThis show is great. The 5th Season was considered so-so by critics but it is truely halarious. See \u0027The Ski Lift\u0027 for a classic Curb episode\n",
    "\nHappiness can be delicate. In just one swoop, it can stolen out from under you, just when you least expect it. The results can be often devastating - some can never recover. The family in the Italian film The Son\u0027s Room has found such happiness, but when tragedy suddenly strikes, they\u0027re engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache.\n\nGrief is perhaps the most tangled of human emotions, and the vagaries of sadness, love, and anger that comprise its essence are often very difficult to portray. Luckily, co-writer, director, and actor Nanni Moretti avoids all the usual clichs in this delicately nuanced and subtly acted film. The Son\u0027s Room is indeed a moving and weighty depiction of one family\u0027s attempts to heal after sudden death strikes them. \n\nMoretti stars as Giovanni, a successful psychiatrist with a busy practice treating the assorted neurotics of the picture-perfect Northern Italian coastal town he and his family call home. Giovanni is a mild-mannered and kindly man, who has a sort of passive and submissive approach to living. \n\nGiovanni also has a lovely family: he\u0027s happily married to gorgeous book publisher Paola (Laura Morante) and shares what he considers a close relationship with his teenaged daughter Irene (Jasmine Trinca) and son Andrea (Giuseppe Sanfelice). \n\nHe presides over his wife and two children with a kind of flaccid authority, enveloping them with the same deceptively passive doctoral concern with which he counsels his psychiatric patients. He supports, and heals, less by what he says than by what he doesn\u0027t say. He quietly coaches Andrea in soccer moves, while encouraging Irene to be more competitive at basketball. \n\nPerhaps it\u0027s an ominous portent of what is to come, but the film opens as Andrea and his friends have been accused of stealing a valuable fossil from the school\u0027s Science department. Giovanni and Paola are surprised to find they entertaining the idea that their son may in fact be guilty as charged. However, no one takes the incident that seriously.\n\nIf this is the only drama that affects Giovanni\u0027s serene life, nothing prepares him for the sudden tragedy that occurs one sunny Sunday afternoon. Called away from home by a desperate client, Giovanni cancels his plans to go jogging with Andrea; and it\u0027s a fatal choice that haunts him for months to come. \n \nThe accident, when it happens, is so unexpected. The loss giving rise to sorrow, rage, tenderness, and the inexplicable feeling that hope is no longer possible. The family, emotionally fractured, is unable to continue on. Plunged into unimaginable grief, Giovanni attempts to carry on with his life, but bereft of his objectivity, he finds he\u0027s no longer able to function as an analyst.\n\nThe Son\u0027s Room, with it\u0027s subtle acting and its pensive, emotionally layered story, remains a startling testament to the delicate nuances of grief. And it\u0027s as though Moretti has invited the viewer to spy on a deeply personal event in the life of a very ordinary family. Like a fly on the wall we witness the sadness, the regret, the empty dinners and the overwhelming feeling of whether they could have done anything to stop the accident. \n\nMoretti, whose eyes glitter with knowledge from within a bland, bearded, professorial face, gives a wonderful performance, as does the classy Morente as the beautiful, anguished Paola. While Giovanni wanders dazed through a theme park, numb to the grief, Paola fields a desire to talk about the absent child. \n\nA savior for the family arrives in a letter addressed to the deceased, and when the writer appears on the family\u0027s doorstep, she offers the grace note that reminds them of the means by which happiness eventually repairs itself and the unavoidable fact that life goes on. There\u0027s no catharsis here, only a heartfelt exploration of what it means to grieve. Mike Leonard August 05. \n",
    "\nThis series is awesome, and I am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over.  It speaks to the depths of the soul of a man.  Having experienced intense pain, though not in war, I find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series.  This bonding is what men were meant to do, not just in war, but in our every day battles.  The sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional.  I recommend this for any group of buddies, or even church groups\n",
    "\nVery good acting and a fantastic script put this movie at the top of the list of must see movies of this decade.\n\nYou have to decide for yourself about the spiritual quality and message but I personally thought it was well done.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix puts in his usual top notch performance\n",
    "\nNot only does the movie Signs offer a wonderfully different kind of alien/ufo tale, but its characters are very likable and the story is about much more than aliens from another planet. The story\u0027s true question is this: does everything just happen by chance, or is God caring for His children in ways they simply cannot understand? Signs is the story of hope lost, faith put aside because of intense pain and grief, and how one man\u0027s relationship with God affects the lives of those around him. We were amazed by how truly moving this film is, as well as how humorous it can be, and we were impressed with the acting of all the cast. Does everything just happen by chance, or is God caring for His children in ways they simply cannot understand?\n",
    "\nThis movie is obviously not for everyone. It\u0027s not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour\u0027s. Nope, instead you get the muscle a-cranking. Huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in. This film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart, soul, and body of every other thing in existence in an ever-changing world. This film is a big orgy of questioning. And who doesn\u0027t like questioning? This film, in its own right, is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films.\n\n\"Huckabees\" offers us an impressive cast with Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Mark Wahlberg, Isabelle Huppert (one of my favorite international actress\u0027s) and Naomi Watts. Most notable performances by, namely, Dustin Hoffman as it\u0027s nice to see him in an exceptional role. He hasn\u0027t really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997\u0027s \"Wag the Dog.\" It\u0027s very nice to see Hoffman play a great character, as Bernard, the quirky husband half of the existential detectives. Also, most notable is the performance of Mark Wahlberg, as Tommy Corn, another client of the detectives that befriends Albert. Tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather, rides a bike to the fire saying, \"We\u0027d all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum.\" Mark Wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Three Kings.\" However, this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else. The ensemble\u0027s performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless. \n\nThe most credit to this movie goes to writer/director David O. Russell. Russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story. But the story is amazingly written. The script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that.\n",

    "\nOne thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years.  What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now.  In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now.  \n\nFox had something good cooking with Arrested Development.  It seems whenever a show doesn\u0027t get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings.  It VERY rarely works, and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this.  \n\nI can\u0027t blame Fox for pulling the plug.  After all, they tried their hardest to promote the show.  I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in.  The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air.  It\u0027s just unfortunate people didn\u0027t want to watch it.  I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy, Arrested Development would be around today.  \n\nAs it stands, 53 episodes are all we have of this great show.  Honestly, it\u0027s not enough, but will have to do.  \n\nDo we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies?  Aren\u0027t there more than enough of them on the air now?  Most of these shows people won\u0027t even recognize when they hear the name of them because there\u0027s so many.  Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same, and they blend together.  One plainly obvious joke after another.  I\u0027m bored just thinking about it.  We\u0027ve reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot, and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move, in my opinion.  The times need to change.  \n\nPeople make a big deal about Arrested Development because there\u0027s really NOTHING else like it on television.  That\u0027s why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon.  People wouldn\u0027t be praising the show so much if there wasn\u0027t a good reason for it.  Trust me, there\u0027s a reason for all the positive reviews.  Buy one of the DVD season sets, pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, watch the show *carefully* and experience the joy so many people are raving about. \n",

    "\nIn the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from Andy Griffith in 1957\u0027s \"A Face in the Crowd\", master director Elia Kazan gets similarly stellar results from Natalie Wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920\u0027s Kansas. In the same year as her Maria in \"West Side Story\", she has never been more affecting then she is here as Deanie Loomis, the local butcher\u0027s daughter deeply in love with Bud Stamper, the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero. They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry, but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents.\n\nThe ruling moral code restricts Deanie more than Bud who ends up cavorting with a good-time girl named Juanita. The indiscretion overwhelms Deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state. A few years later with their lives on divergent paths, they meet again to come to terms with each other. While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan\u0027s sure hand and William Inge\u0027s screenplay (his first directly for the screen), it\u0027s the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue. Otherwise, there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955\u0027s \"Picnic\" based on Inge\u0027s successful Broadway play.\n\nAt her most beautiful, Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned. As the none-too-bright Bud, Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie\u0027s powerful fixation completely understandable. There are several standout performances among the supporting cast with Audrey Christie pitch-perfect as Deanie\u0027s unsympathetic mother, Pat Hingle in blowhard mode as Bud\u0027s power-hungry father, and Zohra Lampert as Angie, the self-effacing waitress Bud meets at Yale. The classic Wordsworth poem from which the film\u0027s title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie, and I still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time I see this movie.

A fabulous and totally hillarious walk thru of all the songs on the DVD. I can think of no other band that has the ability to laugh at themselves like these guys do. That humor along with superior musicianship makes them as well as this DVD a must have!\n",
    "\nThe boys take the stage on their hometown for a \"silver\" anniversary concert and pull out all the stops. Guest stars abound along with a host of other musicians add to the celebration and the crowd was indeed rabid. All the songs are represented here that CT fans expect and are delivered with verve. All band members are represented here, and even former bassist Jon Brandt joins in for his album cuts. The DVD offers up a nice selection of extras including Rick Nielson hamming it up for the camera off stage (and on stage of course). Cheap Trick wails and all is right in the world. Now for the negatives from this release. Sound is just okay, after some heavy EQ work I was able to get a very good sound from my Sony 5.1 system, but camera work is indeed lacking. Cameras used for long shots had badly overexposed pictures much of the time and many of the handheld shots were in wrong position, but that may have been an editing problem. All in all I give the performance 5-stars and production 3 stars (a very generous 3-stars). \n",
    "\nThis 1954 musical release is just too good/too fun to pass up. Adam (Howard Keel - oh my god, what a voice) needs a wife and zeros in on Milly (Jane Powell) to drag back to his Oregon Territory farm and six unruly brothers. The tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge. Milly makes believers out of them. The brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town. Whoops, they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets snowed-in for winter.\n\nThe songs are lovely, the story charming, but it\u0027s the dance choreography that brings me back again and again. There are two numbers in particular which showcase the brothers\u0027 dance skills, and they are outstanding. Julie Newmar of Catwoman fame is one of the kidnapped cuties. They stick her in the back or whisk her out completely for the more involved dance routines, but who cares, it\u0027s Julie Newmar\n",

Both movies are pretty similar to each other... but \"Blood In, Blood Out\" kinda focuses on the 3 brothers, and the paths each of them takes, where as \"American Me\" focuses on the paths of the main characters in this movie (like Santana, Puppet, Lil\u0027 Puppet, etc).. but not only does it show their lifestyles, but it also focuses on how its having an effect on their families, and how their families feel about the life that their kids are leading... \"American Me\" i think involves more of the family in this picture and culture (La Raza) then \"Blood In, Blood Out\" does... it also shows its origin, like the Pachuco\u0027s (Zoot Suit\u0027s, Zoot Suit riots).. This movie is pretty close to 5 stars in my book... To me i think it definitely is 1/2 star better then \"Blood In, Blood Out\"...becuase this one seems to have alot more of a story line to it, and more characters its focusing on... both in and outside the prison walls..\n\nIf you\u0027re not sure about owning it, rent it first... but i can pretty much guarantee that you\u0027ll eventually end up owning it\n",
    "\nAn intriging suspense film with a shocking ending.  The clues are obvious throughout the film, but the viewer is, nevertheless, surprised and possibily amazed.  Alan Rickman shines as David Weinburg, the social climbing husband. His performance shows his versality as an actor. For viewers who like suspense Dark Harbor is a must\n",
    "\n This excellent DVD gives us a remarkable version of Martin Scorsese\u0027s film. It has been color corrected by Scorsese himself, and remastered for superior sound quality.\nThe concert on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 was the final concert of The Band, with its original lineup. Numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion. The Band were clearly at the top of their game that night, despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them. Classic songs like \"Up on Cripple Creek\", \"Stage Fright\",and \"They Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" are given excellent rendtions. The guest stars seem to be having a good time, with backing by The Band themselves. Ronnie Hawkins does an outstanding \"Who Do You Love\". Dr. John does his classic \"Such A Night\". Joni Mitchell performs her underrated \"Coyote\". A high-kickin\u0027 Van Morrison rocks the house with \"Caravan\". And blues legend Muddy Waters does a spectacular \"Mannish Boy\". In a \"making of\" featurette, Scorsese says Waters\u0027 perforance of this song was almost not filmed, because most of the cameras ran out of film. Fortunately, one cameraman caught the whole song, so we can have this excellent performance.\n Neil Young, Eric Clapton,and Bob Dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup. Scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of The Band.\n The DVD also incudes two commentaries. One features Scorsese and Robbie Robertson, the other features Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, and guests stars Hawkins and Mavis Staples. They all have good stories to tell, and serve to enhance the film quite well. A previously unseen jam, and an eight page booklet written by Robertson round out the DVD. \nI highly reccomend this DVD to this classic film\u0027s many fans\n",
    "\nWelcome to the Lower East Side, where the high-rise apartments of the super-rich abut the tenements on the riverside. Here Joel McCrea, a poor would-be architect, is infatuated with rich girl Wendy Barrie, while poor girl Sylvia Sidney pines for him, all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets. Into the scene strides Humphrey Bogart as a wanted killer, coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame. Intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the Dead End Kids (in what would be the first of many screen appearances), of which Sidney\u0027s brother is the leader.\n\nThe film is based on a play, and boy can you tell. The studio set is deeply obvious as such, and the structure is too carefully symmetrical. The social symbolism is subtle as a sledgehammer, and the script is too caught up with being Worthy. Bogart\u0027s performance is a striking one, however, and his character stands out as fully realized when compared to the walking Social Messages incarnated by Sidney and McCrea. The Dead End Kids (also known as the East Side Kids, the Bowery Boys, and the Little Tough Guys) would show again the following year in Angels with Dirty Faces, and viewing the two films together is instructive, showing, among other things, the difference between MGM\u0027s gloss (which sat uneasily on a gangster story) and Warner\u0027s far more convincing grit.\n\nThe mono track is in good shape. The print is in pretty good shape, but there\u0027s no hiding the fact that this is a film from 1937. The trailer is here, and nothing else. The menu is basic.\n\nOnce celebrated with Oscar nominations, this film now seems rather silly compared to the Warner gangster films of the same period. But it has a definite historical value, and certainly deserves its release\n",
    "\nThis continuation of the Anne series on screen is very well done, and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did.  The only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers.  What it really does is just focus on a few key incidents, and drastically truncates Anne\u0027s college and teaching experiences.  Morgan Harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of Roy Gardner, Sophy Sinclair, Old Mrs. Gibson and Pauline, and Elizabeth.  This installment ends with Anne and Gilbert becoming engaged.  \nI highly recommend it - just don\u0027t expect the same level of detail as \"Anne of Green Gables\" provided\n",
    "\nWhat a complilation!  Much better than what availiable out there on him. It was good to see some of the old clips from the Sixties of Marvin.  I know that there\u0027s got to be more. I especially liked the clip with Tammi Terrell.  I was great to see her flirting with him while they were performing.  That\u0027s the stuff of legends.  I hope Motown continues this series of DVD\u0027s with their other acts.\n",
    "\nBrilliant is an often overworked phrase, but in the case of *Hamlet* starring Mel Gibson, the word cannot be used enough.  For brevity\u0027s sake, I will save Zeffirelli\u0027s cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing.  This review is for Chris Devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult Shakespeare script.  Devore somehow makes it better.  Were he in London, late 1500\u0027s, he would have been a collaborator, making Will\u0027s work the pearl it is today.  My only plea is that, at some date, we will get to see Gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared.\n\nThis may have been Glenn Close\u0027s best work.  This is not a complaint, but rather a sign that anyting else she may have or has done cannot be any better than this wonderful, small role.  Ophelia (Close) has an important commentary that must be heard in order for the play to work - Will was no fool - and it needs a Close to do it.\n\nAlan Bates has been a staple of English theatre and screen and has delivered many fine parts (such as Gabriel Oaks in *Far From the Madding Crowd*, 1967).  As Claudius, the regicide and brother of Hamlet, Senior, Bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble except for that one small cancer, that flaw in his character - very clintonian and very believable.\n\nI have wanted to kick Ian Holm\u0027s ever since Ash hurt Ripley in *Alien*, 1979.  I have to keep reminding myself that he really is that believable and that I really don\u0027t hate him, It\u0027s the character he has created so well.  His body of work is repleat with characters of such believability that you forget his name - IAN HOLM - until he does it again, the next time, in the next movie.  If films were strictly Hasidic, Holm\u0027s version of Polonius would be Kosher.  There is not one piece of ham in his entire performance. It is worth the purchase of the DVD just to see him act.\n\nEveryone is good in the movie and there is not time to talk about all of them.  But a note to those whose noses are airbourne and won\u0027t tolerate anyone but Olivier as Hamlet.  There are several uneven performances in his excellent movie.  There are no uneven performances in this piece.\n\nFinally, we come to the mad prince of Denmark.  It is most astonishing that I watched this epic again after Mel\u0027s dark night of the troll, thrashing about in complete insanity, arguably brought on by hard likker, frustration, and stupidity.  Yet with all said, Gibson IS the essential Hamlet.  You will find no other actor who delivers the goods the way the Cruiser from the Boozer does.\n\nYou know this is true, not just by watching the exquisite performance on the DVD, but by Gibson\u0027s own marvelling at what was accomplished, not because of some actor\u0027s raison d\u0027etre, but rather by the actor\u0027s very ability to understand that he is dealing with things that go beyond the ken of normal humans.  IS Hamlet crazy, or crazy like a fox?  And when is he crazy we get to hear Mel say in the devastating interview he made for the DVD release many years gone by.\n\nSo, enough from me.\n\nIf you want to see the best Hamlet ever, buy this DVD and feast.\n\n- Dick Anderso\n",
    "\nHarvey Milk was the elected supervisor of District 6 in San Francisco when he was murdered--along with Mayor George Moscone on November 27, 1978, by fellow supervisor, Dan White (who later claimed the infamous \"Twinkie defense\"). The film \"The Times of Harvey Milk\" firmly places the murder of Milk, a gay politician, into the politically significant context of the times. The crime, the verdict, and the sentence served were all shocking. This film tells the story behind the headlines. \n\nMilk was a stockbroker on the East Coast, when he decided to pull up roots and head for San Francisco. He opened a camera shop on Castro Street and quickly earned the name of \"Mayor of Castro Street\" for his enthusiastic community involvement. His interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office, but when the city\u0027s elections ran by district--rather than citywide--Milk became the newly elected supervisor for the Sixth District. Milk\u0027s enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall. \n\nThe film includes photographs, newsreel footage, and many interviews with those who crossed Milk\u0027s path in a professional or personal capacity. Milk was passionate about public transportation, rent control, and the rights of seniors and gays. White, on the other hand, found San Francisco\u0027s Gay Day \"obscene.\" Eerily, there are several photos of Milk that also include his killer--clean cut, ex-fireman and family man, Supervisor Dan White. The film explores the flavour of the times--San Francisco was becoming a gay Mecca, and there were some people who couldn\u0027t adjust to that fact. Senator John Briggs, who called San Francisco \"the moral garbage dump of the nation\" was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired. Milk fought this ballot tooth and nail, and it failed. \n\nThe film \"The Times of Harvey Milk\" includes two discs. One disc contains the film, and the other disc is packed with extra features--including coverage of the film\u0027s premiere in Castro Street, a Dan White update, 1st and 25th anniversary events of the crime, director\u0027s commentary, the Academy Awards 1985, and a photo gallery. For those of us who remember the headlines, \"The Times of Harvey Milk\" is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time--displacedhuma\n",
    "\nThe Danny Boyle directed \"Trainspotting\" was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of Scottish heroin addicted losers.  While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted.  Ewan McGregor playing Mark Renton and his crew which included \"Full Monty\" star Robert Carlyle, as violent psycho Begbie, swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high.\n\nCongregating in a filthy, deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high.  As a group they\u0027re abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix.\n\nMcGregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies.  Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories.  In a humorous scene, cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories.  He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them.\n\nMcGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations, escaping to London and working as a realtor.  His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life.\n\nMcGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,........the big drug deal.  They manage to complete the deal for 16,000 pounds which McGregor decides to steal.  He intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew.  Fat chance\n",

Everything in this movie deserves 5 stars\n",
    "\nThis DVD is explaining things better than the previous version, where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc. \n\nSome of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained.

There after one has to go into religion and spirituality - particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the \"Sanathana Dharma\" teachings\n",
    "\nI cannot recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie, which is my favourite from the 1980\u0027s by far. The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in \"Big Business\",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood\u0027s Golden Age. A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn\u0027t seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory. The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in \"Big Business\", it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York\u0027s business world.\n\nThe story begins in a flash back when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton are passing through rural backwater Jupitor Hollow when Binky goes into labour. At the same time locals Garth and Iona Ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of Sadie and Rose but are also mixed up. We move forward forty years to where Sadie Shelton is the corporate head of Moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of Holomade, the local industry in Jupitor Hollow. Getting wind of their plans the militant Jupitor Hollow resident Rose Ratliff decides to go fight these \"Pinstriped Trouser Snakes\", on their own territory and Sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring Jupitor Hollow. Through a mix up they end up staying in the Plaza Hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as \"sinks in the living room\", and \"soaps in the shapes of swans\"! Complication piles on top of complication as Sadie Shelton\u0027s ex husband Michael (Barry Primus), can\u0027t believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural Sadie for his hard nosed wife and Jay Marshall(Michael Gross), can\u0027t for the life of him understand why Rose (Ratliff) is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure Rose (Shelton). All comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two Sadie\u0027s are really the city Sheltons while the two Rose\u0027s are really the twins meant to be in Jupitor Hollow. The fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when Sadie (Shelton), is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to Sadie (Ratliff), to put all her watching of her idol Alexis Carrington in \"Dynasty\", to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing Jupitor Hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully. \n\nClassic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins, on the classic 1960\u0027s comedy series \"The Patty Duke Show\". I dont think I\u0027ve ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in \"Big Business\". Her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails Sadie Shelton who\u0027s all \"hostile takeovers\" to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin Sadie Ratliff who only wants to be able to say \"keep the change!\" is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter. Her classic mirror sequence with her \"twin\", is a total riot and her statement that \"this whole thing has got UFO written all over it!\",will have you breaking up with laughter. Equally Lily Tomlin as both country activist Rose Ratcliff, \"I\u0027m gonna go kick some snooty New York Ass!\", and as Rose Shelton the awkward out of place city girl \"I hate shopping and I hate New York in June!\",is also top rate. Her rejection of Jay\u0027s engagement ring as a supposed \"bribe\" and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a \"great big belly scraping pile of cow plop!\", is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene I never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening I have of this movie. Of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at New York\u0027s Plaza Hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up. Two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk\u0027s (Joe Grifasi), continual mixing up of Sadie Shelton/Ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined, and especially Fabio Alberici\u0027s (Michele Placido), total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers, the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone! The hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women (one from the country and the other from the city), seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff. It is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first. Classics like: \"Im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease!\",\"Oh my God it\u0027s so COSMOpolitan\", \"Oh sure its full of crowds, smog, sex fiends, and white slavers, it\u0027s a pistol, I\u0027ve got about as much use for it (New York), as a Toad has for spit pearls!\", \"Computer chips, they\u0027ve got their ways!\", and \"Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase?\", are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script. \n\nTotal escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more. It is a real pity that \"Big Business\", so far has marked the only time that Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle. This film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages. I\u0027ve been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as I am! So I\u0027d say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven\u0027t already. You wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends, in Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in \"Big Business\". Enjoy!   \n",
    "\nWarning! This is not for children. Seeing death, real destruction, and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on 9/11 is not for the young. \n\nWith that being said, this is the real deal, what you probably didn\u0027t see on the nightly news. Great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of New York City that fateful day.\n\nIf you never want to forget what happened The Day that Changed America, you must have this dvd.\n",
    "\nThis documentary gives a brief introduction to Al-Jazeera, which, if you didn\u0027t know already, is the main arab language newschannel. It is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it\u0027s willingness to go where other, stated-owned and controlled arab networks won\u0027t tread. In this sense it is more than a mere arab CNN in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media.\n\nThe filmmakers here interview Al-Jazeera personel, as well as some american journalists, and the american official which liases with Al-Jazeera for Centcom, the american Central Command in the present Irak war (which happens to be 30 miles from Al Jazeera headquarters). It covers the timeline from just before the war, to just after Bush anounced main millitary operations to be over. \n\nBy striving to be neutral, the documentary allows you to see how Al-Jazeera see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world. They are very disappointed in the United States, but adhere strongly to its values. \n\nAlso interesting is how being \"on the arab side\" gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values, like when they are angered by Pentagon protests at their having showed images of US prisoners, when western media routinely show Iraki POWs.\n\nAn unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be. The american liaison doesn\u0027t speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source, and as if that weren\u0027t enough, he is barely articulate in english and clearly doesn\u0027t know anything about the local context and history. Another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials, but doesn\u0027t have the foresight to have some to give to journalists, irritating the very people they are trying to win over.\n\nAll in all it\u0027s a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds. It gets four stars rather than five because of it\u0027s sometimes amateurish handling of flow, which makes it at times a bit unfocused\n",

    "\nI woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of Fellini Satyricon.  Someone is mortally wounded, the blonde guy?  And lies there dying, watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired, Gitone, and some dancing leaping black guy....  I think.  \n   I\u0027ve seen it probably 9 times, it always was a favorite when I was a teen and older, but I haven\u0027t seen it for years.  But it was so visually entrancing, and so truly pre-Christian -- that is, made from that standpoint, which movies seldom are or can be!  \n    I just remember the wonderul images, a boat rising in the mist, the strange tenement bldg they (Ascylto and Encolpio) live in, the sea monster, the bacchanale, the hermaphrodite\u0027s cavern, the Minotaur.....  endless, splendid, dreamlike images on and on....\n  [I wonder why it is Italians are such master of the visual in this manner; I think of Visconti, Antonioni, even Scorsese and the American-Italians -- maybe it\u0027s that Renaissance artist legacy?]\n\nFrom my buddy:  Like you, I saw it a few times, decades ago.  The images are so strong and mysterious. Images that render volumes of emotions that are so deep, echoing a memory that is never realized. Modern day, Scorsese manages it. Zefferelli too.\nThat is true film-making. Even the older films from De Sica capture images that are unforgettable. Wells has done it.\nBut what you\u0027re talking about, is, I suppose, secular in nature. Icons derived from the human experience that has meaning from within the human soul. Not from an outward omnipresence of theology.  Satyricon is almost existential, as a presentation of true human nature. Done with frame-paintings. And framed in such a way that is evocative.  Amazing dream art!\n",

    "\nMore than \"male\" and \"female\". More than your view or her view or my view or any one person\u0027s view of what makes \"male\" and what makes \"female\" and everything in between. Sexuality (gay, straight, bi, asexual, etc) is different than gender (male/female) and can have nothing and yet sometimes everything to do with the other.\n\nThere are gay men and straight me and bisexual men, too. Whatever they identify as has no impact on whether they are also transsexual and seek re-assignment into a body that fits them more. It\u0027s not some sick fetish or crazy delusion. Surgery, hormones, these are RISKY! And they would not be undertaken unless other options HAD been explored and found unable to cease the ache inside.\n\nGender Identity Disorder (GID) is real. Transition (the process of taking hormones, living as the preferred gender in all things, surgery, etc) is not a CURE but it can make life bearable.\n\nAnd I think it\u0027s funny that still male to female transsexuals are regarded more often as \"real\" and the female to male transsexuals are ignored. \n\nRaci has known she was trans it appears most of her life. She started taking hormones while she was still in what should have been her male puberty. So, of COURSE she looks \"more feminine\" but that doesn\u0027t make her any more or less of a \"real woman\" than the other MTF, Gabbie. Gabbie is a lesbian while Raci is straight. See how this works? Gabbie likes women, Raci likes men. It has nothing to do with one being \"right\" and one being \"wrong\".\n\nThere is a world of difference between a man relating to a woman and a woman relating to a woman. Just as a man relating to a man vs. a man relating to a woman. And it\u0027s not all sexual. It is entirely plausible that a man would transition into a woman and still be attracted to women. Hello, the gender changed, not who they were attracted to! \n\nI\u0027m just so tired of seeing so many people picking apart transsexuals. We are not here for your amusement. We are not here to be some star in your porn show. We are real. And these kids do an amazing job showing that. But I see that the majority of reviewers are more wound up over the \"sick fetishes\" and one MTF being more female convincing than the other. \n\nI would love to see the same folks who brought us this (a more emotional struggle) to also do one documenting the physical changes that happen and how FTMs, in particular, struggle with the emotional effects of T.\n\n- Wil\n",
    "\nI am not sure why the first person would direct people to read J. Michael Bailey\u0027s work... or why the second person would say that it is as if J. Michael Bailey wrote this himself...one he couldn\u0027t have because it is a documentary, and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary.  Considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community. And he was forced to resign from Northwestern University as the department head, because of his illegal uses of his patient\u0027s information in his book. \n\n\"They seem like different species, because they are.\"\n       I am not sure if I would say that the kids in this documentary are another species... or even that I am another species. They are humans as well and to reduce them to another species is simply rediculous. \n\n   I am not sure why everyone is referencing him, because his view on Transgender people is extremely negative.\n\n... but to the documentary. I think that it gives a great overall view of the trans community, showing that we can stem from all different backrounds, and we can act in all different ways. Just as there are many different \"normal\" gendered people, there are many different trans people as well.  I believe that  ScubaOtter \"seaotter7\"  has the best overview of it.\n",
    "\nI have found Pick Your Spot Pilates to be absolutely perfect!  I can choose which spot I want to work-out for the day or do them all.  I usually walk first then add a 10 minute Pilate workout to wrap it up while my muscles are still warm.  I would highly recommend this workout video\n",
    "\nAn excellent comedy, Kindergarten Cop, brings to the screen the story of a detective that goes undercover to find a key witness and track down a dangerous criminal.  What complicates things is that it\u0027s Arnold Schwarzenegger and he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher...\nThe film combines comedy with action and adventure though it is primarily a comedy and a great one at that!\nArnold Schwarzenegger, (!) and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  \nThe setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!\nIn short, Kindergarten Cop is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven\u0027t done so already)!\n",

    "\nMy 3 year old son loved this movie.  He sat in front of the tv with his model blue angel and mimicked every move the planes made in the video.  It was fun to watch my son and husband watch this video together, they both had big smiles on their faces.  The pilots in this video send a wonderful message to young children with dreams.  My 3 year old says \"when I get big I am going to fly blue angel #5\".  I highly reccomend this video\n",
    "\nSince I\u0027ve already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items, I\u0027m not gonna repeat anything about each show (see individual reviews for that).  I will just rehash what I have all along.  Despite its missing pieces from the book, the Original is still 5 star material.  The \"in betweener\" is only worth it\u0027s value because it is a disc copy (as opposed to a tape copy).  My advice, buy the Original separately, and read the book to get the \"real missing years\".  If you are building a library of \"ALL Richard Chamberlain\", then buy both or this combo.  But be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged \"Missing Years\" has to offer (again see separate review)\n",
    "\nI found this series to be fun, gritty, and lifelike.  The characters in the Precinct remind me so much of guys I used to work with on the job.  Certainly some artistic license is taken, but for the most part, this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs.  Denis Leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian, but a really talented character actor.  His supporting cast fits well, and all in all I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of Rescue Me, or Denis Leary\n",
    "\nA great behind-the-scenes look at decisions that shaped history - and nearly killed all of us.\nCross-reference this with the more recent Kennedy biographies for a wider, sobering context.\nThis is the sort of thing that the Bush Administration should have watched before deciding to invade Iraq. \n",
    "\nThis is probably one of the funniest movies I\u0027ve ever seen.  Those who don\u0027t think it\u0027s funny are those who are easily offended.  If you are easily offended or politically correct you probably won\u0027t enjoy this film.\n\nHaving said that, if you like vampires you won\u0027t necessarily dislike this film.  I completely disagree with the reviewer who said \"If you like vampires, you will not like this movie.\" That\u0027s crap.  I love vampires/vampire movies and I loved this movie.  Believe it or not, not all vampire fans are two-dimensional, some of us are actually well rounded.\n\nThe person who compared it to Polanski\u0027s \"Repulsion\" needs to get away from the bong.  While both deal with mental insanity, the same can be said about a lot of films.  \"Repulsion\" was just disturbing and weird, and not overly entertaining.  (Polanski\u0027s work is highly overrated and pretentious.  We watch films to be entertained, not to have whatever it is Polanski tries to pull.)\n\nHaving said all this, this is definitely not a film for everyone.  It was way ahead of it\u0027s time when it was made.  Had it been made now, there would likely be a huge cult following behind it...but then again, maybe not.  As liberal as most like to imagine themselves, we still live in a country of highly uptight people, easily offended, and unable to laugh at the things we fear or find disturbing.\n\nIf you\u0027ve got a sick sense of humor, add this to your video library, because if you aren\u0027t going to be able to laugh at it, you aren\u0027t going to enjoy it. \n",
    "\nLoved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around.  Two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries.  Very funny and moving - yes, I\u0027m a romantic! It\u0027s awesome!\n",
    "\nOne of the many hit TV shows inextricably linked to the 1980\u0027s is The A-Team, an action series with plenty of bombs, machine guns, and bazookas - where miraculously no one ever seems to die! Short for \"Alpha Team,\" The A-Team is a Vietnam-era crack commando unit wrongfully accused of robbing the Bank of Hanoi. Having escaped from a maximum security prison, the four man team survives in the anonymity of the Los Angeles underground. And with the government still hot on their trail, they\u0027re forced to work as soldiers of fortune, providing aid and assistance to the helpless victims of various injustices... \n\nThe A-Team is led by cigar aficionado Col. John \"Hannibal\" Smith (George Peppard), a wise-cracking officer who always has a plan in the works. Hannibal is flanked by Lt. Templeton \"Faceman\" Peck (Dirk Benedict), the consummate ladies\u0027 man; Sgt. Bosco \"B.A.\" Baracus (Mr. T), a gold-drenched muscleman afraid of flying; and Captain H.M \"Howling Mad\" Murdock, a lanky mental case who nevertheless carries out his missions with flawless precision. Together, they travel the country in B.A.\u0027s trademark black van, fighting for justice and attempting to elude the clutches of the nefarious Colonel Decker (Lance LeGault) who wants nothing more in life than to capture The A-Team... \n\nThe A-Team (Season 1) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere \"Mexican Slayride\" in which journalist Amy Allen sets out to prove the existence of The A-Team and its various good deeds. But when a fellow reporter is kidnapped by Mexican renegades, Amy gets a firsthand look at The A-Team\u0027s handiwork when she hires them to rescue her friend... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include \"Holiday in the Hills\" in which, following a plane crash, The A-Team is forced to do battle with a group of mountain men, and \"One More Time\" in which the U.S. government itself hires The A-Team to rescue a general and his daughter from South American guerillas...\n\nBelow is a list of episodes included on The A-Team (Season 1) DVD:\n\nEpisode 1 (Mexican Slayride: Part 1) \nEpisode 2 (Mexican Slayride: Part 2) \nEpisode 3 (Children of Jamestown) \nEpisode 4 (Pros and Cons) \nEpisode 5 (A Small and Deadly War) \nEpisode 6 (Black Day at Bad Rock) \nEpisode 7 (The Rabbit Who Ate Las Vegas) \nEpisode 8 (The Out-of-Towners) \nEpisode 9 (Holiday in the Hills) \nEpisode 10 (West Coast Turnaround) \nEpisode 11 (One More Time) \nEpisode 12 (Till Death Do Us Part) \nEpisode 13 (The Beast from the Belly of a Boeing) \nEpisode 14 (A Nice Place to Visit) \n\nThe DVD Repor\n",
    "\nIt is nice to see Bebe Neuwirth in something other than Cheers.\n\nOscar (Aaron Stanford) is too sophisticated for girls his age but not for his stepmother (Sigourney Weaver) and Bebe Neuwirth (the seductress). Women are all over him. His stepmom ignores him and chiropractor thinks she finds the romantic she\u0027s always dreamed of. The joking innuendos are quite hilarious reminding me of the Graduate. Gary Winnick (the director) shot this movie on a digital camera in two weeks and won raves at the festivals.\n\nThe little captions before or after a scene kinda tell you how Oscar is working or getting worked over. John Ritter (Dad, apparently serious but funny) and the whole cast gives strong performances certainly earning their street creed.\n\nYou\u0027ll find charming nuggets of truth in this movie, quite a bit of wit, and hilarity. Sure, Oscar is 15 and, rather than opening his eyes to girls, they open his. His daydreams about his stepmom are electrifyingly filmed.\n\nAs for the morality, I think people are a little paranoid over this taut, striking film. If you are openminded, you\u0027ll find this film is more about coming of age than what narrow minded people think. It is a light film to the touch and men will probably be reliving high school fantasies about the older woman. Women will like it because it shows how men are nothing more than putty in their hands. It is just amazing how much depth this film has in 77 minutes!\n\nRachel Alice Hunter\nChairwoman\nTeardropfilms Entertainment Corporatio\n",
    "\nFrom the Sisyphean (say what?) misadventures of a kind of black Laurel and Hardy duo (Anthony Anderson and Lahmard J. Tate) who steal an ATM machine with no money in it that they can\u0027t open, to the white dude who thinks he\u0027s black, to Cedric the Entertainer who thinks that Rosa Parks got too much credit for parking her butt on the bus, to sexy and saucy Eve who always loves the wrong guy, this is one fine piece of entertainment.  And Ice Cube as Calvin who owns the shop ain\u0027t so bad himself, although he sure has to frown a lot.\n\nWell, he\u0027s got troubles right here in the Windy City.  He\u0027s always got an entrepreneurial scheme up his sleeve that just doesn\u0027t quite work out which causes him to fall behind in his property taxes.  Now this might not be such a big deal but the barbershop has been in his family for three generations and it serves as a kind of neighborhood club where people can hang out and shoot the breeze.  It\u0027s a beloved kind of place.  Enter Lester Wallace the loan shark with muscle who makes Calvin an offer he can\u0027t refuse.  Well, he does refuse it or at least he tries, but Wallace ain\u0027t the kind of dude to take a refusal.\n\nCan Calvin save the barbershop?  That\u0027s the question of the main plot line, but what really makes this movie such a treat are the barbershop mini-stories that are neatly tied together and the fine repartee.  And what makes THAT work is that everything in the film is seen from a point of view inside the black community and not from somebody else looking in (which never works, but is often tried).\t\t\t\t\t\nAdd a warm and redemptive ending, and there ain\u0027t nobody cryin\u0027.\n\nBut see this for Tim Story who directed and got it all right, and for Mark Brown, Don D.

The film sensitively portrays a young Indian girl\u0027s difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being.  The film is enjoyable on several levels: 1) there is the cultural clash between Britons of various descent, 2) there is the hilarious \"lesbian\" mixup, and 3) the pure sports film.  All in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people\n",

    "\nIf playwright Tennessee Williams\u0027s Southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of O\u0027Neill or his closest contemporary Arthur Miller, they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters. This is clearly evidenced in this six-film, eight-disc collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of Hollywood in the 1950\u0027s and early 1960\u0027s, all directed by true filmmaking masters. Probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now, the best of the set are Elia Kazan\u0027s \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and John Huston\u0027s \"The Night of the Iguana\". The others are Kazan\u0027s \"Baby Doll\", Richard Brooks\u0027 \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", Jose Quintero\u0027s \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" and Brooks\u0027 \"Sweet Bird of Youth\". \n\nA feral, smoldering Marlon Brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish Stanley Kowalski in 1951\u0027s \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen. Intriguingly, one of the extras included in the two-disc set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of Brando when he was 23, and his stardom seems assured even then. The plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between Kowalski and his visiting sister-in-law, Blanche DuBois, a fading Southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown. Having proven her ability to be a convincing Southerner in \"Gone With the Wind\", Vivien Leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability.\n\nStrong supporting work comes from Kim Hunter as Blanche\u0027s naive sister Stella and Karl Malden as Blanche\u0027s seemingly respectful suitor Mitch. Now over ninety, Malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track, and film historians Rudy Behlmer and Jeff Young provide more objective commentary on another track. Film critic Richard Schickel\u0027s 1995 feature-length look at Kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk, and there is also a more interesting five-part documentary on the film and original Broadway show, the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the DVD version of the film.\n\n1964\u0027s \"The Night of the Iguana\" deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people, but this time the setting is a dilapidated Mexican beach resort where Reverend Shannon, newly defrocked, has taken a group of spinsters from a women\u0027s college. Huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations, and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations, striking visuals and dark humor. Richard Burton is in peak form as Shannon, and there is also sterling work from Deborah Kerr as the spinsterish Hannah and especially Ava Gardner as the slatternly resort owner, Maxine Faulk. The DVD contains a recent making-of featurette and a vintage video, both fascinating.\n\n\"Baby Doll\" is an entertaining hoot that doesn\u0027t seem as sensationalistic as I\u0027m sure it was when the film was first released in 1956. It\u0027s simply a Southern-fried farce about the potential deflowering of a nineteen-year old child bride with a nice, pouty turn by Carroll Baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by Karl Malden as her randy husband, cotton mill owner Archie. 1958\u0027s \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of Brick as an asexual protagonist, this in spite of stellar performances from Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives.\n\nNewman is even better as gigolo Chance Wayne in 1963\u0027s \"Sweet Bird of Youth\", and he is matched all the way by Geraldine Page\u0027s all-cylinders-on performance as faded movie queen Alexandra Del Lago (a role that would have ironically been ideal for Ava Gardner). The weakest film of the set is 1961\u0027s \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" about an aging American actress living in Rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo. A decade after \"Streetcar\", the glamorous-looking Leigh excels in the title role, while a young Warren Beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo Paolo even though his faux-Italian accent is a little too emphatic. All four of these movies come with making-of featurettes and original trailers, and \"Cat\" also includes commentary from Williams\u0027 biographer Donald Spoto.\n\nThe focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary, \"Tennessee Williams\u0027 South\", which highlights insightful interviews with Williams in the New Orleans area. The film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary. You can have the privilege of seeing Broadway\u0027s original Blanche DuBois, Jessica Tandy, and compare her work to Leigh\u0027s, as well as an impressive turn by Maureen Stapleton as Amanda Wingfield in \"The Glass Menagerie\". This is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of mid-20th century American cinema\n",
    "\nWhen I first watched this TV movie, with an unusal turn by Lucille Ball as a homeless woman, I was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role, and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished \"bag lady\".

I love this movie. I\u0027m a huge musical fan and I\u0027ve been waiting years for this one. They must have finally convinced whomever had the rights to release it on DVD.

This second set is full of hits and it\u0027s definitely worth watching.  (You could purchase Tommy and Quadrophenia individually, but you\u0027d miss out on this hits disc.)\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve heard it said that if you haven\u0027t read the book you\u0027d be lost in this movie. I read the book and it was still a bit confusing! I like this version of the film with all the extra footage. Such a fantastic looking picture this was. I saw this in the theater when it came out. I remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing. Sting was touted as starring in this film, when in reality he had a supporting role. Shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band, The Police. It was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater. Having said that, Sting is actually pretty good in this film. He sneers, he wise cracks, he fights, and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo. Of course, he gets killed in the end. Oh well\n",
    "\nThis is one of the best sci fi films from the 70\u0027s--not to be missed\n",
    "\nAlthough I enjoy Pilates and yoga, I need a good workout that makes me sweat.  Boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose.  But there are times where I prefer to feel the burn at home.  To that end, one of the best cardio/strength DVD workouts I\u0027ve found is \"Crunch: Boot Camp Training.\"  \n\nThe workout runs for about 30 minutes, which is great for those days where I want a shorter (but still effective) one.  It\u0027s short because exercises are combined together in order to minimize time and maximize benefit.  For example, three-to-ten pound hand weights are used to work the upper body while doing squats and lunges.  Abs and obliques are worked on the floor with different types of crunches, and during standing cardio work by side knee lifts.  Of course, a boot camp workout would be incomplete without pushups - there are three sets, each with a different emphasis to shake things up (and the lower body is worked in as well).  A cooldown/stretch session concludes the proceedings.\n\nAs for the instructor, Susan Hitzmann is one of the best I\u0027ve seen on a DVD workout.  She has an infectious enthusiasm that challenges and encourages at the same time.  She calls well, using a clear and authoritative voice.  I also enjoyed the chemistry between her and the rest of the class.  This is one of the few DVD workouts where I can identify with the assistants, because they look like they are actually working out.  They moan, groan, and laugh like real people, and plastic smiles are kept to a minimum.  Finally, the generic accompanying music complements the workout without overwhelming it.\n\nThere are two caveats for \"Crunch: Boot Camp Training.\"  First, it might be hard on someone with sensitive knees because there are a lot of squats and forward lunges.  I had an ACL recon years ago, so I usually do backward lunges in place of the forward ones (the workout also features backward lunges).  Also, the routine\u0027s fast pace and combinations may confuse or wear out beginners.  But easier variations are demonstrated by a woman on the instructor\u0027s left side, so this is a workout you can grow into.  Even so, if your body takes time to get limber due to age or previous injury, you may want to warm up on your own beforehand.  \n\n\"Crunch: Boot Camp Training\" is an excellent boot camp-style home workout.  I own a large number of exercise DVDs, and this one\u0027s on my go-to stack.  Highly recommended\n",
    "\nWell I thought it was going to stop at Volume 1.  But, I guess it didn\u0027t.\nBut, I am amazed that some of the cast is still living.  I can\u0027t believe that Skip Hinnant who plays Fargo North Decoder has got gray hair and still seems to be in good health.  Not to mention Jim Boyd who plays J. Arthur Crank is also still alive but on the heavy side.  As for Judy Graubart, I can\u0027t believe how old and skin and bones she is.  She must\u0027ve been the oldest actor on the cast because now you should see her today.  Hattie Winston poor thing, I think she must\u0027ve suffered a stroke or something cause I\u0027ve noticed in her interviews she twitches every now and then.  We hardly ever see Morgan Freeman in any of these interviews because he\u0027s a big time busy actor.  But, I loved the show and am glad they brought this collection together in another set of DVD\u0027s from a show I grew up watching when I was 10.  Luis Avalos who I loved watching not just on the Electric Company but in his acting career in movies like Stir Crazy and then a full role in Dom DeLuise\u0027s HOT STUFF along with his family.  Luis still looks the same but has gained some weight too like Jim Boyd.  It is great that the graphics and color of the sets on each show brings back memories and the songs they sang too brought back some memories.  It is also hard to believe that the voices you hear on the cartoon skits like Letterman are Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Joan Rivers, and Mel Brooks.  You wouldn\u0027t have thought that there voice talents would be a credit to their success today.  Well now we have to get ready for Volume 3.....will there be? ......Let\u0027s hope so, cause I will surely buy it!\n\n",
    "\nWe recently purchased this DVD for our three year old son who is obsessed with John Deere tractors.  He watches it over and over again until we can\u0027t take it anymore.

    "\nWhat do I think of when someone says \"Disney!\"? Hmmm...kiddy films, girly stuff, princess(groan, we don\u0027t need more of that!), dreams come true and...cheesy?\nYep, all of the things above are in Ice Princess, with some fresh twists. With the \"mean rival\" changed to \"nice rival\", and add \"with hard work\" after \"dreams come true\". I mean, look at Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what did they do to make their dreams come true, which is a pathetic one, to marry a prince? One had a 100-year beauty sleep and the other had a fairy-godmother to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand! Casey Carlyle was totally different. I agree with people, that it\u0027s impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I give this film a 4 and not a 5. But it\u0027s an improvement.\nThe cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done, and while people on IMDB say that they\u0027re to showy, it is true, but aww, come on, this is a movie, not a real competition, and everybody likes some nice ice-skating in movies.\nThe acting is great, especially Michelle Trachtenberg and Hayden Panettiere. Michelle\u0027s acting is really good, and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements. Hayden Panettiere\u0027s acting is also good, but it\u0027s a pity that her character is somewhat bland and \"Mary-Sue\"ish. \"Mary-Sue\"ish would mean that she\u0027s almost perfect. She\u0027s smart, good at sports and extremely popular also. It is very unfair, because on the page I\u0027m writing this review on, it says \"Ice Princess (Widescreen Edition)~JOAN CUSACK. I know she and Kim Catrall or the ones with fame, and don\u0027t mistake me, the acting IS good, but Casey and Gen completely steals the stage, and in the place of Joan Cusack, it should be the names of those two.\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, especially Reachin\u0027 for Heaven and No One. Delicious songs! And Reachin\u0027 for Heaven is currently competing with forty something other songs for a place in the 78th Oscar Nominations List. Good luck\n",
    "\nAs usual with a Bruce Willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was. Interesting high-tech house and mostly believable small-town villains who are the hostage-takers. The underlying story of the rich dad \u0026 his swindles detracted from it I think\n",
    "\nTo have these three classics for this low price is fantastic. One film is the 1938 version of the classic Christmas Carol this one starring Reginald Owen as a very respectable Scrooge. If you can refrain from comparing him to Alastair Sim, you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of Scrooge, and it is a fine one. Owen is truly miserly and wretched, as befits Scrooge, and very believable. The overall production is wonderful, the only drawback was the casting of Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim...WAY over the top, to the point where he is annoying. But all in all, a great version, and Ann Rutherford as the Ghost of Christmas Past is fascinating.\nChristmas in Connecticut is very satisfying; a real new England Christmas, with Barbara Stanwyck in one of her lighter roles. This is enjoyable for those who are alone over the Holidays and a great film to watch with family for those who will have a traditional Holiday, with family and friends.\nI saved the best for last...Boys Town.\nThis is absolutely one of my all-time favorites, with Mickey Rooney in one of his definitve, cocky wise-guy roles. No one could touch a Mickey Rooney performance in this type of role; he cornered the brash market...as he proves in this movie. It is a real treat to watch him interact with Spencer Tracy, THE finest actor Hollywood has ever produced, IMO. He has dignity, he commands respect simply by virtue of his own quiet, firm presence.\nThe other boys were great complements to the production; all very natural, and Bobs Watson particularly heart-breaking in his role; what a great actor he was! (If you can find a copy, see him with Cedric Hardwicke and Lionel Barrymore in \"On Borrowed Time\", a REAL tear-jerker.)\nI wish I could have been on the set of this one! They must have had a ball. When I saw it, as a child, I thought it was a movie, therefore fantasy, and not real; when I found out that Father Flanagan was indeed real, as was Boys Town, it gave the movie even more of a dimension and interest. His tenet, \"There is no such thing as a bad boy\", is touching in its simplicity and pure, simple faith. Father Flanagan\u0027s secret for success with even the most recalcitrant youth was this faith and his refusal to accept any boy\u0027s lack of self-esteem or belief in himself; with FF ALL things were possible.\nWhen Spencer Tracy was voted best Actor at the Academy Awards that year, he became the first actor to win the award two years in a row...the first was for his part as Manuel, in \"Captains Courageous.\" Being the gracious, wonderful man he was, he accepted his award with extreme humility, and gave it to Father Flanagan, whom he highlighted in his acceptance speech.\nThis movie has drama, excitement and some very funny moments and shows the amazing versatility of a very young Mickey Rooney. A truly great buy\n",
    "\nI first saw this as a child during an \"afternoon movie\" event at my gradeschool.  Little did I understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting, nor did I appreciate the subtle moral of the film, namely that good guys sometimes do finish first, by the very nature of their untainted goodness.\n\nOh, sure, I rooted for Charlie and his uncle, the poorest of the poor, simply trying to make ends meet.  And who didn\u0027t despise Veruca Salt, the bratty English tart--with a pushover for a father--who acted like the world was her private oyster?\n\nBut having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter, I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is, even in our age of CG film wizardry.  And without having seen the new version, I can\u0027t help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder\u0027s timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon, Willy Wonka.\n\nMore impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward, old-fashioned morality tales with universal appeal.  Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film, including gluttony, vanity, greed, and avarice; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike.\n\nThe lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated, and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film, or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?\n\nI\u0027ll have to check it out.  Meanwhile, see the classic, and be charmed all over again\n",
    "\nOK,there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential 3D set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film. The Plot is pure ham and cheese. A whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for Dracula, Frankenstein,The Werewolf of Paris, and The Mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life.( I told you it was stupid)Before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height.If you can accept a movie on the level of a Police Academy or Earnest goes to Camp then you should not have a problem with this. Only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like Camp Blood this is a masterpiece\n",
    "\nThis is a warm-hearted, sweet story based on the Cinderella fairy tale. Only we have Sam, a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake. Sam carries on a secret email/chat romance with the most popular boy in her high school, but she doesn\u0027t know the identity of her Prince Charming.\n\nJennifer Coolidge was a scream as the Botoxed, cosmetically enhanced, tackily dressed wicked stepmother. She was hilarious in \"Legally Blonde\", but really goes all out for this role. Quite a scene stealer was Madeline Zima as one of the two wicked stepsisters. Hilary Duff is her usual adorable, perky blonde self and is a delight to watch.\n\nOne of the funniest moments for me was at the diner that was redecorated into a pepto-bismol fifties motif by the stepmother. The poor waitresses were all required to wear pink cashmere sweaters, pearls, a poodle skirt with petticoats and roller skates. If that isn\u0027t hard enough, the waitresses had to spin as they served people or picked up orders. I love when funny bits like this are slipped into movies. One can just see Jennifer Coolidge\u0027s wicked stepmother character instructing these poor waitresses on how to twirl as they served customers.\n\nThis is a GREAT family film. Although I don\u0027t have children yet, I enjoy this film as a break from all the intense films aimed at adults. It is light-hearted fluff, but very enjoyable, like a cup of hot chocolate. Included on the DVD is Hallie\u0027s and Hilary\u0027s music video of \"Our Lips Are Sealed\" and a bunch of other special features as well.\n",
    "\nWarning: Do not watch this movie if you are hungry! If you do, within the first 10 minutes, you will pause it, and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either, but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes. I adore this movie, It is a heartwarming, hilarious story about a Widower Retired Master Chef and his Three very different daughters. Ang Lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking. The soundtrack is amazing, the scenery is magnificent and the realness of it all transport you in, so that you can almost smell the food cooking. I would have killed to be on that set to just sample all those dishes!\n",
    "\nBased upon director and writer Oliver Stone\u0027s own experiences in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict.  The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier\u0027s soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.\n\nDespite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone\u0027s best movie to date.  Stone\u0027s direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.  The film contains fine performances: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity, despite the deep metaphysical connotations.  PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nI was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.  I\u0027ve never been in battle myself, but I do know that war is hell.  Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to agree with the film\u0027s negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one\u0027s soul to evil.  Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.  This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well (though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATER RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS)\n",
    "\nThis is  a very enjoyable and funny movie with a heartwarming ending. All Michael J. Fox fans be sure to get this! There are many good supporting characters such as: Bridget Fonda, Woody Harrelson, Barnard Hughes and Julie Warner\n",
    "\nOK, this movied is a favorite. Having said that, I am less than blown away by this new transfer. Still looks a bit dull to me. It\u0027s a fun set though. Getting the box was a no-brainer.

    "\nClueless has been released on DVD before, with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features. In 2005, for its 10th anniversary, Paramount finally released a great, if not cheesily named, DVD edition of this 90\u0027s teen comedy classic, with such quotable lines as \"You\u0027re a virgin who can\u0027t drive\" and \"As if!\"\n\nThe transfer on this DVD is AWESOME. It\u0027s very clean, sharp, and clear. I don\u0027t remember any issues on the past DVD, but if there were any, it seems like they were cleared up for this release.\n\nThe bonus features are likeable fluff, but at least they\u0027re existent. Featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members, such featurettes as \"The Class of \u002795,\" which discusses the cast, and \"Language Arts,\" which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon, allow us to delve, if only just slightly, into the making and the impact of this movie. Also, the trailers from the previous DVD release are included.\n\nChildren of the 90\u0027s definitely need to own this DVD. Clueless is still a major part of America\u0027s pop culture today, and really, who doesn\u0027t love watching a 90\u0027s teen comedy remake of a literary classic like Jane Austen\u0027s Emma\n",
    "\nThis one is a classic not only to the general public but among submarine sailors as well.   It is considered the greatest of all submarine movies and with good reason.   Almost the entire plot is onboard and underway.  The tensions that rise from long periods at sea and personality clashes among a large group of strong-willed and independently-minded men is real.  It is a must have for the second world war movie buff and submarine movie collectors.  The acting is superb and perfectly cast in each role.  The dramatic interaction of the characters will keep this one a classic for ages to come\n",
    "\nWhat can I say? This is a darn good action/adventure flick. There\u0027s suspense, guns/ammo, mummies, creepy crawly insects, tombs, and all that there is that make an action movie excellent.

You will appreciate its fine use of colors.\n\nThat really is all there is to say about this movie. But it\u0027s enough. More than enough.

It\u0027s a really cool DVD.

    "\nIn this set of episodes, the Battle City is down to the wire. My favorite character, Marik(not Yami Marik) is the center of the events. Most of his character is known in this set. It seemed almost if Yugi was only a side-note for a while. Even though I dislike dub, this was still good enough for me. \n\nThe scene when Marik talks to his brother for the last time (or so he thinks at that moment) is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime I\u0027ve seen. If only the voice actor sounded like Marik\u0027s age for once and kept the poignant music. And didn\u0027t use the gold stuff when someone\u0027s mind is snatched.\n\n(And also a shame is that the Ishtars won\u0027t appear for many episodes after this with such a simple exit...\n",
    "\nThis DVD contains the basic techniques of Krav maga system. The techniques include attacks with hands (mostly punches with closed fist, but also hammer punches), elbows, knees and feet. There are some counterattacks and defences also included. At the beginning of the film they talk about angles of attack, target areas and stance \u0026 movement. As a DVD extra, they present focus mitt combinations to utilize in your training (they mention that they will produce an entire film on the subject in the future).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that they don\u0027t teach, or even mention the correct falling technique at all. Also, I think they should have taught also palm strikes, but for some reason they were left out. As palm strike is almost as effective as punch with a closed fist, but much more safe for your own hand, it should be included in everyones\u0027 arsenal. When instructing kicking techniques, they mention casually that you can kick also to the head. I think that they should have warned against that, because in real life, kicking above your own waist is considered risky, and generally not advisable.\n\nThe presentation of techniques varies from fair to excellent, the average being of good quality. In some techniques I learned some nuances I had not grasped in my Krav maga classes. Each technique opens up with a dramatized scene in which the technique is used. After that they present the technique at full speed, and after that in slow motion, and finally in learning stages. For some reason, they have chosen not to use slow motion of a full speed presentation of technique. Rather, the person presenting the technique is moving in slow motion, according to the instructions of off-screen narrator. This makes somewhat amateurish impression of the production.\n\nSpeaking of production, it is fairly OK. The film is shot with only one camera, but for the most part, it is shooting at the right spot. The techniques are presented in a studio against a black screen, but the dramatized scenes are shot in loading docks, restaurants, parking lots and so on. They use two narrators who take turns with narrating the techniques. The other narrator is International Krav maga federation head instructor Eyal Yanilov, and the other is U.S. chief instructor Darren Levine. Yanilov does not speak very good English, so from time to time it is hard to grasp what he is saying. Otherwise the production is good, and it\u0027s easy to understand the techniques.\n\nAs a Krav maga practitioner myself, I like the system. In this film, they have succeeded in presenting the basic techniques very well. There are some shortcomings, though, that reduce one star from the rating of this film. \n\nRun time: 1:2\n",

I bought this because I love the Level 42 video for \"Something About You,\" and I figured this was my one shot to get it on DVD.

Starring a stellar cast of some of Hollywood\u0027s best from the \"Golden Age\" of cinema it\u0027s not only one of the greatest films of that era, but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of America was something to be proud of, not mocked. Yes it\u0027s overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions, however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us.\n\nCan the young and naive Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) survive in the United States capital as a newly appointed Senator?

    "\nI almost gave up on this one forty minutes in.  Don\u0027t you do that.  The ending is superb.\n\nPremise: working class girl gets dumped by her boyfriend and seeks work by housekeeping.\n\nWell, that can lead to something better if you keep house for the right person.\n\nJacques (Jean-Pierre Bacri) who recently got walked out on by his wife, and who, not so incidentally looks sixty--well, fifty-five--(actually he was barely fifty when this was made, but you get the point) gets his ad for a housekeeper answered by Laura (Emilie Dequenne) who is twentysomething--a young twentysomething.\n\nI guess there is not much else to say, and to be honest I decided I would force myself to watch the inevitable.  But the director is Claude Berri who directed two of the best movies I ever saw: Manon of the Spring (1986) and Jean De Florette (1986).\n\nAnd so I stayed with it.  At about the fifty minute mark the movie started to get interesting.  I could feel that old guy/young girl love affair was going to take an unexpected fork in the road.  (As Yogi said, if you come to a fork in the road, take it.  The players have no choice.)  Obviously, old guy/young girl can end only one way: young girl leaves old guy for young guy.  This is biology.  It will be painful.\n\nClaude Berri knows all this, and probably a lot better than I do.  And so guess what?\n\nWell, I won\u0027t tell.  But you will find that the last thirty-some minutes of this sexy romantic comedy delightful, and especially the very, very clever and most satisfying ending.\n\nJust prior to that Laura asks Jacques for his blessing.  He won\u0027t give it, but she is right: he should.

A group of singers got together to honor Cohen by singing his songs: Nick Cave, U2 and Bono, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Anthony et al. Added to their performances are footage from many periods of Mr. Cohen\u0027s life, interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well. We thus have this documentary that will delight Mr. Cohen\u0027s fans.  At 72, Mr. Cohen may have lost a lot of his voice-- he opines that he never could carry a tune-- but he has lost none of his brilliant self-deprecating humor.\n\nThe singers are fantastic; but why wouldn\u0027t they be with such words and lyrics?  Nick Cave sings probably Cohen\u0027s most well-known song \"Suzanne,\" introduced to the U. S. public so many years ago by Judy Collins. One wonders if the group drew straws to see who would get to sing that one. Anthony is great, of course; but the Wainwrights, both Martha (her rendition of \"The Traitor\" will put chills on your spine) and Rufus who sings \"Everybody Knows,\" \"Chelsea Hotel Number 2\" and \"Hallelujah\" are not to be missed. Rufus\u0027 account of meeting Leonard Cohen for the first time when he was feeding a young broken bird shouldn\u0027t surprise anyone who has listened to his lyrics over the years.\n\nThis film is one that those of us who love and revere this man will purchase the day it is released on DVD.  \n",
    "\nI am sure that if you are looking at this then you are a fan of the trinity movies.  The Nobody character is based on Trinity but with much more refined.  Terence Hill\u0027s Nobody has a certain directness and is  a much fuller character.  Henry Fonda\u0027s career in spaghetti westerns often gets overlooked and that is a real shame.  If you compare this to his portrayal of Wyatt Earp then you can see that the love of the western never left him.  This is much more the Fonda that one loves rather than the villian in \"Once upon a Time in The West\" (itself a great film).  I love showing this to people that have never seen it. They usally like it and then I move on the the Trinity films\n",
    "\nThe reason I believe the Ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a VERY personal, unexplainable level.  You see, the main storyline of the Ring is the fact that this video tape has been created, and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual, twisted manner.  It\u0027s up to a reporter woman named Rachel to figure everything out.  She\u0027s the main character of the film, along with her son.\n\nAs I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can\u0027t explain.  First of all, the entire film is very effectively well-done the way everything is dark and damp and, for lack of better words, SCARY!  \n\nThe one thing I remembered after watching the Ring are some of the things that were on that video tape.  The mirror on the wall, and the location of the ladder are two things I could have SWORN I\u0027ve seen somewhere before, like a childhood memory I can\u0027t figure out.  Like I\u0027ve been SOMEWHERE and seen those things before.  Like the video tape used in the storyline actually existed before the film was released in 2003, and I believe I\u0027ve actually SEEN the footage on that video tape many years ago *somewhere* because the sequence with the mirror and the ladder looked *incredibly* familiar.  I can\u0027t explain what it is but this is the main reason I find the movie so delightful. \n",

    "\nGiven that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it\u0027s sort of surprising that it hasn\u0027t received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.  \n\nPaul Thomas Anderson\u0027s directing is as excessive and stylish as you\u0027d expect from a movie centered on the porno industry, with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book--long tracking shots, underwater closeups, montages, movie-within-a-movie views, and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness (Dirk\u0027s vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example).  Naturally, Anderson also loads the movie up with period details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk\u0027s room, the platform shoes, and the obligatory disco sequences.  Its visual flair aside, though, Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable, watch-it-until-you\u0027ve-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc. etc. etc.) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade.  This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it, especially its murderer\u0027s row of a cast--Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay), and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) all figure prominently--and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors.  \n\nThat said, what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like.  The main characters almost entirely have hopes, aspirations, and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession--Jack\u0027s desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dirk\u0027s ridiculous pseudo-Karate and Reed\u0027s equally ridiculous poetry; Buck\u0027s goal of opening his own stereo store; Amber\u0027s attempts to get back in touch with her son, which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars--helping us see them as fleshed-out characters, not just plot devices in the story.  \n\nSince there isn\u0027t really a plot to speak of, the movie is told as a series of episodes, Goodfellas-style, with several extended pieces--the pool party at Jack\u0027s House where Eddie/Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew; the New Year\u0027s Eve party celebrating the start of the \u002780\u0027s; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad\u0027s house--serving to turn the narrative in new directions.  This last set piece--when Dirk, Reed, and Todd head over to Rahad\u0027s house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt--deserves special mention, as it\u0027s easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory.  It starts off almost surreal, with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad (clad only in underwear, a bathrobe and slippers) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80\u0027s songs on a mixtape.  From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser, with the lighting, acting, and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control.  Molina\u0027s over-the-top performance, more than anything else, makes the scene, as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and, later, a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge.  I wouldn\u0027t say Molina turns in the best performance I\u0027ve ever seen in a movie, but it it probably the best performance I\u0027ve seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie.\n\nThe \u002780\u0027s are, of course, the hangover from the joys of the previous decade, as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product, cocaine suddenly becomes addictive, and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one.  Fittingly, as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties, the movie takes a darker turn, becoming grittier, more downcast and a lot more violent, but no less compelling.  All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present, just in a decidedly less sunny form.  Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right, the movie\u0027s pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away.  Well, except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end, but by then I for one didn\u0027t care.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "\nIt is said that suffering develops character. Surely, when photographer Zana Briski went on a photography pilgrimage to the red light district in Sonagchi, Calcutta, in India, she discovered more character, and in smaller shape and size, then she might have imagined. Peering through a lens into the darkest shadows of life - into the world of prostitution - to capture the images the world wishes not to see, not, at least, from this angle of truth, she saw between the life-battered women... their children.  \n\nWhen we think of brothels, however we might think of them, how many think of children? Whether we think of these places and their inhabitants as figures of perversity, embodiments of lust, or the tragic painted clowns of the joke that is humanity, it is probably more true than not that these women are rarely seen as, well, women. They are perhaps at best merely meat, merely body parts, to be used and abused and then tossed aside. What Zana Briski\u0027s photo lens reveals is that these are indeed women, human beings, and, for better or for worse, also mothers, daughters, wives, sisters. We see in this montage of photos and film combined, women who are deformed by the ugliness inside. They are broken, they are stunningly and fiercely angry at the world that has so betrayed them, yet they also have their moments of hope and tenderness.\n\nAll of this, and more, falls upon the heads of their children. Weaving between these women are their little ones, boys and girls who grow up around the perversities of lust and abuse. What might such children be like? This is the sharp focus of Briski\u0027s lens. \n\nPerhaps we need to look at ugliness to see beauty in contrast. The faces and spirits of these children contain both. They have in them the despair of those forgotten and betrayed by the world. Society all around them refuses them a place outside the red light district. They are already banned from normalcy. They have been witness to humans at their worst, and no one outside wishes to bear the weight of such witness. Yet they will not be silenced, and if we do not wish to hear them speak, then Briski has given them cameras to let them capture their worlds, inside and out, and bring these images to us. \n\nWhat these children capture on film is nothing less than breathtaking. They miss nothing. Their intense talent and power of seeing discovered, this film also shows us how Briski works to bring this artistic discovery to the world, meanwhile also fighting to give these children a chance, slim as it is, to a life of normalcy. Key to this is education, yet as she soon learns, no school in Calcutta wishes to enroll children born into brothels. At last and with determined persistence, she does find one, and a portal into life beyond opens for some of the children. Their photos, too, are put on exhibit, available also now in book format. \n\nSome are saved, some are pulled back into the dark. The individual stories of these tiny photographers are stories that must be witnessed, heard and seen, so that they know: everyone matters. Even in the darkest shadows, we refuse to be blind to them any longer\n",

    "\nAny movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie). Then again, it was really upsetting at the film\u0027s climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up. Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here. \n\n\"Sahara\" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy. It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask \"how,\" because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score). Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes. Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas. \n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region. However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson). Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent. Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way. \n\nThese narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner (\"Thoughtcrimes\"). The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the \"Panama,\" which comes relatively early in the film. I want to ask, \"Whatever happened to saving the best for last?\" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in \"Raiders of the Lost Arc,\" so why should that happen here? Granted, \"Sahara\" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than \"National Treasure,\" probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality). \n\nBesides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film. I especially liked Sandecker\u0027s third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film. For me the end result is that \"Sahara\" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety. But if you want more, then look elsewhere\n",
    "\nI did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80\u0027s.  I had seen Winds of War, however, and -- at that time, I loved it.  Now, when I purchased the DVD\u0027s, both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction.  I particularly have trouble with accepting Robert Mitchum as a virile, intelligent, sombre, alert and perceptive, about 50-something Pug Henry.  I wish some filmmaker (Curtis would be great!) would do a REMAKE of this entire project -- making it into a 4 hour feature movie -- tightening up the script entirely (apologies to Mr. Wouk who wrote the teleplay) -- mostly keep in the historical scenes--but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea-- and do away with some of the long, soap opera dialogue scenes.  Keep the Holocaust part intact --these were the MOST powerful Holocaust scenes I\u0027ve EVER seen and I\u0027ve seen most of them; but have someone like Kevin Costner be Pug Henry (or Harrison Ford).  And find a truly young, very vibrant Natalie (an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence), and a gorgeous, rather naive rebel leading man to play Byron (Briney).  We need to feel their chemistry -- otherwise, what transpires (Briney\u0027s desperate attempts to find Natalie and his son) seem over-wrought and contrives.I LOVED Polly Bergen as Rhoda -- it might be hard to find anyone better, I think.  And you\u0027d need a new Hitler -- one who is more like the actor who played him in Winds of War\n",

    "\nThough based on a true incident that took place in 1914, in the midst of a WWI battle among the Scots, the French and the Germans, Christian Carrion\u0027s film \"Joyeux Noel\" nonetheless has a dreamlike, other-worldly quality that says more about the state of our current international affairs than it does about Carrion\u0027s telling of this sad, sentimental tale. \nCan you imagine a contemporary world in which countries at war with each other would stop the warring long enough to drink champagne, slug vodka, play cards and toast Christ\u0027s birth?

They are committed. They are also of course, innocent.\nThe ethereal Diane Kruger plays a classical singer, a Swede and therefore neutral but married to a German soldier who, through some personal machinations as well as a pass from Kaiser Wilhelm finds herself on the battlefield on that special night of 12/24/1914.

It is the moral and emotional center of the film as well as its highpoint.\n\"Joyeux Noel\" is a nice reminder of a gentler time: a time when it was the moral and social imperative to always love your country, to always trust your leaders and to always cleave to your family. Unfortunately that time is long gone.\n",
    "\nThe documentary, \"Guerrilla--The Taking of Patty Hearst\" is a good, solid look at the bizarre story behind the Symbionese Liberation Army (the SLA)--how the SLA formed, what actions/crimes they committed, and how the group was finally apprehended. The film examines the political climate in 1970s America, and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary SLA. Political rhetoric aside, the SLA careened through California on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks. But more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the SLA, filmmaker Michael Stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment. \n\nUsing interviews with surviving SLA members Russ Little and Michael Bortin--as well as archival news footage of the times, the documentary examines how the SLA--led by escaped criminal DeFreeze Cinque--zoomed into the headlines after the 1974 kidnapping of Patty Hearst, daughter of William Randolph Hearst. Several members of the SLA were Berkeley students--including Emily Harris--who worked in the UC Berkeley\u0027s registrar\u0027s office. With Patty Hearst as a hostage, the SLA began making demands for food distribution for poor communities, but lest one imagines that the SLA members were driven by egalitarian motives, it must be remembered that the SLA financed their lifestyle by robbing banks. During the robbing of a bank in Carmichael, customer Myna Opsahl was shot in the stomach by a shotgun blast and left there to die.\n\nNo doubt the most shocking aspect in the history of the SLA was Patty Hearst\u0027s transformation from kidnap victim to the gun-toting \u0027Tania\u0027 (renamed for an old girlfriend of Che Guevara) who participated in several bank robberies. The documentary includes televised pleas from Hearst\u0027s parents for Patty\u0027s safety, audiotapes from Patty announcing that she\u0027s joined the group, as well as clips of Patty\u0027s former fiance, Stephen Weed. Tim Findley--a SF Chronicle reporter who covered this bizarre case--also appears adding his insightful comments. The kidnapping of Patty Hearst and her subsequent brainwashing/conversion to the SLA remains disturbing, and certainly raises many philosophical questions. Was she just an innocent kidnapping victim, or was she young and impressionable enough to be influenced by the SLA\u0027s theories on class war? Did the fact that the Hearst family is rich and powerful have any bearing on their daughter\u0027s Presidential pardon? Well watch the documentary and decide for yourself. \n\nThere\u0027s so much to be learned from watching a documentary that explores in depth an old news item that still remains locked in the archives of one\u0027s memory. DVD extras include comments by the director Michael Stone, the audiotapes by Patty Hearst, footage of the Hibernia bank robbery, and segments of court hearings between SLA members and the son of murder victim Myna Opsahl. These speeches from the former SLA members--as they try to explain and justify the murder of Opsahl--serve as a reminder of the irrevocable damage caused by taking a life--displacedhuma\n",
    "\nCertainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they don\u0027t make movies like this anymore! From the instant when the dazzling 3-D artdeco credits appear, we\u0027re onboard for the ride of our lives, actually the lives of hero Cary Grant (1904-86) and Eva Marie Saint. The plot of this 100 percent attention-keeper thickens as its characters sicken. Notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble James Mason (remember him? 1909-84) and ever-dapper Leo G. Carroll (who later played the ghost in the TV series Topper). Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant-tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore, which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting, here becoming a backdrop of life-and-death drama. Of the 50-some films of Sir Hitchcock (1899-1980) I\u0027d rate this in the top three, with Psycho and Rebecca rounding out the bases.\n",
    "\nAs I have found with most Baby Einstein movies, this one engages my very active 10-month-old baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy. While I know that watching tv too much is unhealthy, she will not even give regular television a second gland (which I\u0027m glad about). However, there are times when I need her to be more calm like when I change a diaper, try feeding new foods, and right before and after naps. These movies have been lifesavers to me. \n\nThis one in particular is nice because it is introducing the body by identifying the same parts on babies and animals. I love to give her a bath and do the \"head and shoulders, knees and toes\" song with her and point to the different parts. She also loves to stand in front of a mirror and we\u0027ll point out our eyes, mouths, etc. This movie is a great introduction for babies and toddlers to understand their body parts.\n",

Eventually it shows how the aging parents cannot bare the pain from losing their only son, the only way by which they can pass their genes, so they resort to extreme violence, even if the  violence is somewhat spiteful: \"If my son cannot pass my genes, your son who killed my son for a good genetic reason wouldn\u0027t be able to either\" - that\u0027s the subconscious motivation for murder \"conveyed\" by the genes\n",

    "\nThe film\u0027s title \"Paragraph 175\" refers to the passage in German law forbidding homosexuality. Paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871, and as a result, homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail. Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, a German Jewish doctor, and a pioneer in the study of Human Sexuality, formed the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee with the goal of repealing Paragraph 175. In Weimar Germany of the 1920s, an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals, and Berlin became a \"homosexual Eden.\" But once the Nazis took power, they enforced anti-gays laws with a vengeance. According to historian Klaus Muller, in Nazi Germany 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality, and approximately 10,000-15,000 were sent to concentration camps. Of that number, less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made. The film, gently and non-intrusively narrated by Rupert Everett, is built around interviews with a handful of homosexuals who survived the concentration camps. \n\nOnce the Nazis took power, they moved swiftly and systematically against the homosexual community. Survivors detail how they clung to vain hope--one man, for example believed that with known homosexual, Ernst Rohm controlling the Sturmabteilung (SA) other homosexuals would be safe. Another survivor noted the homosexual clubs remained open after the Nazis came to power, and he took this as a positive sign before he realized that \"they let us keep our meeting places, so we could be snatched up.\" \n\nThe survivors tell their painful stories. One man looks through a photo album in which most of the photos have now been removed; another looks at a photo of a large family gathering and is able to pick out the faces of the two relatives who survived. One remembers the screams of those hung from poles. One man spent years in Buchenwald--only to be snatched up and thrown in Dachau. While most of the survivors are unable or unwilling to describe their experiences in the concentration camps, the grief, the anger, and the outrage are just below the surface. \n\n\"Paragraph 175\" is an important, gripping, powerful film--those incarcerated, tortured and murdered for their sexual orientation should not be forgotten. The anti-homosexual movement began as a loss of Civil Rights and devolved into one of the most shameful episodes in history. To quote one of the survivors, \"I am ashamed for humanity\"--displacedhuma\n",
    "\n   Ah, Chris Benoit, one of my all-time favorites, which is why I was thrilled when I bought this DVD almost 2 years ago. Personally, I think the documentary is good and somewhat in-depth, I just would\u0027ve liked it to be longer. But it starts with Benoit\u0027s early years growing up in Canada, then to Japan, then ECW, WCW and finally WWE. \n\n   Benoit\u0027s comments make this doc. pretty good, despite the short running time (about 75 mins.), but the matches are where this DVD really shines. \n   \n   There are 15 matches in total and footage from WCW, ECW and Japan against opponents like Jushin Thunder Liger, Black Tiger (Eddie Guerrero) and Great Sasuke, which was footage I loved seeing as it was quite rare.\n\n   This is a great DVD purchase don\u0027t get me wrong, my only problem is as I said the documentary, it\u0027s very good, I love watching it, I just wanted it to be longer.\n  \n",
    "\nThis DVD provides Benoit\u0027s life story, which I found very interesting. I believe they could have chosen a slightly better match selection, but it was still pretty great.\n\nPegasus Kid VS Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger- This is the type of wrestling I love. Plenty of chain wrestling, huge Japanese crowd meaning a very quiet yet applaud filled match. This match is where Chris Benoit became a huge star in Japan. Benoit puts on a great match with a Japanese legend. 8.5/10\n\nWild Pegasus VS The Great Sasuke- This was another match with plenty of chains, and some pretty cool high flying stuff by both guys, but mainly Sasuke. Like the Liger match, this was a fast-paced and solid 20 minute match. 8.5/10\n\nWild Pegasus VS Black Tiger[Eddie Guerrero]- These two have had some far better matches, and this is one of those that I wished would have been replaced by something a little better. Still a solid match. 7/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Too Cold Scorpio[ECW]- These two have some nice chemistry together. Another 20 minute match ending just before the bell. 8/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Al Snow[ECW]- Many consider this to be a great match, but I just couldn\u0027t get into it. Slow-paced match until towards end. 6.5/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Kevin Sullivan[WCW Nitro]- This was an all out brawl, going all over the arena, including the bathrooms. Very impressive finish. 8/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Eddie Guerrero[WCW Nitro]- A very solid match with these two. Great chemistry together, Eddie and benoit show abilitiese we have not seen for awhile. 7.5/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Bret Hart[WCW Owen Hart Tribute Match]- This was a phenominal match. Bret is a true great, as is Benoit. You just don\u0027t see this sort of stuff nowadays. 9.5/10\n\nChris Benoit VS William Regal[Brian Pillman Tribute Show]-Weird lighting for this match, and not very active crowd. Besides that, Benoit and Regal put on a classic. 8/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Kurt Angle[RAW Steel Cage Match]-This match was amazing. Benoit and Angle are the finest chain wrestler in WWE today, and they put on a classic steel cage match. Stone Cold Steve Austin does guest commentary. 9/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Kurt Angle[Royal Rumble 2003 WWE Title Match]- Benoit and Angle put on another classic in the main-event of the Royal Rumble. Just a truly fantasic match with plenty of false finished, submissions and high-impact moves. 10/10\n\nChris Benoit VS Shawn Michaels VS Triple H[Wrestlemania XX World Title Match]- This is my all time favorite match. The main-event for Wrestlemania XX is often called the best Wrestlemania main-event ever, and it isn\u0027t surprising. A long, bloody match with pedigrees, sweet chin musics, sharpshooters, crossfaces, diving headbutts, and breaking tables. 10/10\n\nThis is a must-have for anyone who enjoys watching a good match. Benoit is one of the best performers in the business, and this is his story. I reccomend to all\n",
    "\n\nI\u0027ll admit to you that I love to watch Adult Swim, and I\u0027ll also admit that I like certain types of anime. No, I\u0027m not one of those nerdy card-trading Poke\u0027mon lovers, I\u0027m a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time. I like anime that\u0027s made for adults like: Big O!, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Tenchi and Ghost in the shell. \n\nI was watching either watching Family Guy or Aqua Teen Hunger Force when I saw previews for this show start to air on Adult Swim, I thought thought it looked cool, it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal, But I didn\u0027t know the half of it. \n\nWhat I got was a cyber-punk version of the old black-and-white film noir mysteries. The series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public. In the story, \u0027stand alone complex\u0027 is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal, or in other words, an imaginary criminal. It also refers to the structure of each episode: Each episode can be viewed independently of each other, and there is little catch-up (if at all) given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date. \n\nTaking place in a fictional city of Japan called \"Niihama-shi\" (New Port City) in the year 2030, Stand Alone Complex tells the story of a special operations task-force called Public Security Section 9, or simply \"Section 9\". The series follows the exploits of Section 9\u0027s agents who range from ex-military to ex-police as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level, eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as \"The Laughing Man\". \n\nPublic Security Section 9 is an elite domestic anti-crime unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of technology-related acts of terrorism and crime. Their duties include response to serious cyber crimes (i.e. Cyberbrain hacking, cyber-terrorism), investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases. From time-to-time they also serve as protection to foreign VIPs. \n\nIf you have seen the movie then you know that the TV series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology. Instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology, presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole. The series of 26 half-hour TV episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga. In comparison to the film version, the series is considered by many to be easier to understand. Also, in comparison, the series can be found to be closer to the manga; due to the presence of some humor, the usage of the Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga, and referred to simply as \"tanks\" in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in), the design of the characters, and also, the usage of the characters Paz, Bouma and Saito. Stand Alone Complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of Production I.G. in their application of computer generated imagery. This is evident in their digital color grading, environmental effects, and cell-shaded computer models. Their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene, which adds greatly to the atmosphere. \n\nI think a lot of people will try to compare this to Cowboy Bebop as with so many other anime and mangas, but that\u0027s foolish. Stand Alone Complex is no better or worse than Cowboy Bebop, it\u0027s just a different story, different style, different sets of charactors and there places. \n\nif you like anime or manga you\u0027ll definitely like this show. It\u0027s complex, has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it, and not to mention the technology! Even if you don\u0027t watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is.\n",
    "\nMy wife and I saw \"Love Actually\" when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly. Yes, Richard Curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings, but it works.  And the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in.\n\nWhen the movie first appeared on HBO, I always seem to find it and couldn\u0027t stop watching until the end of the movie.  I bought the DVD and it\u0027s become a family tradition to watch it Christmas Eve (most years).  And it never gets old.\n\nI am not a fan of Christmas movies.  I\u0027ve never seen all of \"Miracle on 34th Street\" or \"Its a Wonderful Life\", but I\u0027m looking forward to sitting on the sofa with my wife to watch \"Love Actually\" again\n",
    "\na solid addition to the rockumentary genre. this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars.\n\nlooking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career (and arguably he was solo with the police). at the time of this movie, it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting. the music is super, the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness\n",
    "\nJohn Ford must have felt very fortunate (although he would have never have admitted it)to have had John Wayne and Henry Fonda star in Fort Apache. \n\nWayne and Fonda were by far the great director\u0027s favorite leading men - he made Wayne a star in \"Stagecoach,\" and went on to direct him in some of the best-loved, best remembered Westerns ever, \"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,\" \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\" and one of the greatest movies of any genre, \"The Searchers.\" Fonda appeared in many movies with Ford as well, including \"Drums Along The Mohawk,\" \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" and another immortal Western, \"My Darling Clementine.\"\n\nFollowing a pattern that he would continue in \"Liberty Valance,\" Ford analyzes the mythology of the West, in particular the valiant heroic cavalry officer who bravely and unavoidably leads his men to certain death, thereby obtaining immortal glory. Fonda plays an arrogant, by-the-book stiff commander who will have nothing less than a to-the-death struggle with Cochise. Wayne is his subordinate, trying desperately to avoid catasrophe.\n\nThis film has it all, great performances, great direction, and great cinematography. It is way past time that this great film be released on DVD, but it is well worth the wait\n",
    "\n\nI was very keen on the early Poseidon adventure which I liked. So I was keen to see what Wolgang Petersen, a director I do like, could do with the story.\n\nIt found it to being a good movie. It did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next. So much so I lost track of time throughout the movie.\n\nHaving said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort. In which case, I would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original. The characters are not so interesting nor is the acting. The story was better explained in the first one and more believable. The special effects are approximately as good. The filming however is better as the newer technology shows.\n\nStill it is worth looking at.\n\n\n",
    "\nThis movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to.  It demonstrates how connected we all are as people, and how seperated we are by only one thing - our viewpoints.  \n\nThe acting is superb, and you get one cameo appearance after another, which is a treat.  Of course, the soundtrack is terrific.  The ending is intense to witness, one situation after another coming to an unfortunate finish. \n",
    "\nThis movie has it all, especially for baby boomers of the early 1970\u0027s. Blethyn, as a betrayed widow is priceless and Nigel Ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks. The English scenery is charming and Blethyn\u0027s loyal village friends top off the movie\u0027s touching humor and happy ending. I have given this DVD as Christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too. A MUST OWN\n",
    "\n\n\nThis is a wonderful inside-Hollywood thriller/comedy directed by Robert Altman. Tim Robbins stars as a big shot producer who begins receiving hate mail from one of his rejected writers. He thinks he\u0027s figured out who it is (Vincent D\u0027Onofrio), goes to meet him, and in a rage kills him. He then falls in love with D\u0027Onofrio\u0027s weird girlfriend (Gretta Scacchi), an artist who can\u0027t ever finish anything. There is also a movie within the movie which has to do with the making of a melodrama in which an innocent woman is about to be executed - only to be rescued at the last minute by the D.A. Altman\u0027s theme has to do with  the Hollywood version of reality, which is nothing more than what will earn big bucks; it has nothing to do with \"truth.\" A long list of Hollywood stars make cameo appearances. It\u0027s really a well-done movie, very classy and hip. Altman also satirizes Hollywood power players extremely well - it\u0027s a whole other world out there in LaLa land\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve actually been hoping for a live CD release, but I was more than happy with this DVD. All the favorites are here (only a minor gripe with the omission of Echo and 11am, and the inclusion of Priceless, but that\u0027s just personal preference). This is all the evidence needed to show that this band has reached maturity. Drive is an unexpected change, but being the most played-out song in their lineup, the obscurity is welcome. The musical talent all around seems much improved from the previous DVDs, and each member gets to show off all their new tricks. Unlike some other bands, Incubus seems to perfectly display each musician\u0027s talents so well with each song, and this -for me- showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly. Every song is a highlight on this one - my favorites are Made for TV Movie and Sick Sad Little World.\nOther notes: It\u0027s the perfect place to film for a DVD; We get to see Brandon play guitar and how well Ben works as a backup singer; and I think Jose could make any rock band sound good. Recommended for any fan of Incubus, especially of their newer material\n",
    "\nWhen I first found the Broadway Lost Treasure Serier on Amazon, I nearly jumped up and down in my seat. Any Broadway clips that I can get a hold of I definitly must get. I bought Broadway Lost Treasure I and Broadway Lost Treasures II together. I must say the performances were very good, just because you can\u0027t call broadway bad. The way the performances were put together, however, was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes. Dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic(Jerry Orbach,Angela Lansbery.etc)some of my favorite people, but I wanted I little bit more background information on the shows and things like that.\n\nOverall, I encourage purchasing Broadway Lost Treasures II(and the first one),if you keep an open mind. If you dont know alot about broadway, then this will bore you to tears. This is not what you should purchase if you want to learn more about broadway. If you are more interested in learning more about broadway, rather than just seeing performances, then I would buy \"Broadway: The American Musical\" (which can be found on Amazon).\n\n",
    "\nI bought this as a dvd for home use.  I won\u0027t repeat the story as others have done so already.  I loved the story.  The plot was well put together and solid.  The acting was wonderful.  I have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time I see it. I really am enjoying the fun of this film.  I\u0027d suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film.  It is made to be light with family values of what counts in life.    Tim did an outstanding job as he always does. The chasing scenes with Tim on all fours becoming a dog; the dog behaviors as a human had me rolling. It is one of the funniest films I\u0027ve seen in a long time.  As an adult I loved it and would buy it again. I\u0027m thrilled to see Disney making such terrific and wonderful films.  It was tastefully done.  The caged scenes were carefully done.  No bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the Disney films.  And no I didn\u0027t perceive this as a film geared toward small children.  Perhaps pre-teens and up would be my guess.  To demean the film based on the expectation that tiny children would appreciate the story is not realistic nor does it do justice for what the film is.  It is a wonderful film with a great storyline!!  corinn\n",
    "\nDas Boot is an epic film that is very well done. I loved the suspense and terrific character moments. The thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a Nazi U-boat in the midst of the Atlantic during 1941 WWII. Going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean. The three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film.\n\nThis movie is now one of the top ten movies of all time for me.\n\nIn viewing the DVD, I chose to turn on English Subtitles while also selecting the English 2.0 spoken language. What is interesting is how the english dub has paraphrased certain lines and in others totally changed every meaning behind the statements. I\u0027m talking about the line that, in German, reads something like \"I can\u0027t wait to get back home and f**k the h*ll out of a few wild wh**es!\" is rewritten and dubbed as \"When I get home I\u0027m going to shower and sleep until December!\" Quite a drastic change. But of course, sailors in the German Navy use language that I suppose is unacceptable - even in an \"R\" rated movie - for English audiences... \n\nThere are more than fifteen conversations of that nature that have been translated into English subtitles from the German language spoken in the original dub of the film, while the English dub is totally different. Later in the film, there are even lines shown in subtitles that are not spoken at all in the English dub. Very interesting and fun to watch.\n\nEven with the subtitles on, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I love the epic movies that run well over two and a half hours. This one clocks in at a good four and a half hours! It draws you in and keeps you going from the very first moment to the very last explosion... \n\nOne of the best war movies I have ever seen!\n\nOne of the most interesting ironies of this film is that the entire movie takes place within the Nazi U-boat and we get to see and feel compassion for the German men who fight to keep the boat afloat. The irony occurs when the Allied forces attack them and we get to experience the other side of the equation. Very intense and dramatic\n",

The best part of course is the Christian music!  These videos are top quality and my daughter loves them - she gets bored very quickly with Baby Einstein. \n",
    "\nHis words to the jury, a petition for strength for them against great odds, for himself against greater odds, for a system sometimes blind to justice, and for the victim of negligence who has no voice, puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of \u0027The Verdict.\u0027\n\nTV bytes and news reports of lawyers\u0027 greed today have surpassed the image of scoundrels as nearly all of us now just leave them to their money-grubbing best. And the courage and brilliance of \"Brown v. Board\" and \"Heart of Atlanta\" exemplifying courageous men and women doing what is best fade into a distant past. But once in while a movie (\u0027Mockingbird\u0027) comes along and moves powerfully to recall what it was that attracted us to the beauty of this ancient profession: to do what is right, or even better, to do what is right against great odds.\n\nFrank Galvin, drunk, ambulance chaser, liar, failure, had that dream once but a mistake, an error of judgemnt, a naive trust in loyalty that was gravely misplaced led him to where he is now, sucking on breath mints and bourbon, handing out cards, working for booze money.\n\nHis old friend Jack Warden handed him a case, a no-brainer, a lovely Irish girl who went into labor and came out brain dead. The Defendants? A squeaky clean, Chaired, lauded, published and handsome OBGYN and  . . . . the Diocese of Boston. And Frank\u0027s going to cave. Hell. It\u0027s the eve of trial and he\u0027s been drunk through the 24 months of discovery. And then he prepares for the Settlement Conference with the Dfense Lawyer, James Mason (just positively brilliant) and goes to the girls hospital room where she is machine fed and takes photos. But a funny thing happens. Lke Marcellus (Burton) winning the Robe in the lottery at the foot of the cross or a drunk at his first AA meeting, Frank\u0027s not sure but something\u0027s different. And he begins to wonder if maybe this time he won\u0027t cave.\n\nGreat, morbid, wry, ironic, gallows humor. Warden says after the Settlement Conference, \"whadja\u0027 think of (Mason)?\" Galvin: He\u0027s good. Warden: Good? He\u0027s the  [. . . . .] Prince of Darkness. \n\nA cast that you have heard of and seen a thousand times and some that you would never see again all working together to bring you a blue collar story of the good thief. I don\u0027t know that there is a better trial movie.\n\nPeople say that Newman lost but wasn\u0027t robbed for the Oscar because Ben Kingley was so wonderful in Ghandi.\n\nHe was robbed. 5 stars.

    "\nIt is a Gene Kelly vehichle and there are three wartime buddies, but that\u0027s pretty much where the \"On The Town\" similarities end. It is a surprisingly sharp, cynical story in which the protagonist\u0027s dreams do *not* initially come true- due to life circumstances. Betty Comden and the late Adolph Green- responsible for so many great film scores as well as the scripts of \"Auntie Mame,\" \"Bells Are Ringing,\" and \"What A Way To Go-\" contribute very witty songs here, including the Danubian tri-liloquy sung by the guys and Dolores Gray\u0027s \"Thanks A Lot, But No Thanks\" and \"Music Is Better than Words (delivered with a rich, smooth contralto).\" I wish Kelly and Charisse had danced together (the omission makes the film appear a bit empty), but my favorite numbers are still his garbage-can dance through the streets and her sexy sweater-and-skirt dance with the boxers, \"Baby, You Knock Me Out.\" And I would\u0027ve liked the roller-skating finale better if it didn\u0027t have a big, looming, piece of the \"Singin\u0027 In The Rain\" set in the background\n",

    "\nsamurai champloo has been a great series, and this third dvd has kept that tradition. though the last episode was weak, as most recap episodes are, the other three episodes made up for it, and then some. around the time this came out, fans of the series were starting to buy the dvd\u0027s more due to the shortage of episodes on adult swim, as the last episode on this dvd is as far as adult swim would broadcast(they did start to broadcast more shortly after dvd six). below are my ratings for this dvd and it\u0027s episodes.\n\n\nepisode nine: beatbox bandits- this episode, though not very good, still has some funny scenes and some action. mugen jin and fuu are caught trying to pass through a checkpoint with counterfiet passes. the checkpoint officials find out that they did not make the forgeries, and cut a deal. mugen is sent to do one of their croked errands. will mugen stay true to his companions? watch and find out.\ni rate this episode a 5/10, simply because it lacked action and plot, plus the man telling the story is looking back thirty years to when the episode occured. i don\u0027t know, maybe it\u0027s the thought of jin mugen and fuu being old, but i don\u0027t dig the old man looking that far back.\n\nepisode ten: lethal lunacy- one of my favorite, if not my all time favorite, SC episodes! this episode kicks anus in every way possible! i dont want to reveal to much of the story line, but i reccomend watching this episode! even if this dvd just had this episode and was still full price, i would still buy it!\ni rate this episode a -/-, or infinite. if you really want stars, it is 10/10, though i find that underappreciating the episode to give it a finite rating\n\nepisode eleven: gamblers and gallentry- jin falls in love with a depressed woman who has been forced to work in a whore-house to pay off her husbands debt. still a good episode, but not the best. lots of great humor.\ni rate this episode 7/10.\n\nepisode twelve: the disorder diaries- recap episode. jin and mugen read fuu\u0027s diary while she takes a bath. this episode has a lot of funny dialogue, but that\u0027s the only thing it has working for it.\ni rate this episode 3/10\n\nwell, that\u0027s it for this review. check out my next review on volume four of samurai champloo.\ni hope this review helped.\npeace\n",

You get 5 Christmas TV classics in a collectors case along with a 20 song sing-a-long CD. And for 25 bucks that is a deal you can\u0027t beat. That\u0027s roughly 5 bucks a show not including the CD. I got this set just so my 5 year old can grow up watching some of the \"good\" Christmas shows that I did.\n",
    "\nTwo years later, the Red Sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in September thinking it never happened.  It was a utopian dream, the comfort of the drugged and sleeping.\n\nBut it *did* happen. It\u0027s here on film.  They couldn\u0027t have made this all up and - besides - I remember it. Like it was yesterday.\n\nThe producers of this DVD didn\u0027t have much of a World Series series to work with. The Sox swept the Cardinals in four.  \n\nThe real drama was the American League Championship Series.\n\nStill, the producers have done a remarkable job of building the context of the Curse of the Bambino, the tragedy snatched from the jaws of triumph in years that are branded into the thighs and brains of Red Sox fans - 1967, 1975, 1986 - the new Spring hopes that make one feel a little foolish. The mind games. The despair. The self-loathing.\n\nIt all ended in 2004. \n\nIt\u0027s right here on film.\n\nThe names now fit comfortably beside those of Yaz and the rest of Fenway\u0027s venerable ghosts: Schilling, Damon (still beloved in pinstripes), Pedro, Millar, Derek Lowe, Trot, Big Papi, Manny Being Manny, \u0027Skip\u0027 Francona, the undyingly heroic field captain \u0027Tek\u0027 Varitek, the man paid to steal one base (Dave Roberts). The gutsy trade of Nomar.\n\nThen there were the demons of this passion play: All the Yankees, but particularly A-Rod, who played the part of a bizarrely emasculated Lucifer. And all the Yankees, again. And again.\n\nEverybody else was just there that season for bit parts and background noise for Big Papi\u0027s walkoff homers and Curt Schillings epochal bloody sock, the crux of Red Sox Nation\u0027s unlikely redemption.\n\nA Red Sox fan watching this DVD for the fifth time can still not suppress the goosebumps. \n\nWhere were we for this game? And that game? The true fans among us are slightly embarrassed about the fact that we remember where, a stroke of intellectual capacity that is supposed to be reserved for truly international events.\n\nAs I write this in mid-October, 2006, the Sox are at home and Detroit is facing off with Oakland for the American League Championship.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t matter.  We won. It\u0027s right there on the DVD.  Plus, the soundtrack is brilliant.\n\nIt all ends in glory after all, not ashes.  Redemption\n",
    "\nI\u0027m mildly into anime, I only watch the stuff that I really enjoy. This is the only series that has really drawn me in.

    "\nThis anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network, and now is definetly considered a classic alongside Cowboy Bebop and others. This is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people. Yoko Kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect. It\u0027s so beautiful and fits the story so well. The overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful. \n\nAs for the languages and region, while I wouldn\u0027t know yet for this particular box set, I would assume it is just like the individual DVDs they put out with Japanese and English language and English subtitles. And I don\u0027t know where to look for the region of the DVD, but I think it might be region 1, whatever it means. I do know that I haven\u0027t had any troubles playing it on any of our DVD players.\n\n[...]\n\n",
    "\nThis is a very emotional film.  It induces emotion in the viewer, and for that I give it five stars.  I\u0027m more interested in constructive criticism than in praise, so even though I think it is an excellent film, I will just focus on what I think is wrong with it.\n\nOne problem is that Blanche DuBois is simply too pretty for the role.  We don\u0027t understand, on a gut level, why this beautiful girl would worry about hiding behind dim lighting.  The script makes it clear that she is supposed to look \"old\", and yet she doesn\u0027t.  That\u0027s a fault of the film.  It makes her final passionate scene with Karl Malden incomprehensible.  He holds her up to the light, she looks very pretty, and yet we are supposed to believe that she looks terrible in bright light.  For that I blame the director, Elia Kazan.  What in God\u0027s name could he have been thinking of, and why did he mess up so badly on that important detail?\n\nAnother important fault of this film is that Stanley Kowalski\u0027s attack on Blanche isn\u0027t set up properly.  Are we just supposed to believe that he is an animal, and chalk it up to that?  Sorry, not good enough.  We should have seen it coming.  Again, another big mess-up by Kazan.  When the script has the characters doing something that doesn\u0027t ring true, there\u0027s a problem.  We needed to see that attack being led up to.  We needed to think \"Oh my god, I know what he is about to do.\"\n\nStanley Kowalski is actually the good guy throughout most of the movie.  All of a sudden it turns.  It\u0027s incomprehensible.  Somewhere between the writing, directing, and acting, somebody dropped the ball somewhere.  The Stanley Kowalski who attacks Blanche is not the same man who appears earlier in the film.  He\u0027s not an \"animal\".  He\u0027s not set up that way for us. Blanche is the snob, and Stanley is okay, but that is turned on its head at the end.\n\nInsanity is a nice little copout.  We can make our actors do anything, and just say okay, they went nuts.  Very touching, but not very realistic.  How does someone go insane?  What stages do they go through?  Blanche\u0027s descent into insanity, into an inability to tell reality from fantasy, should have been more realistic, more researched, more consistent with the way it actually happens.  It does happen to people, people who are extremely bipolar, people who are schizophrenic.  More research should have been done, to show what the descent into insanity actually does look like.\n\nI have high standards, but that\u0027s a good thing, I think.  Still, I\u0027ve given this film five stars\n",
    "\nI first saw this movie in high school in the theater.  I was extremely moved by the film, and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day - I even work half the year in Sri Lanka now.  So for me, personally, this movie is of tremendous influence.\n\nI understand the arguements about the crediting of non-white actors; I always wondered why Candice Bergman is given top billing, given that she only appears in a very few scenes.  Well, that\u0027s the way of the world - it\u0027s marketing right or wrong, and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known.  It\u0027s not right, but that\u0027s Hollywood. I mean, better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all, yes?\n\nAnd you\u0027ve got to admit, it was quite a debut for Ben Kingsly. Wow.  He\u0027ll be forever known for this role.\n\nThat aside, this is an excellent, amazing film.  Of course, it\u0027s still highly relevant, perhaps even more so in our post-911 world of fear.  \n\nThe movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration.  A must-see for anyone who feels anger, fear, agressively nationalistic, hopelessness, hatred, or lost.  I can think of several politicans who need to see this movie\n",
    "\nI didn\u0027t have high expectations for this movie, but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times.  I\u0027ve always like Tom Cruise and he doesn\u0027t disappoint in this movie.  But the real star is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader-what perfect casting! And Koyuki as the Samurai widow was just plain gorgeous.  The HD DVD transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better.  Highly recommended\n",
    "\nI think this is a beautiful story about a man, who wanted to change his country. He was not looking for his lost money, he wanted a new Hungary.

Everyone, who like dramas, the 19th century, real heros... have to see this wonderful movie\n",
    "\n\nThere have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one. \n\nWe should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions  \n\nOn the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.\n\nOne more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and \"Requiem for a dream\". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major. \n  \nExcellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh. \n",

    "\nOn the face of it, a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi-romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as \"niche\" as you can get, but don\u0027t overlook this film. The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you\u0027ll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a \"coming of age\" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours\n",
    "\nA friend with a three year old told us about this product and we purchased it.  Wow!  Our three year old girl kept wanting to watch it over and over.

    "\nThe stellar performances of Jason Alexander (Buzz) and John Glover (James/John) make this movie, providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film. The Swan Lake scene, while funny, is probably the most sad, as each character explains how he will pass on. \n\nYet the most interesting character to me is Gregory, as he is the glue that holds this group of men together, generously offering his Victorian house for holiday vacations. It is he who starts the film with his narration, welcoming the viewer in as if we are a visitor to his home as well, and having the final narration during the Swan Lake scene. He is caretaker to his friends in life and in death, and the central character that the six others revolve around; it is befitting that he will be the last to go.\n \nEach character struggles with his own demons; we are privy to their personal pain, yet all manage to rise above their problems and find joy in life and with each other\u0027s companionship. Even the most detestable character, John, is not entirely unsympathetic.\n\nYes, there\u0027s some stereotypical moments, but all in all, this is an enjoyable film, one that leaves an indelible impression\n",
    "\nThis movie is a great movie to add to your DVD collection.  Especially if you are a mob fan.  This movie is about corruption within the mob, about betrayal, about death and dying.  It starts off with someone trying to whack the don, and the family trying to find out who it is and why.  I\u0027m not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story.  Just watch it.  Mario Puzo\u0027s The Last Don (1997) was great too\n",
    "\nI don\u0027t own this series, but I watch it on PBS. It\u0027s great. They cover a limited number of words per episode, and I\u0027m grateful; it can get a little overwhelming. My 2 1/2 year old daughter only does a few signs, but she\u0027s able to decipher anything I sign to her. I know \"Mama\", \"Hungry\", \"Want,\" \"Cookie\"... For now that will have to do for \"Mama is hungry, she wants a cookie.\" You\u0027ll catch other words from the songs. Go to the Signing Time website. They have sample videos, and lyrics, you\u0027ll get the idea. A little at a time is good enough for me. Expert proficiency is not my expectation here. Five Stars\n",
    "\nI love this series and plan to buy more.  It is well done.  The signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting, or watch the whole dvd.  The word is first shown, then a mom shows the sign, then kids demonstrate (including some use of the actual object, if appropriate).  My child and I have both picked up signs quickly from this DVD\n",
    "\n\"The Bad Sleep Well\" is a forgotten gem from one of Japan\u0027s great masters, Akira Kurosawa. His other two Shakespeare adaptations, \"Throne of Blood\" (Macbeth) and \"Ran\" (King Lear), are much more famous and well-regarded, justifiably so if you have seen them (\"Ran\" is particular is my favorite of all Kurosawa films). However, this sharp and caustic adaptation of Hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition. It may be the most bleak subject matter that Kurosawa ever tackled - the corruption in the highest levels of government in post-war Japan.\n\nThe film begins with a long but funny wedding sequence that illustrates Kurosawa\u0027s great skill as a director. We (and the camera) are among a group of reporters discussing the numerous convenient reasons for the marriage; the bride is lame and the daughter of Iwabuchi, the head of corporation,  and the bridegroom, Nishi, has aspirations to elevate his status in the business. We see the comedy of manners play out in this sequence in increasingly humorous situations as the various parties deny these rumours and reporters comment to each other, culminating in the panicked looks on the faces of the corporate higher-ups as the wedding cake arrives - in the shape of their office building, Public Corp., with a red X marking a spot in one of the windows where one of their former partners commited suicide. It\u0027s a virtuoso sequence that perfectly sets up the tone of the rest of the film.\n\nThe newspapers have a field day with this, especially when various members of Public Corp. are investigated for fraud and embezzlement, yet they stoically remain silent and the case goes nowhere. Then it heats up again as a few of them commit suicide; the rumours are that they were goaded into doing so (n fact, they were). However, without any substance to press the matter, the case is dropped. And that\u0027s when the real story begins - one of the Public Corp executives, Wada, survives and is rescued by Nishi and his shadowy accomplice, Itakura.\n\nThis is followed by a brilliant scene in which Wada is taken to his own funeral and observes the farce - all the while, Nishi plays him a tape with Moriyama and Shirai, his former partners, plotting his murder. The way Kurosawa stages this is masterful; the sublime music emanating from the funeral is contrast dramatically with the cold-blooded words of Public Corp, as Wada listens on. One of the ways Wada contributes is to scare the living hell out of Shirai - Wada poses as a ghost of himself in order to freak out Shirai (a pointed but clever method of tying in the ghost in Hamlet). As the plot progresses, Nishi reveals his reasons for saving Wada and exacting a very personal revenge on Iwabuchi and his cohorts; the story\u0027s pace becomes more frantic and exciting.\n\nTechnically, Kurosawa is at his best here. The wedding and the funeral are both marvels and they contrast each other perfectly. He uses a lot of intriguing mise-en-scene compostions for his interiors that serve to highlight his characters\u0027 inner thoughts but very little movement of the camera in order to manipulate his audience; the dark nature of the story is enough to suck you in. One of the fascinating observations in \"The Bad Sleep Well\" is that all of the characters are morally bankrupt and filled with secrets - even Nishi, the protagonist. His wife, the Ophelia character, is the only one that Kurosawa allows us to feel sympathy for, and even then in the end she is not fully spared her grief. Taken in this context, Kurosawa\u0027s Hamlet becomes a study in the morality and pragmatism of revenge but also an incisive jab at the fat cats in modern Japan.\n\nIf there is a flaw in the film, it is that the overall pacing is not always brisk enough to sustain the long running time (2 1/2 hours). The wedding, despite being absolutely essential, is protracted; the rest of the film is much quicker but still drags in parts. Also, Kurosawa seems unsure about his ending; the film ends quite abruptly but appropriately in terms of his larger point about the hopelesness of fighting the rampant corruption, I would argue. However, despite these flaws, overall \"The Bad Sleep Well\" is a masterful and dark excursion into the seedy side of corporate crime, using Shakespeare Hamlet brilliantly but not completely as it\u0027s core. Toshiro Mifune in particular gives one of his most unique low-key performances; instead of his usual fiery exterior we get a performance full of internalized anger throughout. Highly reccomended\n",
    "\n\"The Thomas Crown Affair\" gets better everytime I watch it. I spot something I missed. Hear music which I heard but never listened to and see how it relates to the movie.

Just don\u0027t expect exactly what you got from the novel. Over all I give it four stars.\n\n",
    "\n  I waited years for this movie to be released in the United States.

All women live in similar locations, though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth. All encounters are odd, the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident. She was number 5 in the list of \"suspects\" for the mother of the phantom son.\nDon\u0027t watch this film if you need action or a plot.

    "\n\"The Medium\" instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005.  I usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal, which tuned me in.  However, it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating.  Patricia Arquette who was in \"Ed Wood\" with Johnny Depp plays Alison DuBois.  Her Emmy win for Best Actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry, but the on-screen chemistry with Jake Weber who was in \"Meet Joe Black\" and plays her husband Joe is riveting.  They fight, spat, try to mask conflict in front of their kids, juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks, and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of Alison\u0027s psychic ability.  I found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show, I still wanted to watch them over episodes of CSI Miami that I had not seen.   When I bought the DVD, I was hoping there might have been an episode I\u0027d missed, but I\u0027d seen them all between NBC \u0026 Lifetime reruns several times.  I\u0027m impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing.  Alison\u0027s dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together.  What impresses me about Alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing.  In a world of violence, it\u0027s often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points.  In the episode \"In Sickness \u0026 Adultery\" her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her.  As she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife, she finds that her best defense is the truth.  The two older daughters are also jewels.  Maria Lark as Bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream, \"Mom, please stop doing that!\"  Sofia Vassilieva as the older Aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing.  David Cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of Detective Lee Scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with Arquette.  Miguel Sandoval as the district attorney Manuel Duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show.  (Perhaps we will sometime see more about his family.)  While it\u0027s hard to pick my favorite first season episode, the complex plot of \"A Priest, A Doctor \u0026 Medium Walk into an Execution Chamber\" is a jewel, with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder.  The DVD commentaries and introduction to the real-life Alison DuBois really give excellent background for fans of the show.  This is one show that reaches the level of art for me.  Its excellence will make it memorable for a long time \u0026 this DVD collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection.  Bravo\n",

    "\nWhile I\u0027ve always loved Blade Runner, the so-called \"Theatrical Cut\" was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation.  Harrison Ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped.  But Hollywood, in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience\u0027s intelligence and artistic sensitivity, stuck with it anyway, on the assumption that we needed to be spoon-fed with sophomoric incompetence.\n\nEqually stupid, though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted, was the inappropriate sappy ending, which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well.  It didn\u0027t even make any sense: the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars.  But Hollywood, with characteristic cowardice, trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience.  Rick Deckard\u0027s fate at the end of the Director\u0027s Cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982, and the subsequent VHS audience.  It reminds me of what Orion Pictures did to George Romero\u0027s Monkeyshines. (Since when does a Romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots?)  Or how about the \"happy ending\" grotesquely grafted onto Terry Gilliam\u0027s Brazil?\n\nThe extra footage between Deckard and Rachael, while not extensive, enriches the characterizations, however modestly, and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end.  The only thing I regret is that the extra bloody footage - in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes - found on the old VHS tape was not included in the Director\u0027s Cut.  Which means that this is not fully the Director\u0027s Cut: the material was left out to garner the sacred, almighty \"R\" rating upon the film\u0027s re-release, as it was the first time around.  One would think it would have been restored on DVD, but Warner, with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude, decided against it.  They probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that Ridley Scott would have wanted it that way.  Can anyone say \"Eyes Wide Shut\"?\n\nThe fact that there are viewers course enough to value the \"theatrical cut\" and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that Hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all.   And \"definitive\" the Director\u0027s Cut is: despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage, there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again, by anyone. \n",

There is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn - no hard choreography either.  I use this w/ a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one I enjoy to return to.\n\nThere are 3 segments each focusing on a different section: core, upper and lower body.

The movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience\u0027s attention, allows for us to actually *feel* what Robert Kennedy is feeling, to sense the tension during chaotic times, and most importantly, to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for America.\n\nThis movie is extremely well-balanced, provides excellent insight to the inner mind/heart of Robert Kennedy, and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from Kennedy\u0027s life.  \n\nIf you are looking to pick one movie on Robert Kennedy - this is it.

He spent quite a bit of time explaining how hard it was for them to get Superman started, then we\u0027re quickly through the comics and the Kirk Alyn eras, then it slows down for a long retrospective of the George Reeves years, both in Superman and the Mole Men and The Adventures of Superman, then it blows through again through the comics and the animated series of the 50s, 60s and 70s, then stops again for a lengthy study of Superman: the Movie, then briefly about Superman II, Superman III, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and Superboy, then briefly on Lois \u0026 Clark: The New Adventures of Superman and Superman: The Animated Series, and then we slow down again for a lengthy study of Smallville, and then it becomes a big commercial for Superman Returns. \n\nOr at least that\u0027s how I perceived it. Singer\u0027s got great respect for George Reeves, Superman: The Movie (and Christopher Reeve), and Smallville ... and that\u0027s pretty much it. Most anything else, he quickly blew through as if it were completely non-consequential. Well, except for his own movie, but I expected that part; produced by Bryan Singer and narrated by Kevin Spacey, you\u0027d have to be pretty stupid not to realize that at least a chunk of it would be dedicated to selling the new movie. I had to turn it off at that point. Not that I disliked Superman Returns, but as soon as Kevin Spacey said how the actors in Superman Returns were \"perfect\" for their roles and then began discussing way-too-young Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, I started getting nausiated. \n\nI will give credit, they were remarkably honest with their assessments of the various projects. I loved it when Annette O\u0027Toole, a self-avowed fan of the character who played Lana Lang in Superman III and Martha Kent on Smallville, expresses shock that there was actually a Superman IV (\"There was a Superman IV!? I never saw that one!\" - she didn\u0027t miss much); I thought it was refreshing that though they never got nasty about stuff, if a movie was a disappointment or a comic storyline flopped, they pretty much admitted it. And I liked that Ilya Salkind was willing to take some of the blame for the bad blood that happened behind the scenes of Superman: The Movie and Superman II; it reflected well on him that he didn\u0027t just blame Richard Donner, as he might have been apt to do while they were doing their fighting back in the day. \n\nBut I do think it needed more balance. We didn\u0027t need to spend quite so much time watching clips of George Reeves or of seeing Christopher Reeve with his sweat stains; those moments and the stuff from Smallville could have been trimmed down nicely to give more time to other elements, perhaps more of The Animated Series/Justice League Unlimited era or to Lois and Clark. There were also some moments where they went back to talking about the comics, even though it was periods where nothing significant was happening in the comics; as if someone said, hey, we haven\u0027t acknoweledged that the comics are still in production at this point, we should say something. Thus too making the whole thing feel dry and unbalanced. \n\nBTW, I recognized a comic from my own personal collection! There\u0027s a three-panel shot at one moment where the ground is scorched into the \"S\" symbol, then a hand comes up out of the dirt and then Clark appears and walks off. I have that comic -- it\u0027s an alternate storyline issue, the first time they kill off Superman and in the same issue, Superman and Lois wed (and this was all long before Doomsday). It\u0027s actually a very cool story. \n",
    "\nSaw the names Kathy Bates, Barry Manilow and Julie Andrews, so had to give it a view.  Best film ever.  Best lines in a film ever as well,\n \"Julie Andrews is in the cockpit.\"\n\"Thank god.\"\n\nThat alone has enriched my life beyond measure\n",
    "\nOnly the timidity of the studios could explain how this movie landed on the shelves without even a mention - It\u0027s up to word of mouth to save it. And it\u0027s certainly worth saving. Nobody does the \"awakening matron\" like Kathy Bates (see \"Fried Green Tomatoes\"), and her Grace Beasley is a delight as she finds her backbone and her voice. She needs it. Her daughter-in-law (Meredith Eaton) is an acid-tongued dwarf with no inhibitions, and Dan Ackroyd is the wettest blanket this side of the Johnstown flood. After being dumped by her husband, patronized by her son, and deprived of her grandson, Grace has no choice but to look after herself. Grace goes to England to attend the funeral of her idol - Jonathan Pryce in fine voice and having the time of his life - and meets his gay lover, Rupert Everett. After swallowing her shock, the unlikely pair returns to Chicago to track down Pryce\u0027s  murderer. The performances are all fine, the pace is feathery, the music easy on the ear...It\u0027s all whimsical and preposterous, and the kind of movie that will have you laughing out loud when you\u0027re sitting home alone...The ultimate test of a comedy. \"Unconditional Love\" passes the test. Enjoy it and spread the word\n",
    "\nI love this video.  I get up before anyone else so that I can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long.  It\u0027s a fantastic meditation, though, that centers me for the entire day.  Ravi Singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear.  Ana Brett does the poses very clearly, and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses.  I have already recommended this video to friends\n",
    "\nThis DVD is a must have for anyone interested in beginning Kundalini yoga.  The moves flow into each other easily and you can go at your own pace.  This DVD has everything: meditation, relaxation, mantras, stretching, wonderful music, beautifully narrated and professionally presented.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!\n",
    "\n\"Office Space\" is a very funny comedy. Many parts of the film were a delight. In the beginning, when everyone is stalled in traffic, I knew the feeling. Working at Initech Corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston). Besides having a job he hates, he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is. Then there is his boss Lumbergh--an arrogant jerk. Life for Peter Gibbons is just one boring day after another. That is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion [and demands] of his then girlfriend.\n\nWhile undergoing hypnotic suggestion, the psychologist dies of a heart-attack. But Peter is now a changed man. He no longer cares about his job, and says whatever\u0027s on his mind. And his boss Lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new Peter. When Peter learns of the impending layoff [courtesy of John C. McGinley and his partner] at Initech Corporation, he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus.  His two fellow co-workers and friends are only too happy to go along: afterall, they\u0027re part of the layoff\u0027s. And on top of that, the company men want to make Peter a supervisor. \n\nThis film is funny on many levels. With Jennifer Anniston as the love interest of Peter, and the character actors that make up the film--it makes for an enjoyable watch. Jennifer Anniston\u0027s character and her dealings with her boss and his \"FLAIRS\" are also funny. This is a highly recommended comedy. I\u0027m sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between Peter and his boss Lumbergh. And the character of his boss Lumbergh is delightfully hilarious: Especially the way he talks. The whole movie is very funny and wonderful. Highly recommended. \n",
    "\n(3.5/5 stars) Listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly, ashen-faced with blank stares; where is the horror in that? Sounds like a typical Sunday afternoon at the mall to me. In fact, Dawn of the Dead (1978) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film. More or less picking up where \"Night of the Living Dead\" left off, zombies are on the hunt for prey across Pennsylvania. Four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies. They take refuge in a shopping mall, which provides just about everything they need. They work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure. The walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and don\u0027t bring much in the way of strategy. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they weren\u0027t so tenacious. The four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the TV of bombing areas of high zombie concentration. They have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere. What does fate have in store for them? \"The Night of the Living Dead\" took place, obviously, at night and in the dark, which provided a much more frightening backdrop. It was also in black and white, which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make-up. This is not the case with \"Dawn of the Dead,\" which is in color and takes place during daylight. The \"zombies\" are people dressed as they normally would, but with their faces painted grey. The result is anything but scary. Tom Savini\u0027s effects are hit and miss, though always disgusting. Nonetheless, this is a decent film that features some above-par acting and a decent script. The Anchor Bay Divimax DVD is also noteworthy, with a clean transfer and DTS sound mix. An extra � star for the effort.\n",
    "\nKickboxer came out a year after the highly popular \"Bloodsport\" and like Bloodsport, Kickboxer is no doubt a \"Van Damme classic\".  There are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences, however the acting suffers - worse than Bloodsport in that department.  As for the plot - revenge - go figure.  But we don\u0027t need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie.  Hey, it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action.  Fortunately, Kickboxer delivers it well.  The movie begins with a couple of good fights right away.  About 1/2 of the movie is training sequences, but many are enjoyable to watch.  The final fight is between the villain, Tong Po (played by Michel Qissi) and Kurt Sloane (Van Damme).  Its a rather lenghty fight, about 10 minutes, which is nice.  Above all else, they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on, and yes the result is some blood during the fighting.  Kickboxer is the only martial art movie I know of that used this \"ancient Thai style of fighting\" (with the exception of Kickboxer 2 and a small scene in Ring of Fire).  I really enjoyed this.  I also enjoyed Michel Qissi.  He had maybe one line in the movie, but still succeeded in making Tong Po a great villain, who also will return in the sequal.  Lastly, we can\u0027t forget to mention the Van Damme dance - Napoleon Dynamite would be proud.  Also keep an eye out for Ong Soon Han (main villain in both Bloodsport 2 and Dragon:The Bruce Lee Story), who has a short fight against Tong Po about 1/2 way through the movie\n",
    "\nI have trouble saying how much I enjoyed this movie.  The plot was well worn, but it didn\u0027t feel staid or plodding.  Visually, the movie is simply stunning.  Absolutely some of the best visuals I have seen in years.  The Jim Henson company outdid themselves this time\n",
    "\nMaybe you\u0027ve heard that \"it\u0027s all been done before.\" Gaiman and McKean prove that wrong with this unique movie. It really is something new.\n\nMcKean has worked for years in the comic industry, defining a visual style that works at a visceral level. The style has many ways to look, depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy. Some times McKean\u0027s work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone, other times it\u0027s a pen-scrawl of some horrible fear trying to waken. Disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience. I never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life - well, I was wrong. This movie\u0027s imagery defies easy description. I can only invite you to see it for yourself, and to experience a movie that is truly like no other. The small-screen video makes me regret missingn the big-screen theater experience.\n\nThe sound track generally works well, too, from the surreal drone of Mrs. Bagwell\u0027s Victrola to the nightmare chant of the Jill-in-the-boxes during Helena\u0027s transformation. I\u0027m not normally one to notice, but Mirrormask\u0027s music complements its look flawlessly.\n\nYou didn\u0027t come here for the story: light and dark in conflict, lost mystic artifact, plucky youth, untrustworthy side-kick. The acting doesn\u0027t distinguish itself either, despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes. Stephanie Leonidas does a good job in the Helena role, with a convincing sulky/sultry mix. If you liked the acting in the original Dr. Who series, this will rise to your highest expectations.\n\nThe story isn\u0027t the strength here. You\u0027ll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy.\n\n//wiredweir\n",
    "\nI\u0027m another of those who saw this at Sundance, and all the things I enjoy about Gaiman and McKean\u0027s graphic novels were on display: the quiet humor, the intelligence, the delightful weirdness, the astounding visual vocabulary. Except that in this case, the words are spoken by good actors, and all those visuals get up off their feet and move.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to describe the impact of watching a McKean painting move and talk. There might be those who quibble about the movie looking too \"animated,\" but of course that\u0027s exactly the point: to create a world and make it dance. The end result, visually at least, is like nothing you\u0027ve ever seen before, and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone.\n\nSome of the people I talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull, that they had seen it all before. Well, it\u0027s true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve--a little \"Alice in Wonderland\" here, a little \"Time Bandits\" there, a lot of \"Wizard of Oz\" over here, not to mention a resemblance to Gaiman\u0027s own \"Coraline.\" But I\u0027m just as familiar with those stories as anyone else, and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of \"MirrorrMask\"--after all, it\u0027s what you do with a story that determines its success. And from moment to moment, there was enough innovation and cleverness, enough delight and wonder, to make the movie a positive delight.\n\nWhen the movie came out in theaters I went to see it again, and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog; then a friend of mine tried to show the DVD to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the spider-thingie. (Hey, in \"Wizard of Oz\" the moment when the Witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me--yet it lingered in memory, and when I got older I was drawn back and fell in love with the movie.  That\u0027s how this stuff works.)  \"MirrorMask\" was probably a little too wild to be a full-out commercial success; but I bet it\u0027s going to have a long, long shelf life on DVD as people pull it out to tell their friends \"Wait till you see this.\n",
    "\nI loved this movie. It was very touching and projected a wonderful image. It was a rare find\n",
    "\nExcelente concierto en el castillo Slane en IRLANDA, Bono se entrega a su publico, buen sonido, buenas imagenes, magnificos extras. LO RECOMIENDO DOS HORAS DE U\n",
    "\nMy hat\u0027s off to Sean Penn for having the nerve to take this role, and then really committing to the role, he committed way too much though. His performance is so over the top he would have qualified for the pole vault in the Sydney Olympics merely by forwarding a copy of this DVD to the judges. Dakota Fanning is as precious as ever and I hope she can avoid all the trappings of child stardom that have sapped some of the best child actors of the last 30 years (Todd Bridges, Jill Whelan, Eve Plumb).\n\nI was not put off by all the commercial tie-ins and know that making a movie has a lot of expenses.\n\n",
    "\nI Am Sam is superb to the core.  Excellent performances across the board, and an emotionally involving story.  Sean Penn is believable as someone who is mentally challenged.  This is a veritable tour de force for him.  But not to be upstaged is Dakota Fanning, who plays opposite of Penn and is named Lucy Diamond after the hit Beatles song.  Sean Penn\u0027s character has to fight for custody of Lucy, and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, for free.  She helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor.  All in all, a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness.  One of my favorites\n",
    "\nThis, as you may have already read, was a very intimate little show made to promote Morning View. The live footage is as good as it gets, and the sound is flawless to boot. This DVD really gives you a good idea at how amazing Incubus is live. Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers. Every song is a favorite of mine, and I absolutely love the way Brandon mixed things up on Pardon Me. Plus the little comments Brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch. I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet. The bonus features are splendid as well. If you watched everything this DVD has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably, there\u0027s that much on here. Just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs, Brandon recording Warning (a lot of this song is a capella), and Incubus showing how funny they really are. The original cut of the Wish You Were Here video is also on this, which is pretty humerous.\n\nA few of the best songs on here are Pardon Me, The Warmth, Warning, New Skin, and Nice To Know You. As amazing and funny as the special features are, the standout is really the performance. I can\u0027t find any words that would do this show justice. I guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself\n",
    "\nThis is without a doubt the DVD to own if you wanna see how 5.1 should sound and how digital video should look. If you own an HD TV and have a 5.1 system you must have this. The crowd has been minimalized. Whoever directed this did a fantastic job, you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song. Incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there (Glass, sounds great). This is the best concert DVD out right no\n",
    "\nI have read many reviews of this movie and got tired of the stupid reasons many people have to complain about this movie.  Most comments are so ridiculous, that you can easily tell they might have a deeper reason why to destroy this movie even though they know is good.  Well I hope this comments are read by the right people who are not brainless as many others.  THE MOVIE WAS FULL PACKED WITH ACTION.  THE 2 T-REX\u0027S ATTACKING THE MAN IN THE CAR, IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GREAT SCENES, THE STEGOSAURUS ATTACK, WAS SO GOOD, THE RAPTORS SCENES KEPT ME ATTACHED TO MY SEAT, SCENES ON THE CLIFF WERE SO GOOD, DINOSOURS LOOSED ALL OVER THE ISLAND WAS VERY INTENSE.  T-REX ON THE SAN DIEGO, ONE OF THE FAVORITE SEQUENCES FOR MANY PEOPLE.  MY FAVORITE SEQUENCES WERE ON THE ISLAND THOUGH.  THE MOVIE IS INTENSE AND FULL OF ACTION.  EXCELLENT SEQUEL IF NOT BETTER.  MAYBE SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOT NOTICED BUT ON THIS PAGE YOU CAN FIND THAT THE MOVIE WAS A TOTAL SUCCESS ON THE WHOLE WORLD WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, IT MADE $614 MILLIONS WORLD WIDE.  ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE MOVIE WAS NOMINATE FOR:\n\nOSCAR: Best Effects, Visual Effects\n\nSATURN AWARD:Best Director, Steven Spielberg; Best Fantasy Film; Best Performance by a Younger Actor/Actress, Vanessa Lee Chester; Best Special Effects, Best Supporting Actor, Pete Postlethwaite \n\nBlockbuster Entertainment Award: Favorite Actor - Sci-Fi\nJeff Goldblum; Favorite Actress - Sci-Fi, Julianne Moore \n\nGrammy Awards: Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television\n\nBETWEEN MANY OTHERS, \u0026 3 WONS.  AFTER THIS IS SAID, I\u0027M VERY SURE SPIELBERG IS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS OF THIS SEQUEL.  AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THE MOVIE WAS MADE TO ENTERTAIN AND SATISFY ALL DINOSAURS LOVERS OUT THERE, AND IT DID.  THE IS JUST FORGETTING ONCE AGAIN, HOW TO WATCH A MOVIE, GET DISCONNECTED FROM FIRST PARTS, AND WATCH THE SEQUEL AS IF IT WAS A TOTAL NEW MOVIE, AND VALUE IT FOR WHAT IT IS, AND NOT FOR WAS IS SUPPOSED TO BE, BETTER THAN THE FIRST PART.  SEQUELS ARE NOT MADE TO OVERPASS THE SUCCESS OF THE FIRST PART, THEY\u0027RE MADE TO GIVE YOU MORE, OF WHAT THEY KNOW FOR SURE YOU ENJOY ON THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE TIME ISSUE, WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE FIRST ONE.  GO GET THEM ALL 3 AND WATCH ALL AS IF IT WAS JUST ONE MOVIE, AND THEN THINK, IF IS REALLY BAD.  I KNOW FOR SURE THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, WHO SAW THE MOVIE AROUND THE WORLD, THOUGHT THE SAME I DID: EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "\n\"Hello Vietnam,and greetings!\",says Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk in one scene of this film. It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian\u0027s brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock \u0027n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock \u0027n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian\u0027s stint. \"You oughta stick to playing \u0027normal modes of music\u0027,not wild stuff\",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The \u0027normal modes of music\u0027 refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. \"Would Bob Dylan be out of line?\",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,\"Way,way,way out of line!\". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,\"Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man\u0027s balls.\" Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,\"You suck,eat a bag of s--t!\". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson\u0027s superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant\u0027s abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian\u0027s friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,\"Good morning,Vietnam\",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian\u0027s departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,\"Goodbye,Vietnam\" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who\u0027s the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn\u0027t GMV? Obviously nobody had any ideas,not even Mitch Markowitz who composed the screenplay\n",
    "\nI remember seeing this film when I was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless.  Seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling.  I didn\u0027t know what the name of this movie was and I was looking for it in the video stores.  I stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that I saw 20 years ago, I bought it. After seeing it again, this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago.  Though, by today\u0027s standards, this movie is rather cheap and cheesy, it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling.  This movie is original, having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings, that eats people like birds eat worms.  This movie is a hybrid of Godzilla and slasher flicks.  This is definately B-movie material, but it\u0027s fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories... and that is worth more than the price of admission\n",
    "\nI bought this for my husband, because I knew he liked Seven Samurai. He was delighted with the gift, and I was surprised to find that I really like these movies too. They are entertaining and insightful and a pleasure to watch\n",
    "\nThe greatest show ever to hit T.V. You will never know what happens next on this show and that is one of the many elements that make this show great,It always keeps you guessing and wanting more.C.T.U(Counter Terrorist Unit) and C.T.U operative Jack Bauer(Keifer Sutherland)try and stop terrorist threats all within 24 hours which is in real time. What I like about this show is that Keifer Sutherlands character Jack Bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against C.T.U or the President. Another great aspect of the show is they are not afraid to kill off main characters that you grow to love on the show, so you will never now what is going to happen next which keeps you wanting more. You still reading, stop and go buy the first season right now. Hell, buy all 4 right now thats how good it is\n",
    "\nWhat a splendid teacher is this! A soothing, captivating movie. The students are most endearing.\nI found it interesting that, in the special features interview with the guy who made this movie, he refers to the teacher as \"the teacher\" and not by his name, Georges Lopes. This moviemaker appears to be of the opinion that there are a lot of teachers who could have filled this role as well, or nearly as well. Well let me tell you, he is wrong. This teacher is special. There are not very many teachers as patient and diplomatic and considerate on this entire planet as Georges Lopez\n",
    "\nI really bought this DVD on a whim.  There is no question why this production won an Emmy.  \"One Voice\" the very last song in the concert is worth the price of DVD.  Seriously stunning\n",

    "\nTim Burton\u0027s \"Ed Wood,\" a surreal bio-pic is one of the most entertaining, inspiring, and funny bio-pics I\u0027ve seen. No wonder really since it\u0027s directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio-pic writers Scott Alexander \u0026 Larry Karaszewski (who, after this film, would pen the Larry Flynt bio-pic \"The People Vs. Larry Flynt\" and the Andy Kaufman bio-pic \"Man on the Moon\"). It\u0027s also got an amazing cast of actors, including Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, \u0027Finding Neverland\u0027), Oscar winner Martin Landau (Best Supporting Actor, \u0027Ed Wood\u0027), Sarah Jessica Parker (\u0027Failure to Launch\u0027), Patricia Arquette (\u0027True Romance\u0027), Jeffrey Jones (\u0027Deadwood\u0027), and Oscar nominee Bill Murray\n(Best Actor, \u0027Lost in Translation\u0027). Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr., an aspiring filmmaker who\u0027s down on his luck and lives with his girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Parker). After hearing about a film being made about a transsexual, without a script, Ed pens a script called \"Glen or Glenda.\"\nThe movie is kind of close to Ed\u0027s heart, because Ed likes to dress in woman\u0027s clothes. But he\u0027s not gay. While walking past a shop that sells coffins Ed meets the actor Bela Lugosi (Landau), who played Dracula in the classic Universal film and recruits him to star in the Glen or Glenda film. The movie immediately bombs and is called one of the worst films ever made. Not letting it get him down, Ed goes to work on his next film \"Bride of the Atom.\" After a few more films and meeting a few new people, including wrestler Tor Johnson (George \"The Animal\" Steele), TV personality Vampira (Lisa Marie), and psychic Criswell (Jones); Ed goes on to make his masterpiece \"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\" The latter is the only film I\u0027ve ever seen by Ed Wood. While the movie has been called the worst film ever made, it wasn\u0027t bad. It\u0027s campy and stupid; You can definitely see why it would be considered bad back then, but it was entertaining and fun to watch. Ed Wood was an interesting, and quirky, guy...Which Tim Burton makes perfectly clear here and Depp does a great job bringing Wood to life. Martin Landau gives his finest performance as Bela Lugosi, he disappears behind the persona. He looks and sounds like Lugosi. Another thing I liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in Ed Wood\u0027s life, through his first film to his \"masterpiece.\" We hear the downside of his life through the epilogue. This movie is, in the end, a loving tribute to \"B\" movies that is over-the-top yet perfect. As I said, the movie is very funny. Especially, Landau who gets some of the best lines as Lugosi.

    "\nThis movie sounded stupid when I first heard about it. Who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense? Obviously, Ice Cube could. This movie stars LisaRaye in her film debut as Diana, who is known to the stripping world as Diamond, a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school. While working at a shoe store, she meets Trixie (Adele Givens) and Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson). They convince her into quitting her low-paying job and working at The Player\u0027s Club, a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac). When Diana\u0027s cousin Ebony (Monica Calhoun) comes into town, she tells Diana that she wants to work at the player\u0027s club. Ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of \"using what you\u0027ve got to get what you want\". This movie is a thrill ride and the fight scene towards the end is the best part of the movie. Featured in the movie are Jamix Foxx, A.J. Johnson, and John Amos. The plot is perfect and the script is well written. This movie has to be one of my favorite\n",
    "\n I don\u0027t think so, be it in the jungle, a New York high rise or at sea. Hepburn \u0026 Tracy were great, no argument. But they were so modern \u0026 urbane, not rowdy \u0026 sexy, always fighting like Harlow \u0026 Gable. China Seas is a fine example of this chemistry.  Yeah, \u0026 its a pretty good story too. Gable is Capt. Gaskell, skipper of a passenger/merchant ship running from Hong Kong to Singapore. Harlow is the floozie, Dolly, he had a fling with on shore. The ship is carrying gold. There is a terrific typhoon, \u0026 a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while. They torture the Captain, but he doesn\u0027t reveal where the gold is. Dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman, Wallace  Berry, against the Captain because she is mad at him. She of course changes her mind. The Captain is trying to ditch Dolly \u0026 thinks he\u0027s meant for Lady Sybil, played by Rosalind Russell, an old flame. But he \u0026 Dolly really are in love. Unfortunately the collaborations between Harlow \u0026 Gable was cut short at five movies with Harlow untimely \u0026 early death several years later.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n",

Taebo is awesome for the cardio but when it comes down to muscle tone, this dvd is tops.  The background music and background exercise people are the least of my worries, you have to concentrate on the exercises she does to TONE YOUR BODY!!!  These exercises are an all over workout.  My favorite part is the 20 minute arm workout, my arms never looked so good!!

    "\nI remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her \"bosom friend\".

    "\nMarc Singer is a bloke from England who moved to New York City, saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets, and became friends with them.  They in turn trusted him, accepted him as one of their own, and showed him their secret living quarters.  Deep underground in abandoned train tunnels, the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets.  Intelligent and resourceful, they had hooked up to free electricity and had working TV\u0027s and stoves.\n\nWhat makes this documentary five stars instead of four is the making of documentary.  Only there do you learn that the movie crew WERE the tunnel folks.  Only there do you learn how Singer made this movie with no money, equipment, or knowledge of filmmaking.  This movie took six years from start to finish.  Unfortunately, it was not the financial success its producers hoped for.  But it resonates unbelievably.  \n\nThe deleted scenes are not to be missed, although some are much better than others.  The one where a man talks about how his cousin killed a cat for food, and the scene where two young men talk in X-rated detail about recent sexual activities lent nothing to the film\n",
    "\nAnother reviewer has said that 5 stars are not enough for this film.  I\u0027ll second that opinion.  \n\nIf you have seen the remake with Michael Douglas, pretend you haven\u0027t and watch the way it SHOULD be done.  If you\u0027ve seen neither version of the film, get this one and get ready for anything.  \n\nThis is above all a classically sarcastic farce between two misfits who have amazing chemistry together.  Both Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are marvelous craftsmen, and their combination of silliness and genuine rolicking humor is blended in an almost non-stop pace from beginning to end.  Again (as I\u0027ve said in other of my reviews), minor characters are important.  Ed Begley as the CIA boss adds weight and color to that aspect of the plot, and Richard Libertini as the South American dictator (I\u0027ve never seen him play a sane character) adds another kind of raucous fun.\n\nThis is a comedy for anyone who appreciates true comedy.  And if you meet anybody who has seen the film, just scream, \"Surpentine! Surpentine!\" and watch them fall apart\n",
    "\nThis comedy starring (Martin Short), and (Kurt Russell) is pretty funny. When I first watched it, I wasn\u0027t really impressed with it, but now I find it pretty funny. I think that (Kurt Russell), as Captain Ron was pretty funny. However, it was the antics of (Martin Short), who hires Captain Ron to sail his ship in the Caribbean, that was the funniest character in the film. The story begins when a relative of (Short) dies, leaving him a ship, which is moored at a small Caribbean island. The wife (Mary Kay Place) who is not too pleased at going to the island, decides to go along with this mid-life crises of (Short); on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat.\n\nEnter Captain Ron (Kurt Russell). He is a very strange and quirky fellow, to the uptight and anxious (Martin Short). However, since (Short) knows nearly nothing about boating, he decides to hire Captain Ron on the suggestion and recommendation of the man who is interested in buying the boat. Therefore, Captain Ron, who is not very bright to begin with, leads the family [including Short\u0027s two children] on a cruise through the Caribbean: And he is a very eccentric character. Harmless, but funny. What ensues is a funny interaction between (Short) and (Russell) on their voyage. Including a scene where (Russell) warns (Short) not to stray from one particular islands path, due to Guerilla\u0027s on the island. Which (Short) interpets as Gorilla\u0027s. A very funny scene. Recommended, it is a family watch that your children can enjoy\n",

    "\nIs it a bad thing to see a movie and deem it good by standards different from which you would judge other movies? Let me explain. \nBroken Hearts Club is a good movie. A little corny and certainly more than a little predictable. It doesn\u0027t really do anything new. BUT, for a semi-mainstream gay film, \nit breaks all the rules. \n\nBreeder hunks play femme gay men. There is no one with AIDS in the whole story. There are butch gay men in this movie. And no, none of the gay men has a best friend who is a single, white, straight female. Can you handle it? \n\nThe movie is entertaining. The plot is sweet. The best part of the film is the style in which it is broken up. Ala\u0027 the television show Frasier, the movie is split into sections by definitions flashed on screen to help explain the next scene. The best definition has to do with \u0027meanwhile\u0027. \u0027Meanwhile\u0027 \nbeing the gay term to tell your friend when an attractive male walks by. \n\nAnd the movie itself is filled with \u0027meanwhiles.\u0027 Dean Cain \nlooks especially nice in this film and pulls off the character of a pretty boy with ease. Go figure. John Frasier leaves his comfortable role of an ex-cop on Frasier to be the father-figure of this group of friends and the coach of their softball team. Andrew Keegan is the newbie of the group- recently outed gay man.

    "\nBased on the early-movie cliffhangers he used to watch in theaters, George Lucas created something special: a re-invention of the entire adventure genre. These films waited a long time to make their bow on DVD, much too long for myself, personally. I always loved these films, they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time. Each of the three films is very different from the others. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", the first and best of the three, introduces us to Indiana Jones, perhaps Lucas\u0027s greatest creation. Premiering in 1981, this film was a smash, also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture. Also starring was Karen Allen, perhaps the most even-matched female co-star for Harrisan Ford. It seemed she could give as good she got, and never backed down in any scene. Second was \"The Temple of Doom\", easily the darkest of the three, and the most intensely exciting. This film is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish, and doesn\u0027t really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor. The third film, \"The Last Crusade\", is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor, and has the wonderful Sean Connery to steal every scene he\u0027s in. The interaction between Indy and Mr. Jones is wonderful. If anyone was to ever play Indiana Jones\u0027 father, it was Sean Connery. The forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features, which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves. These films waited far too long to be released to DVD, and I lay the blame squarely on George Lucas. I\u0027ve heard he really didn\u0027t think DVD would take off like it did, that it was just a phase. It\u0027s great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy. As with his \"Star Wars\" trilogy, the Indiana Jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all DVD collections\n",
    "\nI saw this on PBS\u0027 Great Performances.  This documentary is about film genius Akira Kurosawa.  The documentary charts  Akira Kurosawa\u0027s early life in pre-WWII Japan to the end of his life.  Kurosawa brought Japanese cinema to a world wide audience. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Akira Kurosawa fan.  Plus the DVD has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the PBS program and Kurosawa filmography\n",
    "\nDietrich Bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey.  His books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues, but practical issues of the greatest moment.  There is a great line in Kierkegaard, in the preface to THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH, where he writes:  \"Everything essentially Christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed; even if only medical experts understand it, it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person.\"  What gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them, as he struggled to live out the implications of Christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so.\n\nBonhoeffer was in so many ways a paradox and the documentary does a great job of showing this.  Raised in a secular home, he inexplicably decided to become a theologian and pastor.  At a time when a host of right wing movements were overtaking Germany, he espoused left wing political and social values.  In an age of growing intolerance, he expressed a sympathy and understanding of both Jews and blacks almost unprecedented in the Germany of his time.  And in an age when many theologians wrote academic works with little regard to how they should connect with real life, Bonhoeffer was obsessed with the connections between thought and practice.  \n\nWhat is most impressive in studying the life of Bonhoeffer, whether through reading his books or Eberhard Bethge\u0027s great biography or watching this documentary is the man\u0027s fundamental goodness and dedication to doing what is right.  If he had been catholic instead of protestant, he would surely by now have been declared a saint.  He seems to have had the saint\u0027s calmness and peacefulness.  One is certain that he slept the sleep of the just.\n\nBonhoeffer was one of the most promising young theologians in Weimar Germany.  Had he lived in more peaceful times he certainly would have written a host of first-rate theological works.  Like his theological mentor, the great Karl Barth, who was himself the greatest theologian between Luther and Calvin and the present, he would have written works that explored the concrete role that religion must play in every day life.  When Hitler rose to power, Bonhoeffer could easily have fled to the United States and taught through the course of the conflict and in fact had an appointment at Union Theological Seminary in New York, which he left to return to Germany.  Moreover, he joined the resistance against Hitler and came to believe that it was his moral and religious duty to aid in the attempt to assassinate him.  After an attempt to kill Hitler through the use of an air pressure bomb placed on a plane failed (for whatever reason it did not detonate as it should have), a host of suspected conspirators were arrested, including Bonhoeffer.  He spent the rest of his life in a Nazi prison, dying at the hands of the Nazis only a few days before the American armies liberated the concentration camp to which he was transferred near the end.\n\nIf one reads his ETHICS one is impressed by sections such as the one on what it means to tell the truth.  Kant had famously argued that if a man that one suspects is angry enough to kill a particular person comes up and asks you where that person is, the moral law demands that you not lie to the would-be murderer (though in Kant\u0027s defense it isn\u0027t clear that we are obligated to tell him where the intended victim is, but merely that we not lie).  For Bonhoeffer the situation is so much more complex.  He knew about many facets of the conspiracy and merely refusing to answer the Gestapo\u0027s questions would have done much to confirm the existence of the conspiracy.  Bonhoeffer was forced to systematically fabricate a tissue of lies that would mislead the Nazis as much as he could while protecting as many people as he could.  This lends a sense of poignancy to his writing on what it means to tell the truth that is almost unbearable.  Reading between the lines, one realizes that Bonhoeffer realized, contra Kant, that \"telling the truth\" might actually entail lying to the best of one\u0027s abilities.  \n\nI had only one tiny complaint with the documentary.  I love Klaus Maria Brandauer as an actor.  He is a powerful and subtle performer, but his voice on the DVD is very hard to understand.  I don\u0027t know if his accent is too thick or if the recording has too much bass to be clear.  I found I could understand only a portion of what he was saying.  \n\nAnyone who is moved by this documentary should certainly look further into Bonhoeffer\u0027s life and thought.  I once was privileged to be part of a group of thirty or so students who had a long conversation with Eberhard Bethge about Bonhoeffer.  Bethge features prominently in the film.  There is no question that if you were to read only one book on Bonhoeffer, his magisterial biography is the place to go.  It is massive, but it is unquestionably worth the effort.  I love Bonhoeffer\u0027s ETHICS, but it might be a tad too academic for the lay reader.  THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP, in which he makes his famous distinction between cheap grace and costly grace, is a wonderful book and can easily be read by someone without a strong theological background.  LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM PRISON, which collects things written from the time of his arrest to the end of his life, is justly celebrated as a classic religious work.  A TESTAMENT TO FREEDOM:  THE ESSENTIAL WRITINGS OF DIETRICH BONHOEFFER is a very fine anthology that collects writings from every period of his life.\n\nI recommend this film as strongly as possible.  To me Bonhoeffer is one of the truly great Christian heroes of the past century, though his courage and sacrifice offers equal inspiration to non-Christians as well\n",
    "\nBonhoeffer was a very informative, very interesting video.  I first decided to watch it at the urge of my pastor.  I watched the portion that PBS showed, and I wanted to see more, so I bought the DVD.  I am glad that I did\n",

    "\nOn hearing that Warner Bros was to issue a set of Busby berkeley films, I ensured my DVD player was rendered region-free and then I waited. It was a dream finally come true.  Having been entranced by Berkeley\u0027s films since childhood I could hardly wait for the box to arrive.  Oh joy! The quality of the DVDs is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed, if some of these extras are not to one\u0027s taste, then fair enough, but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature.  \n\nIt is a shame that the Al Jolson number was removed from the compilation disc because it was not intended to be racially offensive when it was produced, but today\u0027s political correctness lobby inevitably takes its toll.  That said, we are left with a plethora of magnificence from Busby Berkeley which gladdens the heart and which left me euphoric because the quality of the release exceeded my expectations.  Thank you Warner Bros for the TLC you have lavished on this set, and you, dear reader, if you have not experienced the work of this great director before, I urge you please, please consider buying it - I can guarantee you will not be disappointed. This was Hollywood\u0027s Golden Age, so now you have the chance to experience it, PLEASE don\u0027t miss out\n",

    "\nThis is the kind of movie I used to enjoy seeing a couple of times a year and now see, oh, about once every 10 years or so.  An incredibly interesting, odd, provocative movie, that doesn\u0027t insult its audience.  The acting is phenomenal, the script is really interesting, and the characters are not people you\u0027ve seen 1000 times before.

    "\nVideodriome is a movie I\u0027ve been a fan of for years. I use the movie as a test to see if people are REAL movie and horror fans and not just posers.

    "\nYes, I thought the Whoppi disclaimers were absurd (HOW many generations have grown up with these cartoons, and now all of a sudden they\u0027re \"bad\"?) I never saw disclaimers on CBS when I watched these cartoons on Saturday mornings for years and years!!!\n\nBut aside from that, my main gripe is the organization. It would be better if they\u0027d organize these into eras (I\u0027m not as big on the Leon Schlesenger era from the 30s/early 40s as I am on the Fritz-era, and would rather these be organized chronologically. Not that I don\u0027t respect those early shorts for what they were, I just like the later ones better).\n\nRegardless, as long as they keep releasing these I\u0027ll still keep getting them, since Cartoon Network and Nickelodean have completely removed them and decided that the new generation of kids \"don\u0027t have the attention span\" to appreciate them (I beg to differ, my kids LOVE Looney Tunes!), and replace them with garbage full of toilet humor (which, apparently, is OK by the PC police...\n",

    "\nVisconti\u0027s film is significantly different from Mann\u0027s classic story. Aside from the obvious changes (Aschenbach being a composer instead of a writer, etc), there are many subtle touches that deepen the ambiguity of the character. For example: In the book, Aschenbach\u0027s wife is dead, and his daughter is grown up and married away. In the film, his daughter dies in childhood, and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits Venice.\n\nAnother reviewer here called the film \"ambient\"; I would add the word \"poised.\" The camera lingers on scenes for many minutes; observations occur in planes of depth. The acting is often extremely subtle. The young man who plays Tadzio looks as if he is sculpted of alabaster. Compositions, lighting, settings, costumes and makeup are simply exquisite. Imagine if this had been photographed in 65mm!\n\nDEATH IN VENICE probably looks better here than it ever did in theaters. The DVD transfer is superb, based on what appears to be a spotless, pristine source. The wide Panavision aspect ratio is faithfully preserved, anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Sadly, the original monaural soundtrack has not been remixed for stereo; but execept for some occasionally muffled dialog (which may be intentional), it still sounds very good.\n\nThe post-MTV generation will find this film tough going. Don\u0027t buy this if you\u0027re hoping to see police gondolas flip over and explode. :\n",
    "\nI first viewed this film with a friend, in my home.  He and I are both lovers of beautiful music and art.  This film satisfies both categories.

They will never compare to Bob Flanagans true life experience of living beyond the expected life span of a human with CF. This man truly took his illness by the balls and showed the viewer that pain can be an issue that is manipulated in an entirely different way. I found it very interesting how Bob chose to be a slave to the woman he loves rather than a slave to his miserable disease. Those who dare; watch as Bob experiences life through the vice of pain.

A crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs; a good hearted man named Dave who thinks about others, and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance.

So the story goes on from there.  Who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the White House. This dvd  picture was good and clear, the sound was great, and the case was in excellent condition.  If you like warm hearted type movies, then this is the one for you.

It always makes me happy to see love onscreen.\n\nThe side story of a jealous rival geisha constantly hurting our hero was annoying.  There really wasn\u0027t any reason for it.\n\nAnother part of the story I found annoying was the lack of communication between the main characters.  Our hero was giving one man all the signals that she was interested, but she in fact was interested in a different man, who she wasn\u0027t communicating with at all.\n\nI don\u0027t like having to witness problems that make no sense to me.\n\nBut then came that surprise ending, so warm and affectionate.  That was nice\n",
    "\n{My review of THE VILLAGE mentions THE SIXTH SENSE more than it does THE VILLAGE, so here it is.}\n\nI don\u0027t really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I\u0027ll talk about this filmmaker\u0027s first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. \n\nThen, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren\u0027t surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. \n\nMy only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on \"the surprise ending\" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we\u0027d never notice. But I digress. \n\nTHE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. \n\nThat could\u0027ve been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. \n\n(The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I\u0027m going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) \n\n\"The ending.\" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on \"the ending?\" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. \n\nActually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? \n\n\"Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium.\" \n\nThat\u0027s a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I\u0027m not panning this one. I\u0027m glad I saw it. I\u0027ve missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I\u0027ll watch them all. \n \n",
    "\nI have four boys between the ages of 11 and 2.  I ordered seasons 1 \u0026 2 and they love it.  Every night we turn Daniel Boone on before bedtime and we don\u0027t have to worry about our children seeing anything other than a good wholesome show. I hope they put out the next 4 seasons\n",
    "\nI thought this was a wonderful DVD because of the following factors:\n\n*The goal of this Billy Blank\u0027s DVD is to get kids off their feet and exercising.  In this day and age of television, video games, and a joke of physical education in schools, it\u0027s up to parents to stress the importance of regular fitness activity.\n\n*The diversity is great.  The children on this DVD consist of both boys and girls, ages of about 5 to maybe 12 or 13 years old, all sizes from thin to slightly chubby, and different nationalities. \n\n*Billy Blanks is just a very good instructor and you can see why he\u0027s loved by young and old.  He motivates the kids and makes the moves entertaining for them, even throwing in a couple of old dance moves. :-)  Billy Blanks speaks from the heart and you can tell that he honestly wants everyone to be fit.\n\nAs far as the fitness level, I could see kids doing this but it gets a little trickier when you get to the floor exercises if you haven\u0027t exercised in a while.  The good thing about this particular DVD is since it\u0027s geared towards kids, Billy places less emphasis on getting moves perfect, his main focus is to get the kids to realize that exercise is fun.  \n\nOverall, I think this is a great DVD to add to your collection.  It\u0027s something you and your kids can enjoy doing together.\n",
    "\nDenzel Washington plays the legendary Steve Biko in this late-80\u0027s film, while Kevin Kline plays a top journalist who befriends Washington\u0027s character in South Africa. Denzel is my favorite actor, and although he doesn\u0027t get a lot of screen time, this is one of his strongest roles ever(and you know that\u0027s saying a lot). Not only does he nail down the African accent, but he portray\u0027s Biko\u0027s renown concern and persistence.\nThis movie was awesome for the first hour. I could not take my eyes off it! As the inevitable came around this point, the movie turns to Kevin Kline\u0027s character who\u0027s trying to escape South Africa and spread Biko\u0027s story and message. It drags on quite extensively(the movie is over 2 \u0026 1/2 hours) but it still maintains, enough to keep it\u0027s five-star rating in my book. There were some other flaws, like how quickly Kline\u0027s character switched from hostility to befriending Biko. That happened so quickly I couldn\u0027t tell when they actually saw eye-to-eye. The film was beautifully shot, especially for the 1980\u0027s, and I love the scene where Biko is speaking at an outdoor stadium being held up by dozens of supporters. Keep an eye out for Joseph Marcell(Geoffry the butler from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) who has a couple crucial scenes at the end playing a character aptly named \u0027Moses.\u0027\nThe reason this movie was so memorable to me was because it really got me thinking how oppressed black folks have been throughout history. Sure, other movies have depicted this and maybe display this better, but Sh##! To find out how black people were even kicked aside and discriminated against in South Africa was eye-opening! I am beginning to understand their frustration as a race, and even those in America, more and more. Seeing this movie, and being Caucasian myself, you get a sense of why the black brethren distrust the white man or see him as evil, and there\u0027s no propoganda or direct bashing of the white race in this film. Just depiction. I, myself, kind of feel like a jerk for what my race has done over all these years. And believe me, we may think this sh#t\u0027s resolved and straight today, but we got a long ways to go!\nYou really gotta hand it to Denzel. He\u0027s tackled some of the biggest black icons so effortlessly, not only Malcolm X, Reuben Carter, among others, but Steven Biko as well. He may just be an actor, but he must have some strong beliefs in his own race as well to portray legends like these! It would be great to see him start speaking up for his people and directly to his people, a la Bill Cosby. I got this movie off Amazon because I could not find it in stores, but I recommend searching for it yourself or buying it however you can..\n",
    "\nI have heard both Arrau and Richter playing Liszt\u0027s B Minor Sonata and I am afraid I very much prefer the way Yundi Li had played this piece. Perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as Arrau\u0027s technique was always not that impressive.\n\nYundi Li is not just a virtuoso. You are impressed not only by the shattering way he played for the more emotional part of this piece ( when Liszt was supposed to struggle with his other side of character), you will also be impressed by his every subtle nuance for the lyrical part of the music which you seldom hear from others. You will also appreciate all the smooth transitions he made from one theme to another. Will I be able to hear a better and a more logical Liszt\u0027s B Minor Sonata than this?\n\nI believe Yundi Li is capable of very deep feeling when he plays. You seldom find one pianist more deeply immersed in the music during performance than Yundi Li . Music just flow out from his fingers in a most natural way as a result of such deep feeling. I particularly agree with this description of Yundi Li:\n\n\"What distinguishes this uniquely gifted young artist from most of his contemporaries is his ability to put his personal stamp on a work without resorting, even for a single gesture, to eccentricity.\"\n\nAlthough Richter was technically more capable compared with Arrau, I have always found him not expressive enough for pieces that require more rubati. You will be impressed by his technique for some Beethoven Sonata.\n",
    "\nLi is no heavy-weight pianist. Neither is Bunin or even Zimerman. And don\u0027t foeget that Chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all. And judging from the steam and progess Li has made, Lang Lang\u0027s position is certainly under threat. And any viewer who is interested in Li or how Chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this-- here we have to thank Martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the Chopin Competition. Now in his mid-twenties, and musically out of almost nowhere, Li is already a full fledged musician.   \n\nOf course, viewers should not compare him with Arrau\u0027s fine balance between the extreme high and rather low register; or his scales with Richter\u0027s.  This is not fair, for Arrau and Richter are such great artists. Li is already so close to Zimerman now. \n\nFurthermore, what we hear may have more to do with the accoustics of the hall, something which has more to do with the engineers than the performer himself. And I say so because I\u0027m a bit concerned about the quality of the picture of this DVD. It appears to me more like a VCD than DVD production (or somewhere in between): it is slightly below average DG production and the camerawork is also average only. This is obviously not fair to a blossoming career that Li is now having. One star is taken for want of a better production. \n",
    "\nI thought Beavis and Butthead changed America. Their stupidity was a influence of a generation. I, sadly, was not allowed to watch the show when it was on TV (I was a child and in my elementary school years at the time), and because I actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode (just like the duo themselves, they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and I don\u0027t care for music videos), I really love the show. However, like other people who also liked the show, I have to agree with them to release all of the episodes (for goodness sake! I can\u0027t believe they didn\u0027t put in the Customers Suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one I have ever seen when the show was on TV) because we want to see and have all of the episodes, not just 80% of them and never get to see the other ones. I guess this is still recommended but remember, we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back (even if they have a lost episodes collection I don\u0027t care, the people want them and Mike Judge is refusing to give us them!\n",
    "\nThis amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability.  The combination of puppets and live action works really well, David Bowie is wonderful, and, all in all, it\u0027s a great family film.

    "\nThe professional reviewer missed the main point of Jeffrey\u0027s dilemma. He\u0027s not so afraid of getting AIDS; he\u0027s afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it. Most people figure a 50% chance of dying before their spouse; but taking on a person with a known, fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate, poignant situation.\n\nSteve Weber is no gayer than George Bush but he certainly is an enthusiastic kisser. This was the first film I saw Michael Weiss in and he totally had me convinced he was gay. I knew Patrick Stewart isn\u0027t, but his performance is dead on.\n\nOverall, a very funny movie with a big, big heart\n",
    "\nThis movie was alright.  I give it five stars for being artsy, quirky.\nIt makes Gay love look systematically funny, and easily made fun of.  Even people with AIDS deserve a better look at their lives.  I do not have HIV/AIDS but have lost friends over it.  This is a movie for those who either want a good laugh, or a good cry.\nI know of nobody who really acts as these characters do.  I doubt it goes on in New York Citys Manhattan either.\nPurchase this if your just wanting to add to your GLBT VHS, or DVD collection\n",
    "\nThis DVD was more challenging than I thought, but within a few short weeks I can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness.

    "\nEver wonder where Col. Kurtz would\u0027ve ended up if he had survived the end of \"Apocalypse Now\"? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals -- the horror, the horror.\n\nIn light of all the bad press one would really think this is a lousy movie. And I can see WHY some people don\u0027t like it, the main portion of the flick is really INSANE. However, if you\u0027re a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the heavy mood \u0026 insanity of \"Apocalypse Now,\" you\u0027ll probably like it. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s anywhere near as great as \"Apocalypse Now\" but Marlon Brando and the jungle insanity make the comparison inevitable. \n\nWHAT WORKS: The title sequence is great, perhaps one of the best in all of cinema (another Amazon reviewer noted this, so I\u0027m not alone); the soundtrack is phenomenal (\u0027nuff said); the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up is fine (\u0027Hyena\u0027 looks especially horrific); the film possesses an undeniable creative pizzazz (i.e. it\u0027s moody, atmospheric and insane); and Marlon Brando\u0027s 35 minute stint in the film is as captivating as always (you can probably tell I\u0027m a huge Brando fan -- in particular, \"One-Eyed Jacks,\" \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962), \"The Young Lions,\" \"Superman\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" [not \"Redux\"]). \n\nWHAT DOESN\u0027T WORK: The third act of the film is almost total insanity, except for the final ten minutes or so; as a result the story will lose the interest of those who have no appreciation for such artistic flair.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS: I really enjoyed seeing Brando in his old age in this flick; it proves he had his magnetic charm until the end. If you enjoyed Brando as \u0027Kurtz\u0027 in \"Apocalypse Now\" you\u0027ll appeciate him in \"Island;\" in fact, as already noted, Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz in his old age (i.e. nutjob in the jungle).\n\nIf you\u0027re predisposed for such a flick, \"Dr. Moreau\" is weird, but certainly worthwhile.          \n",
    "\nI bought this DVD because it was listed as an IMAX title, but it is also 3D if you buy the special glasses from the manufacturer(regular 3D glasses dont work with this title).

The rides are pretty good and the concept and setting behind each coaster is unique.

    "\nCasts were chosen by the author Hemingway himself. That short comment on this film opening was really the miracle. Particularly Gary Cooper as American dynamiter Roberto and Ingrid Bergman as hapless young girl Maria could happen only through the number of miracles.\n\nSPAIN IN YOUR BACKYARD\nAs the movie opening says shooting took place Sonora Pass in California not in Spain. Isn\u0027t it ironic because Sierra Nevada Mountain Range itself was named by Spanish reminding them of the homeland mountains when they occupied the part of California.\n\nBONDED BY MOVIE DEAL\nAt that time movie actors were strongly tied by contracts and that prevented both Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman from the role Hemingway wanted on the film. To win him the movie company had to pay huge money and Maria took it by accicent. She even cut her own hair to be Maria eventually sacrificing the next movie \nrole. \n\nDELETION OF POLITICAL ASPECT\nThat is why the movie became successful and became a very entertaining one. The movie focus on the love development between Maria and Roberto which was excellently shown though a bit old-fashioned. Bergman\u0027s Maria was so natural and you can see how far she was into the role. But the time provided another politics: American hero fighting against Dictatorship an ally of Nazi and Facists. That worked far better than any of government sponsored war propaganda I suppose.\n\nSUPPORTING ACTORS and ACTRESS\nSupporting actors and actresses did the job quite well particularly I think ANSELMO was well performed. PABLO was also nicely acted particularly Pablo grinning at the scene of falling snow is truly scary reminding me of Jack Torrarence of SHINING.\nPILAR is a bit of letdown but not bad. \n\nTHE ENDING\nI suppect there was alternative version where Roberto could survive but the ending place it quite vague. Old fashioned theatrical ploy. I see why BUTCH CASSIDY and SUNDANCE KID ends the similar way.\n\nTHE BRIDGE\nWhy must an American explode the bridge at THE BRIDGE AT RIVER KWAI? The answer might be here. \n\nREAL AMERICAN DYNAMITER\nHemingway might have probably heard of the story of American dynamiter somewhere and combined his own self to create the hero Robert Jordan. THE GOOD WAR interviews the model of Robert Jordan, Irvin Goff. It is said Maria was created by the image of Ingrid Bergman.\n\nVerdict: Very entertaining movie\nRating: 91 out of 100 The presence of Ingrid Bergman alone contributes 10 point plus.\nRecommended for any of classic movie fans\n",
    "\nI never bought the VHS tape, but when I was notified this would be coming out on DVD, I ordered it. While I\u0027m not an amateur, I am a professional, Eric is a guitarist\u0027s guitarist. Anyone who thinks he don\u0027t need learnin\u0027 is a fool and only famous in his own little world, small as it may be. I\u0027m not that arrogant.\n\nAs Danny Gatton was known as the Humbler, Eric Johnson could rightly be called the Inspiration. What he does is not so much difficult as it is the epitome of finesse and transparency of technique. After viewing this, you will understand what I mean.\n\nI already know much of what Eric teaches in this session, for that is what it is, a private session (much like you might get at GIT), with a master at the top of his craft. But there is always something to learn even after repeated viewings. I even scanned in the booklet that comes with this so I can break the lessons down and blow up the individual charts for more easy reading.\n\nIf you are serious about improving as a player, and if you\u0027re looking to be a real professional, you need to get this, if only to see what true professionalism looks and sounds like. The lessons are clear and focused. And with the booklet and the new ability to slow down the examples, you really can learn to play these things. But don\u0027t expect to sound like Eric (just as those who tried to, but could never sound like Jimi Hendrix).\n\nYou are different and so will always sound different, and that\u0027s a plus. But the techniques and all that are included here are part of a \"must learn\" program you need to create and follow if you want to at least make a good living playing music.\n\nLearn from a master of melody and technique, where technique doesn\u0027t get in the way of the melody, but lives in service to the song -- the way it should be.\n\nI teach, too. And I recommend to any student who wants to grow that they should get this DVD. If you get no other, this would serve whatever style you choose to pursue, ultimately, because there is so much here that can be applied to virtually any style, whether it is Jazz, Country, Blues, Rock or even acoustic (which I wish he would have included a segment on that, my only kvetch)\n",
    "\nSea of Love is certainly a better than average steamy crime thriller, but it didn\u0027t really bowl me over.  Pacino\u0027s very good, of course, and Ellen Barkin more than holds her own against him, but Pacino\u0027s character can become tiresome after a while, and what I regard as a pretty sizeable red herring thrown into your lap midway through the story makes the ending a little less dramatic.  I\u0027m not saying the mystery is predictable - it\u0027s just not that shocking of a surprise.  \n\nFrank Keller (Al Pacino) isn\u0027t exactly Steve McGarrett material when it comes to his career as a detective, mainly because the guy is basically pretty pathetic.  His wife left him for another detective on the force, and he\u0027s not handling that very well - drunken calls in the middle of the night to his ex-wife are not uncommon.  The guy drinks like a fish all day and all night, whether he\u0027s on duty or not, he gets into serious shoving matches with other cops, and he spends more time getting under the skin of his fellow detective (and ex-wife\u0027s new man) than investigating the crime at the scene of the film\u0027s opening murder.   Later on, he gets into a serious relationship with one of the murder suspects, which has to break a lot of rules in the old code of conduct.  About all he gleans from the first murder is the fact that someone plugged a fat naked guy in the back of his head and that the killer was apparently a big fan of the song Sea of Love.  Fortunately for him, a Queens detective (played by John Goodman) working on a similar case teams up with him on a two-man task force to find the mutual killer.  The common thread linking the murders together is the fact that each victim had recently placed a poetic personal ad in the newspaper.  Since no one seems to have bothered looking at any of the evidence too closely, Keller and Detective Sherman (Goodman) decide to place a similar ad in the paper, meet all of the women who respond, get their prints and compare them with those found at the murder scenes, and break the case wide open.\n\nKeller meets Helen (Ellen Barkin) at one of these undercover dates.  She blows him off early on, before she even comes close to leaving a fingerprint on anything.  When they meet accidentally soon thereafter, though, a spark is lit, and the two are lovers before you can say Jack Sprat.  Frank puts his feelings for Helen above his job, thereby leaving Helen hanging out there as a possible murder suspect.  This is where all of the suspense comes in; is she or isn\u0027t she?  The story zigs and zags both ways on the question, leaving the viewer in a measure of doubt until the very end.  The whole thing turns into a weird love story for the most part, with Frank trying to avoid losing Helen even as he sometimes wonders whether she\u0027s the killer he\u0027s looking for.  It is quite suspenseful, largely thanks to Ellen Barkin\u0027s very strong performance.  The ultimate ending\u0027s a little weak, but that takes nothing at all away from the sustained mystery that will command your rapt attention all the way up to that point.  \n\nIt\u0027s not hard to see why the movie was so successful.  It just goes to show what good acting and a reasonably strong script can do for a movie.  There are probably two camps when it comes to the ending, I should note - but it\u0027s not a hate it or love it thing.  Some will not find it all that surprising, while others may feel as if it comes right out of left field.  Either way, Sea of Love is a film that all fans of steamy thrillers can lose themselves in and, at the very least, come out feeling reasonably satisfied\n",

    "\nThere are so many reasons to like \"Wild Things\" it\u0027s easy to call this movie perfect. Although it\u0027s not the best movie ever made (or even in the Top 20 for that matter) it truly is a perfect movie...For what it could\u0027ve been. I borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it, it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity. Well, this movie does have a plot and it\u0027s quite complicated. Some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes, but you can\u0027t argue that this is a damned good movie. Matt Dillon stars as Sam Lombardo, a guidance counselor at Blue Bay High School. Lombardo is a lady\u0027s man, in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he\u0027s done half of Blue Bay. Well, Lombardo has a student named Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards, who i\u0027ve never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie) who seems to be coming onto him; Lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother Sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in Blue Bay. Well, one day Kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash Lombardo\u0027s car for the senior car wash and then we see Kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face. Then, Kelly says Lombardo raped her. Lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer (Bill Murray). Well, then another girl named Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) says Lombardo raped her as well. Another player in the plot is Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon), the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories. Now, this movie is one of those films where you think you know what\u0027s going on and then they throw a wild card. After that, you think you know what\u0027s going on again and then s*it happens. Even when the movie ends, you don\u0027t know the full story until the credit sequence. The sex scenes (the most famous with Denise Richards, Matt Dillon, and Neve Campebell) are quite nice, but surprisingly the movie would be good without them. This is a really great movie and worth the $5 bucks it would cost to buy it. \n",
    "\nFirst off I agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie.  When Denise Richards sees Matt Dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like, \"Is this just a game for the boys, or can anyone play?\" She looks so sweet and hot that it\u0027s hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later.  However she pulls ift off pretty well.  In fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well.  I couldn\u0027t understand why Kevin Bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual, but that was actually pretty good acting....I can\u0027t really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists, but it\u0027s interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing.\n I give it 5 stars because it\u0027s both fun and funny, and of course very hot at times.  Well worth a look...\n",
    "\nThis movie looks simply amazing! The color, texture and detail provided by HD-DVD are superb, this is a showcase title for the format. First a word about my setup, which is nice but far from optimal. The HD-DVD player is connected via HDMI to a Sanyo PL-Z4 projector, with an approximately 140\" picture thrown onto a light beige wall. The room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades. Hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado\u0027s but my family and I thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it.\n\nNow about the title - there are no compression artifacts or mosquito noise to be found anywhere. None. I also bought this title on SD-DVD and have watched on an upscaling DVD player, both on a 57\" crt bigscreen and the projector, and there are a distracting number of the aforementioned artifacts and mosquito noise in both cases. They\u0027re most noticeable on large surface solid colors, of which there are many in this movie. You\u0027ll see them \"dance\" and shimmer on SD-DVD, not so on HD-DVD. \n\nThe colors are bold and bright when appropriate, but what really struck me while watching the title were the drabbish gray scenes such as the snow-covered streets of the town with the factory looming in the background. You can make out more detail, without any obvious edge enhancement problems found in the original SD-DVD version. The lights from the townsfolk dwellings were suffused with a soft glow in this latest version, not a ringed mess.\n\nThe story itself is not necessarily an improvement over the original, rather its told from a slightly different perspective, giving more insight into Willie Wonka\u0027s character, and updating the other kids (Violet, Mike Teavee, etc...) to reflect a newer generation of youngsters. Mike feels a bit weak, he\u0027s portrayed as a videogame crazed violent kid in the sequence that introduces his character, then sort of disappears into the background the rest of the movie. Veruca and Violet by contrast are more prominently featured, and you\u0027ll develop more antipathy towards their characters by their actions throughout the movie. Augustus also suffers a bit but since he\u0027s the first to get ousted from the party, it\u0027s logical that he won\u0027t be as fully developed as a character. His romp through the initial scene whilst in the factory is pretty good however.\n\nOverall I\u0027d give this 5 stars not only as a visual and audible feast for HD-DVD owners, but felt the movie was a great update to the original and stands on its own merits, even in SD-DVD presentation\n",
    "\nAn extraordinary film, The Vanishing, brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the American Northwest.\nThe movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category.\nKiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  \nThe setting, the plot (Jeff\u0027s strong sense of love, devotion, and determination are admirable and commendable, and an example for all to follow!), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!\nIn short, The Vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!\n",
    "\nA great reality show, following a group of working class youths in England getting the chance to become cooks in a top UK restaurant for free.  It\u0027s highly entertaining and well worth the price.  We caught this show when we were visiting Australia and got hooked.  Also check out Jamie\u0027s School Dinners series, available on Amazon UK\n",
    "\nI really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc. I have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length. The movie is about a giant gorilla! It is a fantasy film kids! The original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well. I think the remake is incredible.....is it better than the original? In some ways yes! in some ways no! Thats the way it goes! I still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone\u0027s movie collection! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie.....now if he can pull that off.......;-) \n",
    "\nThe premier American cinematic drama is the western, and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns. This set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot, every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side. There aren\u0027t any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections.\n\nIt\u0027s true that the majority of these are b-films, and some are unintentionally hilarious to view today. There are some definite classics (McClintock, Under California Stars) along with plenty of simply enjoyable films.\n\nJust a note, there are a few mistakes. For example, \"The Santa Fe Trail\" included on this set is *not* the 1930 Richard Arlen version. It\u0027s the 1940s Errol Flynn, Olivia Haviland version - which I personally feel is superior anyway. Also, some films were taken either directly from television (you\u0027ll see a IN STEREO flash across the screen when you play the film) or didn\u0027t transfer very well (slight distortions in video or audio) - but considering the age of these movies and the cheap price tag this is an amazing deal!\n\n",
    "\nThe first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of USMC boot camp I have ever seen, outside of actually being there. I\u0027ve read that R. Lee Emery, who played the senior drill instructor, was initially hired to coach other actors for the role. But he did such a perfect job himself that Stanley Kubrick hired him for the job. If the film had ended after the first half alone, it would have been phenomenal.\n\nThe second half of the film portrays the same boot camp Marines from the first half who are now in Viet Nam. The tone and the setting are much different as the men engage in a number of battle situations, including a fairly gruesome scene with a female sniper. \n\nWhere the first half of this film is almost comical at times, the second half is much more serious and grave. Overall, this is a serious and engaging movie that brilliantly describes military experiences on and off the battlefield\n",
    "\nI enjoyed the movie very much.  Since I love the idea of knights and castles during the middle ages and as Merrick says when men still had honor, I wanted to join them just for the excitement and the chance of a lifetime.  Besides I\u0027m a sap for a great looking guy saving his damsel in distress at all costs, even if it mean\u0027t changing history.  I liked that they portayed Lady Clair as a tough, stand up to the bad guy, do what needed to be done, spy for her brother to win the battle, kinda lady\n",
    "\nThis is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s.  It\u0027s an updated version on an old theme:  Save the young heroine from the evil, blood-sucking vampire.\n\nChris Sarandon (Lifetime Movie Channel staple) has an absolute field day playing the villainous Jerry Dandridge.  Amanda Bearse (\"Married with Children\") plays Amy, the young high school target of Dandridge\u0027s desires.  And William Ragsdale (a Hollywood newcomer at the time) plays Charley, the young hero who does his best to convince others to help him save Amy.\n\nNo one really believes Charley\u0027s rantings that his new neighbor next door is a vampire.  Charley\u0027s geeky best friend (played devilishly well by Stephen Geoffreys) doesn\u0027t believe him; nor does Amy.\n\nDesperate, Charley enlists the help of has-been horror actor and TV host \"Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer.\"  Equally desperate, Vincent takes the job as Charley\u0027s \"savior\" because he was fired as TV host and needs the money.\n\nRoddy McDowall plays Peter Vincent extraordinarily well - first as an actor out to (wink-wink) \"convince\" Charley that Jerry Dandridge is NOT a vampire, and then genuinely terrified when he discovers evidence that Charley\u0027s suspicions are true.\n\nDandridge, upon meeting Amy, sees her unearthly resemblance to a woman he once loved.  He is immediately infatuated with the young girl. \n\nBut first, realizing his secret is out, Dandridge acts quickly to rid himself of the problem of Charley and his pesky friends.\n\nThe special makeup effects in this film are terrific and imaginative.  The script is tightly written and well acted and Tom Holland\u0027s direction makes it work.  (Holland\u0027s other works include \"Child\u0027s Play,\" \"Thinner,\" \"The Temp,\" and \"Thinner\").\n\nThe DVD transfer is sharp and clean.  The disc features both a standard full screen version (4:3) and a widescreen version (2.35:1).  Sound is presented as 2-channel, Dolby Surround.\n\nThe only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer.  Sub-titles are available in several languages:  English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.  The disc is also close-captioned for the hearing impaired.\n\nSpecs:  Running time:  116 mins.\nCopyright 1985 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.\nCopyright 1998 Layout and Design Columbia TriStar Home Vide\n",
    "\nThis DVD kick starts the longest running animated prime-time show ever. The first season was an experiement to the show.

Very crude animation, and not normal voices compared to later seasons. Hey they were an experiment so it wasn\u0027t that bad.\n\nRating: 8.6/1\n",
    "\nThis is one of my favorite movies of all time--having it on DVD so I can select a scene just makes it better.  The only complaint I have is that there are no subtitles available (at far as I can tell)--otherwise it\u0027s great--a faithful rendition of a classic story.  I think Jane Austen would be pleased.\n",

    "\nOk, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo.\nThose represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters.\nThey are the traditional \"Mars\" and \"Venus\" symbols representing masculinity and femininity.\n \nI also understand the last symbol representing \"infinity\", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of \"eternal life\" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity.\n \nBut what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol??? \n\nAre these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values?\n(The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity)\n\nI haven\u0027t seen the movie in years but I don\u0027t remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot.\n\n\nPlease also forward your thoughts to VBoston at aol.com. \n\n",
    "\nThree Stooges meet \u0026quot;Waiting for Godot.\u0026quot;  Lurie, Waits and Benigni turn in great performances.  They\u0027ve been locked up in a Lousiana penitentiary for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Jarmusch gives you each of their sordid lives in turn before throwing them together in a jail cell.  Benigni plays wonderfully off Lurie and Waits, culminating in a hilarious version of \u0026quot;I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice scream.\u0026quot;  Eventually, they find the light at the end of a tunnel, only to have to escape through a swamp.  Jarmusch gives his characters plenty of room, making for many amusing interchanges.  Jarmusch provides deft camera work and his usual wonderful eye for detail to make this his most memorable film\n",
    "\nOkay, how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants?  Unless you were one of the misery causing bee-otches, you didn\u0027t.  This movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena, but takes a good crackshot at the mothers (Kirstie Alley\u0027s character is a real gem!).  It also makes fun of the people in Minnesota.  I see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film, but heard the term \"midwest\" used far more often.  We feel your pain, but I would have laughed had they picked my state (which is very close to MN).  They poke fun at hunters, Lutherans (yes, I\u0027m one), and lutefisk for lunch in high school (I\u0027m also of Norwegian decent).  \n\nThe most fun to be had is the way this movie spoofs how nasty women can be regardless of class warfare, and what lengths some of them will go to just to get their way.  Funny and dead-on like the nailhead beneath a hammer, this movie is a nasty and fun treat for everyone who has ever been treated badly by the so-called local uppercrust.  Enjoy 100 minutes of vengeance, and then go out into the world feeling better about the fact that you\u0027re definitely not alone!\n",
    "\nArt history has always been an interest of mine, and I\u0027m a big fan of other art movies such as \"Girl With a Pearl Earing\" and \"Merchant of Venice.\" So when I found out about Modigliani I was happy to take the time to go watch it. Not only was it worth my time, but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion wasn\u0027t looked fondly on. \n\nEverything about the movie is amazing, from the sets to the acting. I feel this is one of Andy Garcia\u0027s best films in some time, not only is he convincing, but he fits the part of Modigliani better than any other actor could. They focused the movie around his rivalry with Picasso, which I find to be one of the most interesting things about it. You don\u0027t only get an insight into one artist, but many. You see the life the artists were living and the obstacles they had to overcome to get their art out into the world. \n\nModigliani also had a tragic romance with a young catholic girl, who\u0027s father didn\u0027t want her with the struggling painter. The story is the perfect depiction of the religious standards in that time period. \n\nOverall this was a great movie, and I would strongly suggest that you take the time to check it out. You won\u0027t regret it, it\u0027s probably one of the best movies of the year\n",
    "\nI have both Madonna Grimes workouts DVD\u0027s and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts.  It was a great way to start my day, I was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same, but with disapointment comes satisfaction.  The other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts, and learn a workout that I never thought that I would learn and enjoy doing.  Jayna\u0027s bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning,  also great moves you can use for other reasons.    Rania\u0027s upper body is really fun, some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot.  Suhaila workout I am intimidated by. I have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it.  I have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks.  She can contract them one at a time.  Some mornings I get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape. They are really fun. This tape has a bonus YOGA, I had never tried YOGA and this gave me an opportunity to try it.  \nI highly recommeded this DVD/VHS. I love the 10 minute workouts.  With this DVD/VHS there are no excuses you can always find 10 minutes in a day.   \n",

    "\nI just finished watching When Harry Met Sally for probably the tenth time.  It\u0027s been years since I\u0027ve seen it and I enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend.  I couldn\u0027t get over the fact that I still laughed several times, almost as if I\u0027d never seen the movie before.\n\nMy interpretation, after all these years, was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments, infatuation, etc. without stooping to sugary sentiment.  I took Harry and Sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable.  I didn\u0027t see them as somehow representative of \"all men\" or \"all women.\"\n\nThen I watched the extra documentary on the DVD which I had never seen until now.  Big mistake.  My new \"interpretation\" of the film was suddenly cast aside as I remembered that I actually didn\u0027t like this movie as much when it first came out.  \n\nOver time I had grown to accept the fact that I could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved.  What I had forgotten was Billy Crystal\u0027s, Rob Reiner\u0027s (director) and Nora Ephron\u0027s (writer) agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders.  Gag.\n\nThe views of the characters are presented as if they were fact.  Men supposedly always think about sex and can\u0027t be friends with women.  Most if not all women have faked an orgasm.  All men are clueless to the fakery.  And so on.\n\nI can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the Boomer generation and older folks (no one on this film is even close being a member of Gen X) because this does not represent the reality of all humans.  You\u0027ll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to \"prove\" their case.  If they\u0027d interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it - \"No, I won\u0027t fake it.  If he sucks in bed I\u0027m going to tell him.\" And as for men, some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it.\n\nNone of this changes this classic film.  That\u0027s the great thing about art - it\u0027s open to interpretation.  I can watch this film and define it my way - two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love. Otherwise, I\u0027d hate this movie.  But I won\u0027t give Reinder, Ephron et al that much power.  Just because they were narrow minded about gender roles doesn\u0027t mean I have to be about their film.\n\nIf you agree with the characters in the film, by all means, watch the documentary.  But if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters, pass it by.  Don\u0027t let a DVD extra taint your pov\n",
    "\nThe movie was Great!!  But they left a few things out in the movie that were in the book!!  There were more siblings in the book.  But this is still a must see and must read!\n",
    "\nLove the book - couldn\u0027t wait for the movie and was not disappointed!  I have watched it many times, and enjoy it each time.  The story was so involved and the movie just about captured every event, which is why it took two DVDs or 3 CDs (yes I have both) to show the entire story. A great way to spend a cold, winter day\n",
    "\nThis is one of the best photography documentary I have ever seen. I love photojournalism and this is as good as it gets. I love the story narration that this DVD succeeds in. James Nachtwey is the greatest ever to have photographed all the atrocities up close and personal. You can feel the pain, agony and raw human emotion in his photographs. He is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger. It needs guts and commitment to do a job which has constant fear of getting killed.\nI salute you.....James Nachtwey\n\nYou inspire me.\n\n- Uday \n",
    "\nThe seventh season was the season that got me hooked to south park. Specifically episode number 712-all about the mormons. That was the first episode that got me into the show, and I haven\u0027t stopped watching since.  The season list includes the following:\n704-Cancelled \n702-Krazy kripples \n703-Toilet paper \n701-I`m a little bit country \n705-Fat butt and pancake head \n706-Lil`crime stopper \n707-Red man`s greed \n708-South park is guay! \n709-Christian rock hard \n710-Gray dawn \n711-Casa bonita \n712-All about the mormons? \n713-Butt out \n714-Raisins \n715-Its christmas in canada \n\nalso favorites from this season include 701-I\u0027m a little bit country, which has the kids working on a report to present at the Anti-War/Pro-war rallies. I just love cartman\u0027s flashback in time to 1776.   Also, episode 709-Christian hard rock, Cartman and his band Faith +1 make it big in christian music to try and score a platinum album before Kyle does, all over a $20 bet.  Finally, Episode 708-South Park is Guay...What can I say..Crab People...who the heck thinks of Crab People.  \nIn all, this is the season that continues to have me in stitches, and if you can only own one season of southpark, I believe this is the one. I myself have them all, but this is the season I believe stands above the rest.  \n",
    "\nAbsolutely brilliant! If you are a South Park fan, this has got to be added to your collection. Matt and Trey have lost none of their wit and I can\u0027t wait until the eigth season is released!

    "\nI owned this movie in full screen on VHS. The quality of the transfer of \"Apollo 13\" with the wide screen and the incredible clearity 0f HD that was never possible before, makes this movie a true cinematic experience. One of Tom Hanks\u0027 best movies!. \n\nSince we\u0027re revewing here the HD version, I own a new Samsung 61\" HDTV and the Toshiba HD-A1 ($399 from Amazon). An incredible improvement over my 1998 60\" Standard Sony TV. If you have the right setup, it is the true home theater dream that we all hoped for since the dawn of home video back in the late 70\u0027s or early 80\u0027s. Be sure you use the HDMI cable or at least component connection. \n\nThe audio track is also Great! With the right Dolby Digital/Plus 5.1 receiver/Speaker/Placement.\n\nAlso, lots of Extras on the NTSC US version, including interviews with Hanks and some of the real astronauts\n",

    "\nThis movie is a real departure for the director, Akira Kurosawa, in that it blends his humanistic inspirational-type movies, like \"Ikiru\" with a bit of action and drama \"Yojimbo, Sanjuro.\"  The majority of the movie follows a young and arrogant doctor forced to work in a rural and poor region of Japan under a domineering senior doctor.  Naturally, everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour.  Midway through the movie, out of nowhere, one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission.  It is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief, confusing, and brutal.  Toshiro Mifune and Kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director\u0027s work changed radically.  Still good, but I\u0027ll always prefer the b\u0026w epics the two of them made together.\n",
    "\nAhh remincing about the old days of youth. This DVD is great for the young and the old w/ comedy that surpasses all generation. Its a great gift\n",
    "\nI bought this only because i loved the first one, hoping it wasn\u0027t as terrible as the second. After i watched it i was so impressed. First of all i loved that it really didn\u0027t have anything to do with the first, aside from Cassidy being Katherine\u0027s cousin,and sharing the same last name (there is only one reference to Katherine and Sebastian in the beginning). It is much better than having different actors playing old characters, which drags a movie down alot. I thought the story was great,  with good twists.The whole cast is very attractive, which can\u0027t hurt either. The \"bad\" characters are all pretty likeable, aside from one, and all is well in the end. The best thing about this movie is the character Cassidy. I sarted out hating her, and ended up really liking her for her realness, and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b*tch.  This actress does a particularly good job, pulling off both loveable, and complete brat at the same time.  I would definetly reccomend this movie.\n",
    "\nGoal! is a well-done soccer version of the road to glory in athletics.  It is a true Cinderella story that makes the impossible possible and fulfills the one in a million shot at stardom.  \n\nThe soccer player, a young hispanic man in Los Angeles, gets a one-time chance to tryout for English Premier League power Newcastle.  As the movie progresses, more and more people believe in the young man\u0027s dream.\n\nHis family relationships are present and well-developed in the movie as is a budding romance.  We see the young player learn about the consequences of his decisions.  There are enough conflicts and challenges in this movie that keep it interesting.\n\nThe soccer presented in the movie is very well-done. We see actual professional players make cameo\u0027s on and off the pitch..no headbutts, though.  A few times I felt like I was watching an actual English Premier League game...there are just a few too many spin moves over the ball but they look cool.\n\nThis is a good movie with a good begining and good ending. I am glad I watched it and recommend it especially to soccer fans\n",
    "\nI can\u0027t believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars.  I don\u0027t know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews, but this is certainly NOT a bad movie.  I was in 7th grade when it came out and I remember how popular it was back then.  Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE loved it.  No one said they didn\u0027t like it.  Even my dad to this day says he wouldn\u0027t mind watching the movie a few more times, and he NEVER wants to watch a movie more than two times.  \n\nThe actors, the direction, the story EVERYTHING about this movie worked.  It\u0027s a movie that will remain a classic forever.  There\u0027s something here for everyone. \n",
    "\nThis movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out.  An excellent and energetic movie from the start. Plot is cutesy.  It serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences.  However, I think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes?  I would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me.\n\nIf memory serves me, didn\u0027t Alex receive a letter from her friend, Hannah, when Alex discovered Hannah passed away?  Isn\u0027t there a reconnection at the end between Mickey and Alex\u0027s (girl)friend whom the latter was dating?  Wasn\u0027t there more of a story build-up between Alex and her boss?  If this version is cut in anyway, I prefer getting the complete and unedited version.  I find this version incomplete somehow.\n\nBut Jennifer Beals looks terrific and one wonders why she didn\u0027t star in more movies for her generation\n",
    "\nNow, THIS is a rock n\u0027 roll show from Rock\u0027s \"good guys\". Pearl Jam is probably the most important band ever in American music. They are to the US what Led Zeppelin was to Britain. This concert is a fantastic representation of their mature post-millenium shows. No, you won\u0027t see a lot of crowd-surfing or moshing any more from these 30 and 40 somethings, just a LOT of great music, and wonderful lyrics. Mike McCready is quite possibly one of the world\u0027s most underrated, soulful guitarists, and his playing just sounds even better when you can see what those fingers are doing. At first, I was not a fan of adding Boom Gaspar to the shows, but I have come to quite enjoy his contributions and pretty much consider him a bona fide member of the band, as I do Matt Cameron, who filled in a \"revolving throne\" back when Jack Irons left due to back problems after \"Yield\".\n\nThere are some true gems on this recording, and the concert goes on and on with LOTS of music and a nice long encore. The crowd is in the thing from the beginning, and the band is \"on\" and every member is in their \u0027zone\u0027, and seems to be having a fantastic time...only Cameron, true to form, seems a bit \"stoic\". Highlights of this DVD are \"Lukin\", \"Black\", \"Thumbing my Way\", \"Last Exit\", and \"Save You\"; however, the band just goes to a heavenly plane with \"Low light\", \"Faithful\", and \"In My Tree\". There ain\u0027t much from versus and 10 on this one, with the band more oriented towards their more \"organic\", \"laid-back\", and \"vibey\" post-Vitalogy feel, which has turned off some of the \"hard rocking\" PJ fans; however, if you listen back, PJ has always had the pensive, laid back rockers, even in the explosive days of the early 90\u0027s with songs like \"Black\", \"Daughter\", \"Alive\", \"Oceans\" and the like. Just because the band has chosen to explore other instruments and rhythms and to mature as a complete organism has caused some to reject them because they don\u0027t rock \"hard enough\"...\n\nAnd that is ridiculous, as one will see on these DVD\u0027s. This is the best representation of PJ\u0027s wonderful live shows on \"official\" record. Ben Harper makes a wonderful appearance or two, as does Tony Barber, the Bass player for the Buzzcocks, who is forever immortalized on DVD for not knowing the bassline for \"Sonic Reducer\"...\n\nOverall, the performance is just about as tight as a live performance gets, and the camera angles and picture quality is pretty good most of the time. The extras are good, but Ed\u0027s solo guitar version of \"Dead Man\" stands out as a heartfelt, amazing performance. \"Down\", an underrated song from the B-side record, \"LOst Dogs\", is merely a backdrop for some behind-the-scenes footage, which is fine, but I\u0027d much rather HEAR what the boys are saying, and see a LIVE performance of the song...\n\nIf you\u0027re a fan of Rock and Roll or Pearl Jam, you already own this DVD. If you\u0027re just now waking up from your coma, then get this NOW! Study it, learn the methods of PJ, and you, too, can become the best band in America! Ex-Frat Boys who only know \"Even Flow\" and \"Alive\" need not apply..\n",
    "\nWonderful show, fun episodes, great actors. DVD Boxset comes with confidentials with behind the scene footage. However, the confidentials are shortened versions from the full confidentials shown on television. But only footage of the old series of Doctor Who was removed.\n\nWorth the money\n",

    "\nThis is a fascinating look at the journey through the first 5 books of the bible.  It\u0027s a visual foundation for stories that all three major religions, the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims, hold sacred to their faith and their traditions.  As a documentary, the journey takes place \"today\" in the midst of the modern-day struggles and misunderstandings that make it realistic and thought-provoking for our faith today.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, this is an amazing way to see the stories that most people of the world hold as sacred to their beliefs and faith\n",
    "\nI love Sandra Bullock movies.  In this movie she is so innocent and falls in love with a man she has never spoken to but saves his life on the CTA.  In the time that he is still in a coma his family, thinking she is their son\u0027s fiancee, fall in love with her.  She inadvertantly falls in love with his brother.  I jus love the Cinderella story line.  She is fantastic as well as the family and especially Bill Pullman\n",
    "\nWhile Roman Polanski was avoiding authories in America in 1988, he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller.  It stars Harrison Ford in a rather unique role; that of a doctor, an every man type such as Jimmy Stewart in \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" without the Indiana Jones hype.  Although filmed 18 years ago, it seems more contemporary that ever.  A fine thriller that even Hitch would approve!\n\nWhat is NOT contemporary is the fact that we consumers here in Region 1 - North America, that\u0027s right, Canada too, get nothing but JUNK \u0026 GARBAGE from the releasing studios.  Lousy, grainy transfers in the edited Pan \u0026 Scan format; not fit for anything but a 7\" DVD personal viewer, MAYBE!  Why is this and most any other post-1953 movie presented in it\u0027s original aspect ratio available in Region 2 - Europe but not on this side of the pond?  Disney is by far the major offender in this area but hey, what say you Warner Bros.?\n\nIt was always thought that the mighty oceans would protect us from our enemies, both foreign and domestic.  9/11 proved that wrong, and I guess nobody though of Hollywood as a band of American Home Video terrorists, a silly statement but ever so true!  This Region 1 DVD release of \"Frantic\" says it all\n",

    "\nThe Replicant proves that Van Damme can really act.  He again portrays two people as in Double Impact.  He is both a villan and his DNA duplicate...hence \"Replicant\".  Van Damme displays a great range of emotions as the Replicant like a child discovering the world.  As the villan he\u0027s truly psycho.  The feds make the Replicant of this serial killer called the Torch in hopes of learning how to catch him.  The story line will keep you watching, in suspense and guessing.

    "\nAfter much debate, I decided to view this film with an open mind.  The performances are outstanding.  I really liked the music composition, as it flowed gently with the story.   In a way, I\u0027m glad this film didnt\u0027t win \"Best Picture\".  For one reason.  The on-location scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch.  Maybe its too perfect.  Later on, We find out it\u0027s not Wyoming, but it Alberta, Canada.  Take a star away!   Overall, this is a movie that will advance gay right in the United States.

(robbery and sexual nature in parts)\n",
    "\nThe documentary was really, really good.  They left some stuff out of it, of course, but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense.  One thing I did not remember was the prodigious mullet Brian sported back in the day.  Man, I think that thing was more impressive than Jagr\u0027s Cup-winning mullet of the early-90s!\n \nI don\u0027t know that I learned anything new from the documentary, but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing.  Also, Stone Cold talking about the Hollywood Blonds tag team was great fun. \n \nThey really played up the Flyin\u0027 Brian stuff as being ahead of it\u0027s time (which it was) and the Loose Cannon character that had everyone guessing.  Funny thing is that the whole Loose Cannon thing wasn\u0027t really long-lasting if you think about it.  The gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his Humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill.\n \nThe accident was glossed over--he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend\u0027s face in his rearview mirror when he crashed--but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not.  He knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him.\n \nAnyhoo, the official coroner\u0027s report was that he had a heart attack; just as his dad had at a young age. Of course, the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over.  I mean, the WWE is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a (ahem) \"sports entertainer\" is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job.  It\u0027s the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale.  The truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him, he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in.\n \nBest parts were reliving the Hollywood Blonds stuff.  I remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and Steve were going to be huge stars.  Steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in WCW.  They never name the booker but I am 90% sure that it was Ric Flair back then who headed the booking committee.  I am also 80% sure that Arn was on the committee too.  They must have felt threatened by the Flare For The Old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a TBS special in (I am guessing) 1992 or 1993.  Great stuff though; and Brian came up with the whole gimmick.  They were so hilarious together.\n \nAnother great part was Jim Ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to Brian in the WWF.  That was sad stuff.  JR really had a hard time trying to help Brian but Pillman only saw the fact that JR order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal.\n \nOverall, I am going with 4 crutches out of 5.  I haven\u0027t watched any of the matches as yet but I am less interested in that kind of thing than I am the documentaries.\n",

There\u0027s no need to buy any additional DVDs! And days that I don\u0027t have time to fit in a whole workout, it also gives you time ranges to choose from.

The extras are fabulous and couldn\u0027t be better. So pick up a copy of this movie toda\n",
    "\n   Pretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition) has to be considered one of the most classical,romantic comedies made throughout the years. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are excellent actors together and without them I don\u0027t believe the movie would have been the same. This classic \"fairy tale\" movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest. This is not your typical romantic movie and I believe that is why so many people love this movie. Pretty Woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there.\n\n      The 15th Anniversary Special Edition also brought some never-before-seen scenes, deleted scenes, and commentary. The deleted scenes are also a must watch, they are just simply hilarious, and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies, but who also likes added comedy as well. Pretty Woman is definitely one of the greatest films ever made.\n",

    "\nOver the years, people have grown tired of natural disaster movies.  Why?  Because they all appear to be the same.  Here\u0027s an example of a typical storyline- everything starts out nice and calm, the story focuses on one family, the family starts having problems and they split up, and then a volcano, tornado, hurricane, or whatever hits, and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger JUST so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie.  \n\nWell, that kind of typical storyline isn\u0027t featured here.  Twister is truly a classic.  It\u0027s not ordinary, either.  It\u0027s about a group of tornado chasers who, as you guessed, drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get never-before-seen film of a twister, up close and personal.  \n\nThis means the film delivers the most amazing action I have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie.  Twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films, and I remember in 1996 how influential this movie was.  I was in 9th grade, and the science teacher played Twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was SO good and much better than other tornado films.  \n\nHelen Hunt plays a magnificent role.  She is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she\u0027s going through.  What\u0027s great about this is that, despite giving us a really good story about a divorce, this doesn\u0027t interfere with all the tornado action.  There are *so* many good scenes in Twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it\u0027s simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie.\n\nFavorite scenes?  Well, everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air, so I won\u0027t pick that one.  I really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater, tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it.  That\u0027s just one of MANY awesome scenes.  \n\nThe storyline is really good too.  It\u0027s not just a story about a divorce between Helen and her husband.  There\u0027s a lot more to it than that.  It\u0027s complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action (against her will).  \n\nThis is such an awesome movie.  I highly recommend it.  Tornado movies don\u0027t GET any better than this.  Pure action from beginning to end.  You will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger.  Twister will make you think twice if you\u0027re thinking about becoming a tornado chaser. \n",
    "\nPersonally, I really enjoyed Premonition. It\u0027s got solid acting, a fascinating (and often heart-wrenching) story, and some decent scares.  However, don\u0027t expect an all out fright fest or you\u0027ll be sorely disappointed. This is a story-driven film, with a plot that progresses fairly slowly. Patience is necessary when viewing Premonition, as is a willingness to accept ambiguity and dream-like logic in a film. But for those of you who possess those qualities, and are looking for something a little different (particularly if you\u0027re a fan of the genre), Premonition might be for you\n",
    "\nThis movie is fantastic! It is defo on my fav list. One of the best!\n",
    "\nSetting \u0026 Theme(s): Castlerock, smallville, summer friends\u0027 adventure, life\u0027s lessons, solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown.  \n\nThis 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner\u0027s directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film.  The musical score is dramatic, it sets the tempo from start to finish, and it never misses a beat; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie\u0027s unfolding, and you don\u0027t forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding.  The lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient, lazy summer days of grandeur, to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity.  One can in Stand By Me favorably assume to watch: pie eating contests, leeches, trains, train dodging, mail ball, fancy cars, fancy footwork (i.e. Verno\u0027s beloved comb\u0027s freefall), cantenes (thought they disappeared w/ Ben Franklin\u0027s outlets), junkyard dog chases, and much much more.  The ending is the real gravy.  The narration is superb also.  \n\nBy far one of the favorite films of my youth.  Believe John Cusack can be seen playing the role of Gordy\u0027s football star elder brother?  Stand By Me is the childhood that big city life just doesn\u0027t afford, at least not anymore.  Everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses; rustic destination spots, like the ones presented in this movie, are still out there folks.  With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure, which will take your there, the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated.  Although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors. \n\nFive stars for Reiners finest photoplay.     \n",

    "\nHalf Light is a movie my wife would like, if I can convince her that it\u0027s not too scary for her.  She is the most timid of movie goers, and refuses to watch horror movies with me.  But Half Light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense:  there are some scares, but at the most tepid edge of today\u0027s horror.  The movie is much more about the grief of a mother (have the Kleenex box close by), and has a big love story (with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse; ugh) in the middle of it.  Just the kind of thing my wife might like, when she\u0027s willing to see something on her scary side.  Unfortunately for me, this is not my kind of movie at all.  \n\nEven so, it was well made.

    "\nCSI:Miami, having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons, reaches its high point in Season 3. Anyone who has watched the show realizes that Horatio, unlike Gil Grissom or Mac Taylor, is the true star of the show. The rest of the CSIs are entertaining, but the show is truly about him. This dynamic, when combined with the glamour and glitz of the Miami setting and crimes most foul, make this for me the CSI that is above the rest.\n\nPlotwise, season 3 is bit over the top. Issues covered in this season include a stalker murder, a sports star on trial for his wife\u0027s murder, a young woman killed in a club, the murder of a uniformed cop, gang warfare in a hospital, the killings of IRS agents, speed dating that ends in a death, spree killing, and the murder of a wingwoman. Some of the lesser episodes involve our old friend Clavo Cruz, a giant boa contricter that eats a woman, skaters and gamers, and of course, the infamous tsunami episode. The season incorporates the Raymond Caine subplot heavily in the last 5 or 6 episodes. This leads up to a satisfying conclusion in the season finale.\n\nThe season is also one of change. A regular cast member gets killed in episode 1, which quite frankly, was quite a relief since the character was terrible. Another regular, not a CSI, kills himself. A new cast member joins, Officer Ryan Wolfe, makes the transfer from patrol to CSI, and making some waves in the process. Callie and Delco (who has very little to do this season) have a tough time dealing with tragedy, and we actually see Horatio dating a rather attractive Assistant DA, at least for a few episodes. Some old familiars pop by, including Suzy and Madison, and Raymond Caine\u0027s killer Bob, who ends up being much more important in the story than we assumed. All in all it adds up to a great season, which will be extremely difficult to top in Season 4.\n\nPeople either love or hate this show, so if you count yourself among the fans, this is a must addition to the collection.\n\nA.G.

    "\nDustin Hoffman, arguably one of the most popular actors of the 1980s and 90s, is in top form here -- but this time as a woman.  Sure, there have been other films with similar setups -- \"Victor/Victoria\" with Julie Andrews and \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" with Robin Williams, to name just two.  Andrews, however, isn\u0027t believable as a man, and while Williams is exceptional in \"Doubtfire,\" that movie seems to lose its \"edge\" near the end.  In \"Tootsie,\" Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, and Dabney Coleman all provide laudable -- even outstanding -- performances.  Lange won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and Garr was nominated in that category.  Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor, Sidney Pollack for Best Director, and the film for Best Picture.  Why didn\u0027t it win any of those three?  One word -- \"Gandhi.\"  Nevertheless, \"Tootsie\" looks as though it were fun to make, and it is certainly fun to watch.  This is an absolute must for Dustin Hoffman fans\n",
    "\n\"Eye of the Killer\" is an excellent small movie.  Kiefer Sutherland is police detective Mickey Hayden in a self-destructive mode since the breakup of his marriage.  He chases an albino wino who runs out of a convenience store with his Jack Daniels into a vacant warehouse.  Hayden falls through a second-story floor and hits his head which starts him receiving psychic visions of the victims through the eyes of the killer.  He meets a parapsychologist, Dr. Vera Swann, played by Polly Walker.  Romantic sparks eventually fly between the two, allowing Hayden to start to get over his divorce.  He lost his wife to police detective John Hatter played by Gary Hudson who seems to meddle in the investigation, eventually pointing toward his guilt.  Henry Czerny who was the thief opposite Harrison Ford in \"Clear \u0026 Present Danger\" and has done \"Pink Panther\" and \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" plays Harvey, a psychic that attaches himself to Mickey Hayden in a gay bar.  Hayden frequents the gay bar because it\u0027s a place for a straight guy to be alone.  With his partner Ray Coombs played by Ronn Sarosiak, they seek to find the serial killer supposedly responsible for a string of murders.  All of the murders eventually are solved and improbably point at the owner of a newspaper who was trying to capitalize on the Jabberwocky serial case to heighten the value of her newspaper so it could be profitably sold.  Loren Petersen plays the hapless Alice who we see fall down the stairs several times and get her skull smashed.  This little drama that was originally an HBO movie works pretty well as a nouveau film noir.  Enjoy! \n",
    "\nThis dvd is awesome. It covers Michaels disco years through the 1990s. \"Beat it\" and \"Billie Jean\" are timeless videos and show you Michael Jackson at his creative zenith. This dvd also includes the full length videos of \"Bad\" and \"Thriller\" Lets not forget \"Remember the time\" with its amazing dance moves and catchy rythem. This dvd compilation makes you see why Michael Jackson will always be the king of pop. I like this dvd out of all of Michael Jacksons dvd releases. \"Dont stop till you get enough\" and \"Rock with you\" may be simple videos but I watch both videos and see an innocence in Michael before the Thriller phenomenon. This is the best of Michael Jackson. Sony dvd has done an incredible job on the sound quality of this Michael Jackson dvd. The sound quality on a regular television or theatre system will amaze you\n",

    "\n\n   With present day footage masterfully juxtiposed with much,heretofore unseen,period film, this multi-disc history of the Great War breathes life into the first quarter of the twentieth century unlike an i\u0027ve seen thus far. We are shown how the echoes of events that occured nearly a century ago still resonate with deafening clarity in our twenty-first century lives. The mistakes which plunged the world into a decades long bloodbath are laid out in a way that describes, in riveting detail, the follies and grave consequenses of cavalier militarism. This series is neither dry or pedantic but illumunates facts with which everyone should be acquainted. Perhaps we can avoid a repetition of this debacle\n",
    "\nRarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence, teenage angst, sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from Alexander Payne.  Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range.  Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon\u0027s often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality.  In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty.  One of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election.  Reese prays to an unfamiliar God and beseeches him to let her win so she \"can carry out his divine plan.\"  Campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the Catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to, while goofy Klein shows the most depth by thanking God for all of his blessings (especially his large penis) and telling God he knows the best candidate will win.  \nELECTION is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind.  Enjoy\n",
    "\nThe film shows us the reality that is Wal-Mart, many common criticisms, and many common misconceptions.  It successfully shows that all of the criticisms against Wal-Mart are outright lies, half-truths, distortions of facts, or just plain ideological hatred for a successful business.  It shows what the employees go through while on the job and off the job.  It also shows how Wal-Mart has actually increased America\u0027s standard-of-living by allowing the poorest of us to purchase our daily necessities at the lowest price possible and the least-skilled amongst us able to attain high-quality health benefits and a decent wage.\n\nWal-Mart is not a perfect business, and it never will be.  No business is perfect.  Unfortunately, many people do not ever cope with this fact, and don\u0027t seem capable of it.  They compare Wal-Mart to the \"perfect\" business which does not exist, and then have the audacity to complain when Wal-Mart does not fit their non-existant model of perfection\n",
    "\nOn December 14, 1944, as American troops under General Douglas MacArthur slowly advanced toward the island of Luzon, Japanese guards at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on Palawan committed a terrible act. Herding their Allied war prisoners into trenches, they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive.\n\nUtah native Eugene Nielsen, private first class in the 59th Coast Artillery, was one of the few who escaped. Filipino guerrillas transported the survivors to the island of Morotai, where Nielsen described his experience to an Army intelligence officer. News of the massacre reached the POWs at Cabanatuan, as well, and prompted the U.S. Army to embark on one of the war\u0027s most dramatic missions -- the Bataan\n\n",

    "\nA short workout that packs a punch and will whip you up in shape!\nIf you like endurance weight training with short cardio bursts then you will enjoy these workouts! I have all 4 of Jillian\u0027s endurance strength training DVDS and they are very good especially when combined with 30-45 mins. cardio. The Maximize Full Frontal DVD is a little more intense than Jillian\u0027s Shape Up Front DVD; it has more core work, more one-leg moves and the cardio segments always use dumbbells. The Maximize Back In Action DVD is also a little more intense than Jillian\u0027s Shape Up Backside DVD; it has more core work, harder exercises and additional power moves. All 4 DVDs are an excellent buy and since they are all short workouts, you can easily combine them with cardio for a well-rounded 60 minute workout. Note: You will not like Jillian\u0027s workouts if you prefer to go heavy with weights.\n",
    "\n\"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True\" is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original Cinderella and a few new ones. The animation is amazing --- it\u0027s filled with lush color (except for muted color when the story calls for it) and the animation looks very polished. It\u0027s really a sight to see.\n\nThe three stories in this are called, according to the closing credits --- \"Aim To Please,\" \"Tall Tail\" and \"An Uncommon Romance.\" These stories are all tied together with the idea that the Fairy Godmother is helping the mice to make a storybook about the adventures of them and Cinderella since the time that Cinderella met the Prince. The very first story finds Cinderella arriving at the castle after her honeymoon. The Prince is forced to rush away on important state business and Cinderella is left in charge of the royal banquet/ball. She has no idea what she\u0027s supposed to do and so this woman named Prudence is assigned to help her out. But will Cinderella be able to pull this together in time and in a way that will please the King?\n\nThe second story, \"A Tall Tail\" finds Cinderella in preparation for the Spring Festival. Jaq wants to help out, but it seems like Cinderella no longer has any time for him. He makes a wish to become human.\n\nThe final story contains the surprising premise that Cinderella\u0027s stepsister Anastasia is falling in love with a breadmaker at market. The Evil Stepmother forbids this romance, but Cinderella decides to show Anastasia that even she can have a dream come true.\n\n\nThe voice talent is amazing. They did a great job of casting people who made the voices sound just like the original film. Unless you\u0027re really listening hard, you\u0027ll be hard-put to notice any difference at all.\n\nThe music in this film is a combination of themes from the original and a few new songs performed by Brooke Allison. I\u0027d never heard anything by Brooke Allison before (that I know of), but she\u0027s an amazing artist. Perhaps the most surprising piece is the closing credits number (also featured as a music video) --- a techno version of \"Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo\" called \"Put it Together.\" It works quite well. Another great song is \"Follow Your Heart.\"\n\n\nFor a Disney sequel, this DVD also has some nice special features. There\u0027s the aforementioned music video, which features entirely of clips from the film, rather than the recording session by Brooke Allison. However, you do get to see some of the recording in the Musical Magical Featurette, which also includes an examination of the film\u0027s score by the composer. There\u0027s a Cinderella Storybook, which allows you to read a story about Jaq and Mary with or without narration. The Enchanted Castle game is fairly simple, but not too bad --- you get to help with the decoration and cleanup of Cinderella\u0027s castle, preparing a meal and dressing Cinderella. There\u0027s also a DVD-ROM game called Cinderella\u0027s Dollhouse. Finally, of course, this DVD has the usual previews/trailers for other movies, but perhaps not so usual. This is a great set of trailers. There\u0027s a promo for the \"Beauty and the Beast\" Special Edition DVD in which they talk about how they inserted \"Human Again\" into the film. Also including in this set is a neat Disney DVD \"Pure Digital Magic\" promo that I had never seen before.\n\nThis DVD is truly a worthy edition to the Disney Cinderella story. It really has everything you could want from a sequel to this film and doesn\u0027t ruin the original story in any way\n",

    "\nWhere did this guy come from?  My daughter rented this Eddie Izzard DVD.  I was blind-sided with the sophisticated, mime-style humor of Eddie Izzard (is this his real name?  Is he really a \"he\"?).  From hearing about Genesis to wondering why Noah had to get two of everything... including ducks..., Eddie Izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy.  Nothing was off limits... the Queen Mother, Death, hopscotch, speed archeology, toasters, and Achilles.  It is all here!\n\nTake special note of the set... very minimalist.  Izzard uses his talents to make you \"see\" what he is describing, without depending on props.  From swords to Hoovers, you will get his meaning.\n\nRated R for mild profanity, and I for irreligious\n",
    "\nI was totally taken with this new rendition of the Broadway musical. The only downside is that I\u0027m not much of an Alec Baldwin fan, but..... he did OK! I encourage anyone who enjoys a heartwarming musical to see this one\n",
    "\nWhat I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn\u0027t exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can\u0027t be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is \"I can\u0027t teach him how to be a man, that\u0027s your job.\" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne\u0027s charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, \"I know you think I\u0027m being hard on you Tre, but I\u0027m not. What I\u0027m trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don\u0027t have anyone to do that, your\u0027e gonna see how they end up, too.\" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I\u0027d have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre\u0027s mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how \"real\" Furious was. \"Young\" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it\u0027s success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today. \n",
    "\nA great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a \"ripoff\") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tapes).\n\nThe downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). \n\nThe opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies.\n\nThere is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it\u0027s apparent who the killer is, it\u0027s still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women. \n",
    "\n\"Dr. Strangelove: OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" is one/third of the films that are considered Stanley Kubrick\u0027s masterpieces (the other two are 2001: A Space Odyssey \u0026 A Clockwork Orange).  It\u0027s a satire, released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today. Whenever you look at a list of great movies, it\u0027s on there. It holds a place on The American Film Institute\u0027s Top 100 (#26),\nThe American Film Institute\u0027s Top 100 Comedies (#3), is featured in Roger Ebert\u0027s \"The Great Movies,\" and is just, overall, acknowledged as a fine piece of cinema. The movie opens with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) launching an unauthorized nuclear attack against Russia. The general is clearly mad and believes that the Russians are polluting everyone\u0027s valuable bodily fluids. The only person who can stop Ripper is Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers), a British guy who listens to Ripper\u0027s ranting in disbelief. Meanwhile, at The Pentagon, the President of the United States; President Muffley (Peter Sellers, again) assembles a meeting in the War Room where he is told hesitantly by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) that the bombers can not be recalled, no one can reach Ripper, etc. In one of the most hilarious characters I\u0027ve ever seen portrayed on screen, we meet Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers, yet again) a strategist aiding the people in the War Room. Strangelove\u0027s right hand, covered in a black glove, has a mind of its own...It frequently throws up Nazi salutes and tries to kill Strangelove. Also happening in the story is one of the planes heading to Russia to drop the bomb. The ruler of the cockpit is Major \"King\" Kong (Slim Pickens), a character that was supposed to be played by Sellers but reportedly couldn\u0027t because Sellers had recently suffered a broken angle. The scene where Kong rides a nuclear bomb as if he was riding a bull is one of the scenes in the movie that you\u0027re not likely to forget. Now, this is a funny and important film; But it\u0027s not my favorite Kubrick film, nor is it the most entertaining Kubrick film. But due to it\u0027s significance and the performances (by Sellers, Hayden, and especially Scott) it definitely deserves the term \"masterpiece.\"\n\nENTERTAINMENT: B\nHUMOR: A-\nIMPORTANCE: A\nOVERALL GRADE: A-\n",
    "\nThis black and white masterwork of film is a must see for all.  This is a not just a courtroom movie, but an examination of ourselves and how we see each other. Reginald Rose\u0027s original play reads like a powerhouse, even in a highschool english class, but given the direction of Sidney Lumet, the dynamite cast and the beautifully stark black and white cinematography it becomes a legend on film.\n\nThis movie centers on the diverse jury and it\u0027s deliberations in the murder trial of a young Puerto Rican man accused of killing his own father. It is an examination of our perception of one another, our selfish nature, our apathy when a crisis occurs-but does not affect us and our preconceived ideas of each other NOT based not upon fact, but upon our own experiences and traumas. It sheds light on how we process our decisions and how we can be easily yet unknowingly swayed away from the truth and yet believe we make honest and fair evaluations of fact, when in all truth we do not.\n\nThis was the ONLY film in which Henry Fonda starred AND was the producer and it was slow to take off at the box office. But within a few years this film became an american film mainstay. Regardless of the stunning performances and positive reviews, he never produced again.\n\nThis film has many of the early television and film greats and  each gives a RIVETING PERFORMANCE!!! There\u0027s Jack Klugman, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall and Lee J. Cobb who gives one of the most memorable performances in the film. Cobb, who was known for his moving portrayal of Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman, is aggravating and compelling. Fonda depicts the \"voice of reason\" juror that is neither self-righteous or bleeding-heart wimpy. He challenges the other jurors and the viewer alike to rethink their conclusions and recalculate them by utilizing ALL the facts. Anyone that sees this movie will recognize at least someone they know that is like each juror, which are designated only by number throughout it\u0027s entirety, in their daily lives.\n\nDon\u0027t let the black and white format sway you, this DVD is presented in a lovely widescreen format that intensifies the expert cinematic talents of the golden age of the silver screen. This is considered an essential for anyone that loves film. My thirteen year old actually sat mesmerized through the whole film and began to watch some of my other DVDs (To Kill a Mockingbird, Inherit the Wind, Judgement At Nuremburg, to name a few) and at that tender young age, he is determined to spread the word and keep the tradition of sharing these movies of great distinction..\n\nMetaldiva Sez: This is one of the essential films you should watch and share with your friends and family.  This is an excellent price to own and to share. Get it today....   \n\n",

    "\nI haven\u0027t watched the first season - I just started watching the show so I\u0027m a very brand new viewer - but I\u0027ve seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show.  Its subject matter is grim, yes, but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry, especially David Boreanaz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel) and Emily Deschanel.  The stories are interesting w/out being too scientific so anyone can follow along.  And I never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone\u0027s bones (okay, maybe only in tv land). \n",
    "\n`Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage\u0027 (`Sophie Scholl - The Final Days\u0027) follows the last six days of the life of Sophie Scholl, member of `The White Rose\u0027 small anti-Nazi organization that protested against Hitler through the non-violence method in the war-time Munich. Her life had been filmed in Germany twice before - `The White Rose\u0027 by Michael Verhoeven, and `The Five Last Days\u0027 by Percy Adlon both in 1982. Unfortunately I haven\u0027t seen them, but the fact proves that this anti-war organization during the WWII in Germany, some part of which still remain mystery, has been always a very fascinating topic in that country.\n\nNow, using the unpublished materials that were unavailable then, German director Marc Rothemund made another film based on this important episode in the German history. This time he gives stress to the realistic description of the last six days of Sophie Scholl, a 21-year-old college student who was arrested with her brother during the political activities against the Nazi in 1943.\n\nActually Sophie was only posting and scattering the anti-Hitler fliers in college campus, but that was enough for the Nazi; at first, however, they were not sure. Sophie is just an ordinary student, and the Nazi interrogator Robert Mohr was not convinced.\n\nThe film spends considerable time in depicting the dialogues between Sophie Scholl and Robert Mohr, and the rising tension between two real-life characters, supported by historical material and strong acting, is one of the most impressive parts of the film. Consequently the film becomes a bit talky sometimes, but both Julia Jentsch (`The Edukators\u0027) and Gerald Alexander Held did a fantastic job as two realistic persons with souls, without making them too saintly or monstrous.\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for the facts about The White Rose itself, you may be disappointed. The behaviors of Sophie and Hans, her brother, before their arrest by the police look incredibly reckless, far from that of organized resistance. The film would not tell you much about what the group was really doing before they were caught because it is about the spiritual transformation of Sophie Scholl. I don\u0027t know anything about the historical accuracy of the film, but it is clear that the filmmakers took great care to present the most accurate portrait of Sophie Scholl (see the detailed procedures of the court, for example). Because of that, the film sometimes gets slower than it should be, but still the powerful acting from the actors are as fascinating as this historical event itself.\n\nBut the strongest, or I should say, the most shocking part of the film is waiting for you at the end of the film. One image still haunts my mind, which I can\u0027t tell you of course, but all I can say is, prepare for one sequence that is more unnerving and disturbing any suspense or horror films.\n\nLike `Downfall\u0027 another gripping German film about the Nazi, `Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage\u0027 gives you a realistic image of a human during the war. And this is a heart-wrenching story about one real-life person that lived an extraordinary life.\n",
    "\nTHE INCREDIBLES is a first-class animated film about a superhero and his family who are forced to seek the anonymity of a government witness protection program to escape a rash of lawsuits orchestrated by their enemies. Mr. Incredible has to endure the boredom of a job as an insurance claims specialist while his wife and children cooperate by also concealing their extraordinary powers in front of others.

    "\nWe own three Baby Faith DVD\u0027s.  Our favorite is \"God Made Music\", followed by \"God Made Me\".  \"God Made Animals\", while still a good video, is our least favorite.  For one, the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing (but judge for yourself, I\u0027ve posted some pictures).  The frog was creepy - since when do frogs have lips?  The visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too.  And the undersea clips at the end looked as old as Cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one year-old son, who is entranced by the other two videos but doesn\u0027t seem to care much for this one.

    "\nI\u0027m not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years.

    "\nSeeing/hearing a movie such as this in the German language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic.\n\nFurthermore the actors who play the key roles, especially Hitler, but also Goebbels, Speer, Himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie.\n\nWhat sets the film apart from other WWII/Hitler films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings -- NOT stereotypical Hollywood caricatures.  What makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine.  Furthermore the the director avoids melodrama.  The events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of Berlin.\n\nAs good as Schindler\u0027s List and Saving Private Ryan were, this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and over-acted.\n\nThis is a milestone in WWII genre of film-making\n",
    "\nI became interested in this movie after reading the book \"Ishmael\" by Daniel Quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book. It was a very good movie and Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from \"Ishmael\" there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization. There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - \"takers\" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don\u0027t know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it. Heck, the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees. But of course that was the main point of \"Ishmael\". If we don\u0027t give up being takers and go back to being part of nature, then nature has had it and so have we\n",
    "\nThis is a good cold war drama. After a Soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place, the race is on to recapture the film. As was pointed out in the film, the Soviets used their German scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from England\u0027s German scientists using a special film developed by the US\u0027s German scientists. The film has the location of both side\u0027s missile installations and both sides want it. Neither side will give an inch.\n\nThe chase takes place with a US nuclear sub, overcrowded by marines and spies. The problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission. The twists and turns don\u0027t stop and neither does the excitement.

Her efforts to do so lead her into difficulties.  Her father is supportive but even he must fight the social structure--especially when trying to get her into the male-only art school.  He finally gets her apprenticed to another talented artist and is devastated when he finds they have engaged in an \"unlawful\" relationship.  He files rape charges and everyone suffers.  A brilliant social commentary\n",
    "\nBefore I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it\u0027s not as good as the original. It\u0027s full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can\u0027t help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments.\n\nHowever, the film is a bit uneven. The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his \"negotiation skills,\" he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.\n\nAn impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it\u0027s nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she\u0027s also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn\u0027t in the film for very long. Andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.\n\nF. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn\u0027t handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn\u0027t. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn\u0027t measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that\u0027s it.\n",

    "\nThis BBC miniseries has a well earned reputation as being much looser and freer with its literary souce (here the source material is not just one work but several works of DH Lawrence)than most literary adaptations for English television. Also, while most BBC productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and forward-thinking characters: in this case the sultry and sophisticated, and somewhat libertine (in a 1920\u0027s kind of way), Lady Chatterly \u0026 the earthy and irreverent and smoldering (smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class) Oliver Mellors.  Both of these factors can be attributed to director Ken Russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the BBC\u0027s best programs (many of them about musical composers). Russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking. Of course most of us in the states know Ken Russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as TOMMY (1975), ALTERED STATES (1979),and, GOTHIC (1986); all of which feature lurid dream sequences and, some would say, gratuitously lewd situations. But Ken Russell is actually a director with many facets, and Russell\u0027s interest in DH Lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best DH Lawrence adaptation on film, WOMEN IN LOVE (starring Glenda Jackson, Oliver Reed \u0026 Alan Bates). He then followed that up twenties years later with THE RAINBOW (starring Amanda Donohoe, and Sammie Davis). Both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though Russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books; his additions, however, were tasteful and even added clarity to the material. \n\nWhat is interesting about this new DH Lawrence adaptation is that Ken Russell seems to have remained interested in DH Lawrence for so many years and for many of the same reasons. DH Lawrence more than any other author in the English language, or any language for that matter, stands for the power of the body and the bodies experience over the power of reason. This was the main theme of his earlier DH Lawrence adaptations and this is the main theme of his latest. But this one is by far the most sensual of the three and that is largely due to the fact that Joely Richardson seems to be the very embodiment of sensual awakening; the actress seems as willing as her character to simply follow the dictates of the body regardless of social norms.  Its always a big deal when a high profile actress (especially one with the lineage of Joely Richardson) sheds her clothes on screen, but to do so on British televison for all to see takes more than a little boldness. The nudity is well done and adds to the allure of this BBC classic; no question about that. The greatest scene in the entire 4 hour miniseries is not the nudity, however, but, the vision Joely has before she ever ventures out to that hut in the woods. One night after hearing her blowhard husband, Lord Clifford  (who cares more for his family estate \"Wragby\" and his \"class\" than he does about any individual), read from Socrates about the white horse of reason and the black horse of desire, she dreams she is riding through a Greek temple full of nude men who seem to be growing like vines out of the stone. This is not something that DH Lawrence ever wrote, this is pure Ken Russell and yet its the most exciting thing in the whole miniseries; plus its the best way to deliver Lady Chatterly\u0027s state of mind (or body) to us. DH Lawrence is actually very wordy for one who claims to be interested in the body more than in the mind but Ken Russell has found a visual shorthand for delivering those Lawrentian themes with nice visuals. I only wish there were more moments like this. The most sensual acting is done by Joely Richarson when in her private chambers. And Russell seems to be keenly aware that it is Lady Chatterly\u0027s imagination that fires her body. After the horse dream Connie drapes a veil over her head and walks nude through the house down to Lord Clifford\u0027s first-floor room. This scene is more imaginatively and erotically charged than any of the actual love scenes that will follow.  \n\nThe actual affair between Lady Chatterly and Oliver Mellors is a little odd; in fact its very awkward. At first they just agree (sort of) to use each other for sex. But of course that never works and soon they are intimates thoroughly engaged with each other, body and mind, and running naked through the rainy glades and meadows; then sitting nake dbefore a fire and pretending to be Lady Jane and John Thomas. Their \"understanding\" involves a mutual appreciation of nature, and a mutual loathing of Lord Clifford and the upper-class privileges that he defends as birthrights. Russell gets a lot of mileage out of the Racine and Proust reading and piano and chess playing Lord Clifford and his antagonisms toward all those that he perceives to be lower than himself (pretty much everyone in the coal mining community that he owns; this actor really has fun with this role and Russell obviously enjoys his rants because he gives him so many). Lord Clifford is actually a pretty forward-thinking guy, in his own way, as he does give his wife permission to take a lover, but, arguably, its for selfish reasons: he merely wants an heir. We certainly pity this WWI vet who must cart himself around in various malfunctioning contraptions (metaphors for the mind and its futile tinkerings perhaps; what people are reduced to when they no longer have a functioning body) but he just won\u0027t allow anyone to actually like him except his live-in nurse who finds him curiously attractive (a plot thread that Russell leaves undeveloped). He even vents about the lower classes \"knowing their place\" in the \"natural\" scheme of things right in front of his house servants. Russell lingers on the face of one table servant as he does so (another striking Russell touch). No mistaking whose side this film maker is on. So this affair of the body between Lady Chatterly and Mellors is actually informed by a social awareness and a mutual understanding and empathy (which one could argue is as much about reason as it is about the body). In any event we eventually come to accept that these two opposties are drawn to one another for a variety of social and sexual reasons: the one perhaps fueling the other. \n\nLady Chatterly\u0027s own father and sister are free-living  bohemians; so why exactly she was attracted to the repressed snob Lord Clifford Chatterly is a bit of a mystery. Both her father and sister encourage Connie to find lovers but her sister anyway is as much as a snob as Lord Clifford. We\u0027re not certain and we never hear what her father thinks of her affair with the gamekeeper Mellors so we never know if the affair has had social repercussions for Lady Chatterly herself.  \n\nThe ending is a bit ...well I don\u0027t want to give it away. Suffice it to say that it\u0027s different than the book and it doesn\u0027t quite resolve those class issues that it raised. The answer seems to be: leave England. Perhaps the ending is based on one of Lawrence\u0027s short stories. In any event Ken Russell\u0027s creative attitude toward the \"classics\" is perhaps the most attractive thing about this adaptation. I hope his attitude is contagious and will inspire more loose and free treatments of the classics. This cultural freedom is refreshing and liberating (for mind and body).\n",
    "\nSure, I could have compared Phantom Quest Corp. to a lot of other animes out there, but the basic premise is the same -- we get a group of people who are working together to solve sci-fi mysteries...and there is definitely nothing wrong with that.\nA friend of mine introduced me to this series, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised overall.\nIf you love having vampires and mummies, among other things, show up in your anime, along with a HUGE dosage of humor to boot, then you will absolutely LOVE this show -- it manages to take dark subject matter and make it into something comical.\nI think the biggest weakness in this series is definitely a coherent side story -- it seems like things are a little too hashed together at times, and a little too rushed. On top of that, half of the Phantom Quest team only shows up when actually needed to do something, such as the team exorcist and the fortune teller -- neither of these two characters really gets a strong introduction at all.\nOne more weakness would really be in the music as well, which I found continuously grating on my nerves -- mainly, the theme song. Most of the other music is just merely OK.\n\nComplaints aside, this is definitely worth your time, especially for such a small price -- buy this one, you certainly won\u0027t regret it\n",
    "\nTo be honest, I think I found this by looking at listmania lists when I was searching for other anime titles.

    "\nI really liked this film.  Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker.  This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today.  You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you\u0027re infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors.  I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest.  It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World.  It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time.  Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year).  Moore in recent years has become a \"political celebrity\", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America.  It\u0027s not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too.  They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows.  A lot of them aren\u0027t really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods.  I don\u0027t know if Moore is like that or not.  But this is still a potent, darkly funny film about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working class in America.  \n\n",

    "\nFrida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end; so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound.  This is due to its subject, its star, and its director, Julie Taymor, who also gave us the astounding Titus.  (If you have not yet seen Titus, do so before finishing this review - it is an art director\u0027s tour de force on a par with Brazil.)\n\nRegardless of where one falls on the political spectrum, one can\u0027t help but be intrigued by the fascinating, and certainly unconventional, people of Frida.  Diego Rivera, played superbly by Alfred Molina, boasted the traditional faults of great artists, (narcissism, thoughtless cruelty, obsessive egotism), while showcasing some exceptional ones, (art as propaganda device, naive political idealism).  His flaws were as large as his murals, but he was never dull.\n\nIn addition to starring as Frida, Salma Hayek co-produced the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made.  How wonderful that she did.  Hayek has traveled under a Hollywood curse, appearing in one dreadful picture after another.  This is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by, and her performance is note perfect.  The story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy, but Hayek never lets that happen.  Her Frida is heart and steel all at once - amazing.\n\nThe take home message, if there is one, is that great art is never free.  In the case of Rivera, others paid the price; he fed off others like a greedy child.  In the case of Frida Kahlo, she herself paid the price, digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave.  There are moments of magic realism in Frida, where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa - if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were, astounding autobiographical statements.\n\nThere are a few missteps.  The liaisons with Trotsky and Josephine Baker feel almost obligatory, as if a form is being filled out.  But blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments, for example, when Rivera\u0027s dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in Mexico.\n\nBeyond highly recommended - must viewing.\n",

    "\nOf all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of Allah on that day, this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching.  Because of this, those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events.  And perhaps none more so than \"Caesar\" in his review of Sept. 17, 2006.  If only he found at least as troubling the carnage, bloodshed, and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his Islamic buddies against civilian populations.  But, more on this in a bit.  \n\nAs regards this extraordinary video, from the perspectives of air traffic controllers, FAA officials, NORAD and NEADS, the air crews and passengers on board each of the four doomed flights, to the testimonies of the witnesses, participants, firefighters, and all the heroes on and near Ground Zero, this is the singular documentary that takes you minute by minute through the hell deliberately planned and perpetrated by those whose religion had them believing that the execution of such hellish bloodshed granted them virgin-laden heaven.  (and no... this is not the \"propaganda\" or view of the documentary, but instead my own conclusions drawn on many years of personal investigation of Islam).\n\nAnyone who, like \"Caesar\" here, could watch this fully factual account and then call such a splendid documentary \"goody-goody propaganda\" \"try(ing) to portray the US as good guys being hit by the bad guys...\" reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own anti-American hatred for so apparently condoning such ghastly blood-soaked horrors as the acts of \"good guys\" retaliating against \"bad guys.\"  \n\nWhile \"Caesar\" (how telling a nickname) attempts to school us ignorant Americans on our country\u0027s past political-policy foibles, yet he fails to mention the billions in financial and economic aid we have given the Islamic nations, the millions in military equipment and technical advisory assistance provided them as they struggled against invading Soviet forces and/or other foreign enemies attempting to annex and rule over sovereign Islamic nations, the ousting from Kuwait of the brutal armed forces of an Islamic fascist dictator who had invaded and then \"enjoyed\" weeks of the metaphoric and all too literal raping in this tiny Islamic nation while openly looting, terrorizing, butchering, torturing, and murdering its citizens while none of its Islamic neighbors lifted so much as a finger to intervene, but instead begged the United Nations and the U.S. to solve their problems for them... which we did!  And these are just a tiny listing of the far greater acts we have done for the cause of justice and good, and all of it on Islam\u0027s behalf.  And yet, 9/11 is only the latest and greatest terrorist massacre by which we continue to be repaid by the bloodthirsty religion of Islam for all we have done and continue to do on its behalf.\n\n\"Caesar\" also glaringly omits and all too conveniently ignores radical Islam\u0027s blood-soaked history and their on-going policy of religiously motivated bomb blasts, hijackings, kidnappings, tortures, rapes, gang rapes, female circumcisions, sawing and/or hacking off people\u0027s limbs and heads, mutilations, and always... mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide, including those of their own religion, and all thanks to Islam\u0027s foundational tenets of blood lust that makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable, eternally rewardable, and thus... forever inevitable.  \n\nTrue, all religions have their radicals and fanatics.  But none deliberately attract, nurture, and encourage terrorist fanatics more than does Islam.  And none preaches genocide against the entire Jewish race/nation and all non-Islamic \"infidels\" in the name of God more than does Islam.  And it is how this video accurately documents for the entire world only this latest and greatest mass butchery in the name of Allah that probably motivates \"Caesar\" most to attempt such blatant anti-U.S. propagandizing here.  And for those who would disagree, I challenge \"Caesar\" or anyone else to provide us any reliable evidence of even a single factual error in this documentary. \n\nWhat I think \"Caesar\" fears most is that such a powerful documentary as this might add to the growing world view that despite the constant rhetoric of Islam as a religion of \"peace,\" the ever-escalating terrorist acts of its leaders and constituents in the name of Islamic religion reveal the exact opposite to be the true case.  Maybe it\u0027s just me, but I\u0027m thinking any religion that so encourages its hormone-driven young men to blow themselves up with as many \"infidels\" as they can so as to spend eternity in orgiastic sex with 72 virgins deserves to be fully prosecuted, at the very least on charges of \"conspiracy to commit (mass) murder\"!\n\nAnd one thought that just hit me:  If more and more Islamics continue to either commit or condone such bloodshed and with the full approval of their Islamic leaders, which god are they truly honoring and emulating:  Allah -- the Creator of Life; or instead, Iblis (Satan), the Destroyer of it?  By their fruits are they known, after all.\n\nAnd on the question of whom and what Islamics most worship and adore, permit me to close this review as also does this wonderful documentary, by quoting one of Islam\u0027s most renowned clerics:\n\n\"We love death.  The U.S. loves Life.  That is the big difference between us.\"    -- Osama bin Laden  \n",

    "\nThis 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn\u0027t feel as audacious as I\u0027m sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn\u0027t be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.\n\nThe plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with \"Foul Play\" and \"Nine to Five\") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters\u0027 actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.\n\nRuth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It\u0027s really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold\u0027s eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens\u0027 soundtrack hasn\u0027t aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel\u0027s music in \"The Graduate\", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included\n",
    "\nThis presents us with a visual voyage into music that, in my opinion, excels that if the original Fantasia. Not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid, colorful, and highly diverse from segment to segment, but the representation of the music is, in itself, sheer genius. As I have come to expect from Disney, at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure. This much, I believe, is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music\n",
    "\n   I have to say, it took me a while to getting around to seeing this.  I thought \"Silence Of The Lambs\" was good - it featured a great performance by Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of it was....good.  But that was about it, as far as I was concerned.  It just didn\u0027t really click with me, and it wasn\u0027t anything near the great movie I\u0027d been hoping for, so when its sequel was released I didn\u0027t feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released.  A bit surprisingly though, I thought \"Hannibal\" was really great once I finally did see it.  Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than \"Silence...\" (which is fine by me) and it may have been, marginally.  But much more than that, it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor, and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie, in my opinion.  Hopkins is just as good, if not better, than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around, and while I usually don\u0027t like recasting roles in a movie (unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you don\u0027t see their real face or hear their real voice, and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster.\n\n   The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original, pre-incarceration, carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter.  It seems like \"Hannibal\" has changed tract from \"Silence\" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter\u0027s victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves.  Whether that\u0027s the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible, the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who\u0027s even more evil than he is.  Hannibal Lecter himself is, well, he\u0027s not a \u0027good guy\u0027 in this movie; he is, though, presented in very cryptic shades of grey.  His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real, and he\u0027s much more interesting as a character this time around.  Clarice also is; she comes across here as a character who\u0027s somehow traumatized, perhaps even mentally unbalanced, deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it, and that\u0027s what so intrigued him in the first place.  One possible interpretation of things overall (and this is just one of many potential takes on it; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie-lovers) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had/has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil, while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal-level violence in her, but chose to be good, chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness.  A lot of food for thought in this one (no pun intended). \n\n   Great performances all around; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter\u0027s nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under-rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable, rather creepy FBI agent who\u0027s constantly at odds with Starling.  A very, very engaging and wel-made movie\n",
    "\nWe just got this DVD last week, but ever since that time it has remained in the DVD player and has been viewed at least a dozen times by my three year old daughter, Cassidy. She LOVES this DVD and all the planets that come to life.  She sings along and has really learned her planets.  The songs are top notch.  The DVD is enjoyable for adults, even after ten viewings when most kid videos would become painful.  A+++++++++++ \n",
    "\nMoonlighting is one of the greatest series to ever grace television. Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd have a chemistry that just makes the episodes work.

I\u0027m very happy I decided to buy these DVDs.\n",
    "\n\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\" is a powerful book with many mixed emotions. This film was a constant mystery as I never knew what would happen next. The story is all about the people who affected Eddie the most in his life. The people he meets in Heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking.  Some people he knew, and some he had never met. This was a great idea. \nMitch Albom kept me wanting to read as I usually am not too interested in books. This truly is the greatest book I\u0027ve ever read and therefore I would definitely recommend it to everyone.\n\n",
    "\nMicrophone {tap, tap, tap}: Ladies and gentlemen! For your wrestling entertainment, I introduce to you the Lord\u0027s Luchador, the Mauling Monk, the Orphanator! Put your hands together for Naaaacho Liiiibbbbre!\n\nJack Black (KING KONG) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess\u0027 latest cinematic offering, NACHO LIBRE. Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who\u0027s early dreams of becoming a luchador (wrestler) come to fruition later in life. \n\nJack Black plays Nacho, a cook at an orphanage/monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily. But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler. His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera (LADIES NIGHT), and by a wily thief named Esqueleto (SUPERVIVENCIA), a streetwise thug with bizarre moves. Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring, only to be beaten time and again, but still making money. But making money isn\u0027t enough for Nacho (\"I want to win!\"). Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner, including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs. \n\nFinally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his \"inner\" strength to make his way to the top.\n\nSilliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre, but it is saved by Jack Black\u0027s incredible physical comedy. Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast. The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental (Cow dung to the face? A wasps nest to the head? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow?) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion, the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt-muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion! \t\n\nNapoleon Dynamite fans will flock to Hess\u0027 latest film, and will probably be amazed at what he accomplished with a little more cash and a few Hollywood well-known actors\n",
    "\nIts been a long time since I have laughed this much!!!! Getting down to \"the nitty gritty\" it is an enjoyable comedy.  The chemistry between Jack Black \"Nacho\" and Hector Jimenez \"Esqueleto\" is what makes the movie so funny. His accent was not Mexican but very funny. My family and I just loved the movie, which I think we have seen 5 times in the theatre\n",

    "\nFederico Fellini\u0027s 1972 film is not his best, when he has 8 1/2, La Strada and La Dolce Vita to his credit. While many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless, dreamy structure, I found it boring and phantasmagorical. It is simply Fellini\u0027s version of Rome and not Rome, the Eternal City itself. To risk sounding negative, I shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970\u0027s Rome - the scenes in which the hippies and American tourists invade the city, the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off (though saying some pretty vulgar things) and my favorite scene- the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old Roman Patricians fade into oblivion. But mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot. It starts off alright, and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences. Fellini is himself in this movie, as well as Gore Vidal. Fellini envisions himself as a young man studying Rome in his youth in a strict Catholic school (the slide/projector shows ancient monuments like the Colliseum, the Apian Way, Trevi Fountain and Vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman\u0027s behind) and later as a young man journeys to Rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum. Then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless, vulgar and long-winded. I found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage! It bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution, brothels or cheap, slutty women. The cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film. And for a film about Rome and Italy, there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater. The Pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous. Only serious, hardcore fans of Fellini will want to own this DVD. It is a perfect follow-up to his equally absurd and sexually radical Satyricon, loosely based on the old Roman epic.\n",

    "\n If you\u0027re even showing an interest to vol.2 then you most likely own or have seen vol.1. Even then I recommend this one as much as any of them, since you gotta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end. Anyways, vol.2 offers the same fun antics the 1st vol. did, BUT unfortunately when compared to vol.1 you\u0027ll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all. Any sword fighting that actually occur usually doesn\u0027t last long enough to be considered a \"fight\". But this DVD makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the 1st vol. So enjoy it, I know I did\n",

    "\nThis movie has recieved several bad reviews and I can understand that. This movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical \"first gay love movie\", but if you like movies that are not, this one if a must have. The movie is not a hardcore sex movie, in fact there is only one scene of sex, in the movie. The positives of this movie are, it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love, one that doesn\u0027t turn out in the same way other movies portray. Again, I only recomend this movie to people who enjoy complex movies and are not looking for just hardcore sex\n",
    "\nI love this movie. While the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film, \"She\u0027s All That\" doesn\u0027t go overboard and, surprisingly, presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata.\n\nAfter Zach, the class president and soccer star, is very publically dumped by his \"magically delicious\" (and equally popular) girlfriend, Taylor, he\u0027s hard put to maintain his legacy.\n\nUber-jock, though a little slow, Zach\u0027s friend, Dean, bets him that he can\u0027t replace Taylor and make any girl prom queen.\n\nEnter Laney Boggs, an art student who cares little about the social scene. Dean picks Laney as Zach\u0027s prom queen \"project\" and Zach has a hard time convincing Laney to even go out with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor, the ex, is dating a Real World reject who she met over spring break, but she\u0027s still catty over her \"discards\" and is horrible to Laney, embarassing her at a party.\n\nThe more time Zach spends with Laney, the more he starts to like her and Laney begins to open up and finds a real outlet in her art.\n\nDean, sensing he might be about to lose the bet, asks Laney to prom before Zach gets around to it and, a recently single Taylor, attaches herself to Zach\u0027s arm, assuming he\u0027ll take her back.\n\nUltimately, feelings are hurt, battle lines are drawn...and a really cool dance scence takes place at the prom.\n\nI love the fresh comedy in the movie that is amusing for teens without being impractical or raunchy. The characters are well-developed and actually evolve in a realistic fashion (even if you are left wondering how nice-guy Zach ever dated self-absorbed Taylor Vaughn).\n\nAll-in-all, there\u0027s really nothing comparable to the teen movies like \"Sixteen Candles\" or \"Pretty In Pink\" because those are genres unto themselves, but \"She\u0027s All That\" is definitely a nice representation of a good, modern teen movie\n",
    "\nWhat more could a true Parrotthead ask for than Jimmy Buffett live at Wrigley Field?\n\nThis two-disc DVD set captures the truly historic concert from Chicago. Jimmy and the band put on a great show. It makes you feel as though you were part of the show.\n\nThe bonus coverage is not to be miseed. The time lapse of setting up the stage is fun to watch. And the Star-Spangled Banner performance rivals Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThis is a must for any music lover, but the true Parrottheads will definitely need to add it to their collection\n",

    "\nIf there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides \"Saving Private Ryan,\" this is it.\n\nThe story starts with a lawyer visiting England as a tourist years after war\u0027s end. He discovers a cheap, ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value. \"Value?\" replies the lawyer. \"Wrap it very carefully\" he adds. So begins his mental journey back in time to the English airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th (nine, eighteenth) Bomb Group.\n\nThis \"hard luck\" group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has \"over-identified\" with his men, thus putting them before his missions. The general, Frank Savage, must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit.\n\nGeneral Savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit. They turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind, or letting down their new leader. (Each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel piece in the Officers\u0027 Club, and turning the head of a ceramic pirate, face outward.)\n\nBut the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes. He will always keep the mission first, and will not over-identify with his men. He will not let the loss of his men affect him. \n\nOr, will he?\n\nThis black \u0026 white story is exceptional and superbly acted. It shows the mental tug-of-war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect. It depicts how the ugliness of war brings out the best in ourselves, and creates fraternal bonds that last a lifetime.\n\nThis is not a gory story, but it is one that will leave you breathless. It may sadden you, but it will not disappoint you. It does not end with everyone living, or happy.\n\nWar never does.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. The \"whole nine yards\" refers to the length of ammunition linked together that fed into the machine guns aboard each bomber\n",

    "\n I love Leslie Sansone\u0027s videos. She\u0027s quirky and a bit \"ditzy\", but her workouts are always easy to follow and fun; this is no exception. There have been previous complaints about her cues not being good enough, but I had absolutely no problems- even on my first try. If you don\u0027t want to miss a beat, pay close attention at first- you\u0027ll hear the directions.\n I bought this because I loved Walk and Jog so much. Walk and Kick is not quite as intense, but it still works up a sweat. For a day where you\u0027re not working quite as hard, this is a great workout for people interested in a bit of kickboxing (but not for experience kickboxers). \n I also saw complaints about Leslie saying some silly things about the size of her nose, dusting the floor, etc; this is classic Leslie chatter, and I personally think it makes the workout go faster. If you don\u0027t like the chatter of her other videos, you wont like this one.\n As an avid WATP video user, I give this one a big thumbs up.\n",
    "\nExcellent pay per view. One of the best of 2002.

For 300+ pounders, 3 Minute Warning really can move. Surprise ending.\n\n2) Cruiserweight Championship: Jamie Noble (champion) vs. Billy Kidman (5/5)\nBoth looked impressive during the match putting on a superb bout. Watch for Noble\u0027s sick DDT and Kidman aerial moveset.\n\n3) Hardcore Match for Women\u0027s Championship: Trish Stratus (champion) vs. Victoria (4/5)\nA solid women\u0027s division match. Tons of weapons but a weak finish. Victoria supposedly injured her ACL in this match but I couldn\u0027t find the spot. Maybe you can.\n\n4) WWE Championship: Brock Lesnar (champion) vs. Big Show (2/5)\nOf course Brock was able to suplex the Big Show and Brock was able to get him up for the F-5, which Paul Heyman doubted. The match unfolded quickly and equipped a strong end.\n\n5) WWE Tag Team Championship Elimination Match: Edge \u0026 Rey Mysterio (champions) vs. Kurt Angle \u0026 Chris Benoit vs. Los Guerreros (3/5)\nUsing a Tag Title bout as a warm-down match didn\u0027t pay out well. Rey possessed an intense aereal arsenal compared to his present one. Worth watching.\n\n6) World Championship Elimination Chamber Match: Triple H (champion) vs. Kane vs. Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Booker T vs. Shawn Michaels (4/5)\nI was hoping someone would bring the match atop the chamber, but was disappointed. And the fact that Jericho was a World Tag Team champion at the time puzzled me, since Christian, his partner, wasn\u0027t even on the show. Besides that, a great Main Event. RVD nearly crushed Triple H\u0027s throat at one point. Jericho knew how to work an Elimination Chamber at perfectly.\n\nOverall 4/5 for Survivor Series 2002. Worth buying\n",

    "\nSYBIL is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public. The performances by Sally Field and Joanne Woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter (child abuse) and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed. Wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques, both the book and the movie became musts for students of Abnormal Psychology at that time and for decades afterwards.\nJoanne Woodward reverses her roles from \"The Three Faces Of Eve\" to portray Dr. Cornelia Wilbur with consummate skill, while Sally Field\u0027s performance as Sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another (the movie works with thirteen of the Book\u0027s sixteen personalities).  Without being overtly graphic, the movie conveys all of the horrors of Sybil\u0027s childhood with an incredible impact.\nThe rest of the cast is excellent, with Martine Bartlett\u0027s \"Hattie\", Sybil\u0027s mother, in the chilling forefront and Natasha Ryan as Little Sybil close behind.\nThe real Sybil, unaware that Sally Field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with Joanne Woodward, let it be known that she wanted Stewart Stern and Daniel Petrie to try and get Sally for her part. {From the Extras Bonus Disk)\nI can\u0027t recommend the movie and the book enough to students of Human Behavior and Psychology, whether for personal of professional interests.\nIt took Hollywood 30 years to try remaking the film, which should indicate how high the bar was set by this original cast and production\n",

I truly enjoy working out, but when I find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up, I know I hit the jackpot.  This workout can be perfect for most exercisers, although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the Super Challenge.

    "\nAN ANIMATED FAMILY OF X-MEN -- COMPLETE WITH SPANDEX \u0026 IT ALL TURNS OUT PRETTY - - WELL - - INCREDIBLE: \n\nPixar and Disney have made six exceptional films together, but I find myself reaching for this one almost every time. \n\nNeedless to say, superhero films are no longer novelties, yet this film seems to have new angles on seemingly cliched themes. The lawsuits that put the \"Supers\" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed \"The Incredibles\" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well - - PRETTY INCREDIBLE! \n\nWHAT IT\u0027S ALL ABOUT: \n\nFirst we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as \"Supers\" and instead turns into Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Average American after the lawsuits that ended the \"Supers\" crime fighting dynasty. Along the way they had three very different yet \"Super\" offspring! Wow, that\u0027s enough right there to keep us busy. \n\nWe also have sub-plots which include each one of the 3 children\u0027s coming of age in a \"Super\" way, but as ordinary kids. The kids, like their parents, struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family. \n\nWe have Bob Parr [Mr. Incredible] going through what appears to be a mid-life crisis, and his confused wife, Helen, who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else. But, after all, how can \"Elastigirl\" be just another soccer mom? We have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan [Buddy] who turns \"The Incredibles\" lives upside-down and inside-out. For the first time, the \"Supers\" are the underdogs! \n\nEVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS - SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES \u0026 MUCH MORE: \n\nAfter these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles\u0027 family issues worked out like any other family\u0027s, but with many interesting twists. \"The Incredibles\" is a SUPER film! \n\nDVD FEATURES: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.39:1 [very widescreen] Digital to Digital Transfer is the sharpest I have seen yet! \n\nLots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did. \n\nThe \"Jack-Jack Attack\" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between \"Jack-Jack\" and the baby-sitter. I just wish it was longer. The behind the scenes \"Featurettes\" are worth watching as are the blooper scenes, though they seem a bit contrived. \n\nThere are two commentary tracks, one with Brad Bird [writer/director] and John Walker [producer]. and another with the animators. I could not watch the entire movie with either track on. Maybe you can. The files about the \"Supers\" are interesting. There is lots more. If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone. \n\nFor me, however, there is the film. This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun-filled, family sort of way. \n\n",
    "\nIt\u0027s interesting to read some of the other reviews. I can\u0027t understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie. It\u0027s imaginative, as was \"Nightmare Before Christmas\", but goes beyond that movie with even better stop-action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving. I loved \"Nightmare\", but Corpse Bride takes all the things I loved and made them better. The voices of all the actors ring true. The mood is gothic and yet comical. The score is rich and defines the movie perfectly. (The DVD allows you to watch the movie with only the music, and that\u0027s a real plus.)\n",
    "\nAwesome! Bought for my husband for Valentine\u0027s Day!  Even our 8 year old son loved it.  Excellent condition\n",
    "\nGreat story.  Great actors.  Beautiful scenery and colors.  My favorite movie\n",
    "\n\"Student of History\" is a student of Christian biased history. There are plenty of qualified scholars, and current book like that of theologian Bart Ehman for one, who show that early Christianity was based on forged documents that claimed earlier pedigree, but were written by ambitious men who sought to dominate a very wide spead of ideas about who and what those events in Judea were about. (Not Paliestine! The Romans named the region Palestine after the war against the Jews in 70CE). The fact that one man (Constantine) sought a single authoritive finality was a political move, not an act or miracle of \"God.\" Authority of apostles is more Christian myth and power assertion, not historical proof of the varacity of the Bible and Christian claims. Objective scholarship has shown for example that a church father (probably Iraneus) forged copies of Josephus by adding the paragraphs that refer to Jesus. It is easy to understand when we remember that typewriters and copy machines did not exist then! Handwriting is sort of a give-away, especially when other earlier copies exist with no insets about Jesus. What is known about the Gospel of Thomas and other second century altnative Christian texts is that they were warred against by the eventual winner. It might have gone otherwise and then people like you would be claiming a completely different set of circumstances as facts. People with no authority like Iraneus wrote tracts condemning any other view than his own and those of his small cult. He called Arius of Alexander for example, a heretic. But he had no authority to do so. He forged documents to prove it never realizing that in the future, others would also forge whatever they found expedient to make reality for believers. Paul called it \"Lying to bring you the truth.\" But a lie is a lie and historians can\u0027t make lies facts. So the yoke of bias due to conditioned belief must be thrown off if one is to be a true historian and seeker of truth.\n\nThe real \"key\" to the entire mystery - and the inspiration for all of these writers is the nagging reality of the original parchments found by the real life priest Beringer Saunier in 1891 in Rennes-le-Chateau. I have been there several times. The original parchments are kept in a vault in London at a Loyd\u0027s Bank. The copies have been studied by many and here is the problem for the debunkers; When a fraud is being perpetuated, code puzzles are invariably simple and unsophisticated. Experts agree that the codes on the parchments are so sophisticated that they would have had to have been created by a very intelligent individual - a genuis. Everything can be argued down for lack of enough solid evidence if you wish to prefer Christian myths like virgin birth, death and resurrection (actually earlier pagan myths), but the parchments remain a piece of evidence that no un objecive debunker likes to talk about. \n\nDan Brown has made the subject popular again by writing a book and making a film that tantilizes the minds of many people. He also gives the public a new level of nonsense to wade through and a rich source of psuedo history for debunkers to feast upon, pretending to extend their claim to truth by turning over toys in a kindergarten class.\n\nIf you are going to claim to be a student of history, you must be objective and ready to accept what is there, not select what suits you. And if you want to answer the many very quesitonable claims of Chrisitanity and the claimed history of the faith, then you must be willing to question the premises. Once you do that, you will find that there is plenty to support doubt. Just knowing about the Catholic destruction of previous historic and relgious records along with anyone who opposed them, ought to clue the thinking person that something is up with tradtional Christian Western history on its face.\n\nDan Brown, and and to a greater extent, Leigh, Baigent and Lincoln have a lot more material than that planted and represented by Pierre Plantard. The discussion of the Biblical evidence itself is compelling without ever having Pierre Plantard at all. Why is there a large tradition of all people extant at the time that Simon of Cyrene was crucified, not Jesus? (Muslims claim this today and Christian Freemasons are aware of the source document- I have seen it myself). And if we really want to be factual about it, there never was a Jesus Christ in Judea. Paul created his church in Greece and the Hellenized region of Asia Minor. \"Jesus Christ\" is Greek. If there was a character that Jesus was based on his name would have been Josua ben Joseph and his brother \"James\" would be Jacob. If you dig in you will find no basis for a person named Jesus exists and the probability that the Jesus Christ character was only Paul\u0027s creation based on another person who was crucified as a rebel by the Romans and whose sect venerated his death as a memorial that became part of their sect of Judiasm.\n\nOne book of found in the Dead Sea Scrolls is the Book of Enoch. Freemasons have owned a copy of it and it is tracable to at least 1717 when the Grand Lodge in London announced itself. How does a book that only became known to the public when the closely guarded srolls were finally made public in the 1990s, already exist among a society of brotherhood that can be traced to the Knights Templar? This is not myth, but a sample of factual connections one can make if they objectively study the quesitons, culling out the fluff and theory from fact for 20 years as I have. \n\nI didn\u0027t just read, I traveled. It takes a long time to verify or debunk a historical claim or theory. These people who study the subject for a year and then write a book amuse me, but very well. I completely enjoyed the film, The Da Vinci Code, even though I could not read the book, because I knew too much of the where he got his ideas from to read it. Leigh Teaging\u003d Richard Leigh, Teabing \u003d Michael Baigent, and the GM of the Priory named Sauniere. There is a code for begginers in the book, but I am no beginner. Still, I found the film enjoyable and I even thought the book is a good thing, because I am a bit like the Leigh Teabing character in the Da Vinci Code. I believe that a lie even to build a faith is a lie and overall, the worse will come from it. Histoy shows that to be true. Religions are built on lies made for the purpose of power and control over others. What we witness now in the world is more of that with more and worse to come. It is probably useless, but only when people can know the real truth and throw off the superstition and neurosis of religion, including and especially Christianity (but all others as well) will the human race have a chance to become something besides a mass of ants bent of self destruction.\n\nIf there is any use for the historian, it must be to serve as a witness and a warning. How long will we repeat history? As long as we insist on institutionalizing lies and myth.\n\nIn the meantime, established Christian indluence and owned media produce airy debates quoting the Bible and it\u0027s own set of Biblical facts as ultimate fact because they haven\u0027t yet gone to the bottom of the scholarly bebate - and don\u0027t want to.\n",
    "\nI have loved this movie since I first it back in the early 1990\u0027s. In all honesty it is pretty crudy but that\u0027s what I love about it. The music is fantastic and the costumes are unique. Divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and Ricki Lake was perfect for the role. Link is pretty hunky too.....\n",
    "\nI never tire of this film. The acting,the marvelous filming locations, the costumes.... perfection. I can\u0027t watch it without wanting to have a cup of tea and a hot scone to accompany the viewing. In fact, I once stopped the video, baked scones, and continued to watch it while munching a freshly baked scone and a cuppa. Try it. I now own the DVD also\n",
    "\nI have no idea why I had never heard of this movie before because Ronin is a whale of a good film.  I can take or leave most action films, but give me a taut, intelligent, suspenseful thriller filled with great action, wicked twists, and some of the best car-chasing footage you\u0027ll ever see, and I\u0027m happy.  Throw Jean Reno and the one and only Robert De Niro into the mix, as well, and I\u0027m happier than any clam has a right to be.  Director John Frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone doesn\u0027t make for a good action film, and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene.\n\nThe title is derived from the term for masterless Samurai of feudal Japan - warriors who failed their master and were left to wander in the shame of their failure.  In modern parlance (and in this movie), the term applies to special agents of various governments who find themselves quite on their own thanks to the end of the Cold War.  These men still put their skills to good use by selling their services to those willing to pay them for handling sensitive, usually dirty, jobs.  In this case, Sam (De Niro), Vincent (Reno), and three others are brought together in France by an Irish lass named Deirdre and charged with acquiring a metal case well-protected by its current carrier.  It sounds easy - ambush the target and his security force, snatch the case, exchange it for cash, and move on.  Naturally, the mission turns out to be extremely complicated, as a couple of powerful parties want whatever is in that case, and a certain individual proves less than trustworthy.  What\u0027s the world coming to when you can\u0027t even trust a selfish, independent-minded, well-trained gun-for-hire?  De Niro has to run over and shoot up half of France before everything gets resolved in this film.\n\nThe only problem I had with this movie came in the form of the thick accents of some of the characters, especially the Irish ones - you may want to use closed captioning at times to really understand everything that is said.  The actors themselves, though, were quite good, especially De Niro and Reno, who make a great team.  As for the mix of bad guys, how about three - count \u0027em, three - former adversaries of James Bond (Michael Lonsdale, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Pryce)?  Not only that, the script is worthy of all these fine actors.  \n\nAs I\u0027ve mentioned already, though, the chase scenes are really the most memorable aspect of this film.  Frankenheimer doesn\u0027t have any use for these fancy-schmancy new digital means for manufacturing this kind of action, instead treating the viewer to several good, old-fashioned thrill rides through the streets of Paris and its local environs.  Besides filming an incredible number of scenes live, he also chose to forego the accompaniment of a musical score in these situations, letting the revving engines, squealing brakes, and numerous crashes and explosions present the action as authentically as possible.  They had to have had an incredible number of stunt drivers and stunt men involved, as folks were constantly crashing or jumping out of the path of oncoming cars - not to mention the extended high speed chase down one-way streets into busy oncoming traffic.  I\u0027m telling you - these chase scenes are flat-out impressive.  \n\nObviously, I think Ronin has it all.  Without De Niro, it still would have been a fantastic film; with him, it\u0027s a must-see in my book\n",
    "\n\"The Bells of St. Mary\u0027s\" was a shrewd move by Paramount Studios and director Leo McCarey, whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical Catholic priest Father O\u0027Malley, \"Going My Way\", spawned the 1945 release, which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict.  Irish Catholic McCarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed \"Going My Way\" and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the Catholic world inhabited by Father O\u0027Malley.\n\nBing Crosby had garnered a Best Actor Oscar for \"Going My Way\" and McCarey secured the services of the beautiful Ingrid Bergman to play Sister Benedict, the Mother Superior of St. Mary\u0027s School.  Crosby found himself immediately clashing with Bergman on certain points relating to the parish, but through it all a mutual respect existed between them.  Each realized that the other was committed to the best interests of St. Mary\u0027s.\n\nDudley Nichols, a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award winner a decade earlier for the John Ford film about the Irish political conflict starring Victor McLaglen, \"The Informer\", directed his effort in the script toward presenting Crosby and Bergman in periodic conflict, but learning from those experiences.  Much of the contrast, they realize, stems from the way that men and women view situations.  One phase of the film showing this difference is when Bergman teaches a young student who has been victimized by a bully how to box as a means of restoring order.  She feels a tinge of guilt since the youngster\u0027s failure to fight back and receipt of a beating in the process stemmed from his obedience to her stricture against fighting at St. Mary\u0027s.  \n\nWhen Crosby pursues a conventional macho posture in extolling the need for protecting oneself and praises the fighting skills of the bully, the nun has had enough.  She purchases a boxing instructional book written by former heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and adeptly instructs the obedient youngster in the manly art of self-defense as he ultimately teaches the bully a lesson.  Crosby recognizes her teaching skill and becomes cognizant of the strength of her feminine viewpoint.\n\nAn area where Crosby and Bergman cooperate is in seeking the answer to the nun\u0027s fervent prayer.  She believes that of the mortgage holder of their property, Henry Travers, who has built a modern building next door and seeks to use the church property for an employee parking lot, may through prayer and proper persuasion be convinced to give them his modern structure.  The result would be a new school and no further need to use the tired current facility.\n\nThe effectiveness of Crosby and Bergman stems from their soft sell technique with just the right pinch of Christian charitable thought thrown into the mix.  Travers, who cannot sleep nights and experiences heart problems, confides to the priest and nun separately that he wishes he was better liked.  \n\nTheir soft sell approach in advancing the \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\" precept along with the accompanying feel good element of charity prompts Travers to see things in a light more favorable to the interests of St. Mary\u0027s.\n\nCrosby and Bergman are delights to behold in this feel good film.  They provide challenges to each other through disagreement and an effective front when they team up on the issue of greatest importance to them, the welfare of St. Mary\u0027s parish.\n",
    "\nI really did; i would watch it almost everyday! It was my favorite movie back then! I held this tradition until... (sob)... my mom threw away our copy! I don\u0027t CARE if the tape was old! I still wanna see it! (I\u0027m gonna buy it on DVD soon! ^_^) Fluke is a great movie the whole family can enjoy. It\u0027s an original story that should make you cry. It even has a pretty funny ending! I can\u0027t wait to see this movie again... anyway, this movie is about a man who dies in a car-crash and gets reincarnated as a dog--I know a lot of peeps out there that don\u0027t believe in reincarnation but just remember, this is fiction--anyway, as he grows older, he wants to see his wife and kid even more. He decides to find them. He one day sees them in a parking lot (and can\u0027t remember what they did, the last time I saw this movie was a couple years ago) and he ran up to the car window and scared his wife. She told him to shoo and after a while he got off the car and watched them drive away (i think). I sadly can\u0027t remember what happened after that but I know he goes to his house and his son asks if they can keep him for a pet. The mother agrees, reluctantly. I dont remember a lot of the rest but i know he meets another guy that was reincarnated as a dog and they become friends...and...uh...NO! I NEED TO WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN!!! I just bought the book, so after I read the book, I plan to watch the movie. BWA HA HA~~!!! Anyway, it\u0027s a fun-filled movie. Watch it\n",

    "\nHow many times have you watched an exercise video hosted by a bouncy, perky blonde with a plastic smile making you feel like a fat, lazy slob? Or maybe it was an arrogant Hollywood trainer with that \"fitter than thou\" sneer... these instructors just don\u0027t seem like real people with real lives outside the gym, do they?\n\nWell, Ana Caban is different. She has a warm, relaxed presence with grace borne of years of ballet. She explains the moves thoroughly without talking down to the viewer, and she gives the impression that she does Pilates because she likes the results - not because she is an obsessive-compulsive exercise fanatic. The exercises are geared toward the beginner, yet offer enough of a challenge to keep you busy for a while. When you\u0027ve mastered the beginner workout, she also leads an intermediate workout which offers greater challenges, but the familiarity of Ana\u0027s friendly demeanor.\n\nI have a hard time making myself exercise, but when it comes to buckling down and choosing something to do for myself, this is the DVD I pop in the machine.

    "\nWitch Hunter Robin is a great series which I enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series. The visuals are first rate, the music (when there is music) is beautiful, and the storyline is intriguing. \n\nSilence and extended stares cloak the characters in mystery... so what\u0027s the problem? That same cloak covers the series in what could potentially be a series of yawns.\n\nOne of the major problems with Witch Hunter Robin is the pace. Many serious animes either take themselves too seriously or not seriously enough... WHR takes itself much too seriously. Surely the story and visuals are worth it but for some reason there are long, tiring sequences during the course of the series which are supposed to be \"meaningful.\" \n\nThey are I suppose in retrospect (one will notice this once they watch the final episodes of WHR), but the events in the series do not warrant such extended periods of self reflection on the part of the main character(s). The psychological and philosophical themes present are obvious toward the end of the series, and where they are not, the intelligent viewer can pretty much guess at them.\n\nI realize that this exhausted review of WHR seems to only be about the tiresome pace at which the series progresses, but it\u0027s an important factor as it leaves many to simply drop the series half way before ever seeing the later episodes (the best episodes in my opinion).\n\nA second problem is also the fact that there are a number of \"witch capturing\" which take place during the series that seem... well, silly. The beginning of the series is all about these capturing - surely after seeing the last couple of episodes the viewer begins to understand how this ties into rounding out the characters but during the course of the series this might just bore you to tears especially if a number of episodes feature witch/enemies that simply don\u0027t interest you (which they may not, the creativity and design behind many of them is poor to say the least).\n\nIn the end the series is about the characters, story, and visuals not the enemies which frequently populated much of the series - if you find yourself hooked on the main characters and their back-stories when they are introduced in the beginning of the series then you might like the whole thing.\n\nLastly as for reviewers that were expecting something \"scary,\" most of the shows on Adult Swim are for adults and the anime shows featured on Adult Swim are geared toward those typically interested in other things beside quick thrills (needless to say those watching the series probably aren\u0027t into it because the name of the series is \"Witch Hunter,\" they are instead - hopefully - looking for a high quality, cohesive action/drama anime). This is not for individuals wanting to watch an action anime however... it\u0027s more of a beautiful drama. Younger anime viewers are not bound to like this one at all!!!\n\nI\u0027d give it a try first renting it before you go out and spend money on it!\n",
    "\nSeason 1 of \"Millennium\" featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made \"The X-Files\" look sunny by comparison. Unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a \"murder mystery of the week\" fare. Thankfully the second season, supervised by former \"X-Files\" producers Glen Morgan and James Wong, changed all that. The second season began with the suspenseful \u0027Beginning and the End\u0027, where Frank Black pursues the mysterious Polaroid Man who kidnapped his wife. This episode also introduces the comic relief for Season Two, computer hacker Brian Roedecker.\n\nEven though \u0027The Beginnning And the End\u0027 would fit perfectly in Season 1, the subsequent episodes follow a different path that greatly improved the series. Starting with the second episode, \u0027Beware of the Dog\u0027, and continuing with episodes such as \u0027The Hand of St. Sebastian\u0027, \u0027Owls\u0027, \u0027Roosters\u0027, and the haunting two-part season finale \u0027The Fourth Horseman/The Time Is Now\u0027, we find out that the Millennium Group has existed since the beginnings of Christianity and isn\u0027t nearly as altruistic as Frank Black (and the viewers) originally suspected.\n\nIn addition to the Millennium Group storyline, we also learn more about Frank\u0027s childhood via two holiday episodes: \u0027The Curse of Frank Black\u0027, a Halloween-themed tale where Frank encounters the ghost of a neighbor who committed suicide, and \u0027Midnight of the Century\u0027, an emotional story of Frank trying to mend the relationship between him and his father. In the latter we find out that Frank was not the only one with a strange gift, as his mother was blessed/cursed with the ability to see angels. Lastly the second season even showcased two comedy episodes: \u0027Jose Chung\u0027s DOOMSDAY DEFENSE\u0027 and \u0027Somehow Satan Got Behind Me\u0027. These hours of television are completely different from the average \"Millennium\" episode (to say the least) but they\u0027re still worth a look nonetheless.\nI could continue rambling on and on about the greatness of Season Two, but you\u0027ll really have to buy the DVD set and form your own opinions. The DVD set does come with some bonus features, but the only one of worth is the Season Two documentary \"Turning of the Tide\". The rest of the bonus materials are second-rate at best\n",
    "\nOne of the most maligned movies of 2004 is...not that bad. In a fine example of how critics and Hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it, Oliver Stone delivers an epic take on the life of Alexander the Great. Not up to par with the great Hollywood epics, but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe.\n\nThe incredible life of Alexander the Great is epic movie material if I\u0027ve ever seen any. His rise to ruler of The World by his mid twenties is chronicled here (with noticeable gaps in the timeline). His personal life is just as fascinating as his public one. His decidedly odd family life (as depicted by Stone, anyway) and his lovers (both male and female) are just as integral to the story as his military victories. Perhaps, the ultimate momma\u0027s boy just wanted to be loved.\n\nAlexander is a workable and sometimes fascinating historical epic. It certainly doesn\u0027t deserve the drubbing it got in the press. Wonderful cinematography and a fascinating subject are undermined by uneven performances and some poor storytelling decisions, but there\u0027s a lot to like. I\u0027ll take my history this way instead of as an over sentimentalized bit of claptrap like The Patriot or Pearl Harbor any day. Forget the buzz and check it out. Rent it. If, like me, you find much to enjoy there are plenty of copies on any used DVD rack. Give it a chance and make the decision for yourself. My bet is you\u0027ll find a lot to appreciate.\n",

    "\nSeriously! At the end of Fat Eliminator Minna says \"do this program on a regular basis and watch your body change\". It\u0027s true. I have been doing this DVD and only this DVD for about a month now - 3 days a week is Fat Eliminator and 2 days is Strength and Grace and my body is firm! I have abs now, biceps and definition in my thighs and buns. Extra flab is gone. This is a fantastic workout combination. FE is tough, particularly the first three cardio circuits. Those plyo jumping jacks are killer. Once I get through that third cardio circuit though I feel like I\u0027ve already had a good workout and I\u0027m only halfway through! I work up a sweat - I can\u0027t even answer the phone because I couldn\u0027t talk even if I wanted to. It\u0027s definitely focused on your lower body with lots of jumping and plyo and core work but the circuits are quick and they really do go by quickly. The workout is also fantastic in that just when you feel like you can\u0027t do one more plyo lunge, she changes the pace to something more less impact. The 15 minute Blast The Fat toning section I always add onto the cardio days. It\u0027s nice, quick and effective and in one hour while my son is napping I get in a total body workout.\n\nI also LOVE the Strength and Grace segment. I enjoy alternating my days with this. It\u0027s a perfect combination of relaxing and energizing and I still work hard, just without all the jumping around. My heart rate does get up there and again you do a lot of leg work for those nice glutes and thighs. \n\nMinna is a beautiful woman and I appreciate her demeanor and her physique. There is just something about her that is completely likable. Overall, I am extremely impressed with these workouts - the results I have seen will defintely make me continue these workouts\n",
    "\nThe Movie: One of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90\u0027s, and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved, this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind. And despite the whining from some, usually hardline Christian, corners, it\u0027s not anti-christian at all. What it is is simply great, imaginative and clever film making, and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from Mimi Rogers, ably supported by the likes of David Duchovny, Will Patton and Patrick Bauchau. \n\nI\u0027m not going to go into it too deeply simply because it\u0027s one of those films that should be seen and experienced with as little up front knowledge as possible. \n\n(Please note that I\u0027m not attacking Christians or Christianity above, just a small, but, as usual, vocal closed minded minority that always gets up in arms about any film that dares tackle any such subject with any degree of honesty instead of going down the traditional biblical fawning path. People who will instantly hate a film like this just \"on principle\" and then proclaim to all that they should avoid \"such trash\". You know exactly the kind of people I\u0027m talking about. They\u0027re a minority, they just happen to be a very vocal and closed minded one. And none of that has anything to do with their christianity as much as it has to do with their absolute closed mindedness and their fear of anything that dares stray from a certain comfortable path.)\n\nThe DVD: The good news, this film is finally on dvd, and with a pretty decent audio commetary to boot. The bad news, the movie has been badly misframed, which is something that becomes obvious in a couple of key scenes especially. I\u0027m not sure whether this was done as a form of censorship (as the misframing of one scene does effectively nullify a sequence of any real nudity that it once had) or whether it was just a botched transfer, but it is clearly misframed regardless as I saw this film twice on it\u0027s theatrical run and the framing is different now than it was then. Plus the misframing is quite obvious anyway, and on the audio commentary you can even hear remarks about the film pertaining to parts of the print that are no longer visible due to said misframing (so clearly they were watching the film in it\u0027s proper framing). \n\nUnfortunately this doesn\u0027t appear to be available anywhere else on dvd, so if you want the film on dvd right now this is your only option, just be aware going in, and hope for a better release somewhere down the track. Apart from the framing issue the sound and audio quality are perfectly fine, and the only other notable extra is the film\u0027s trailer.\n\nThe bottom line: A really good, bold, interesting film on a disappointing and variable quality dvd.   \n\nMr J\n",
    "\nThere are many reviews here and I believe in their own way they all are right about this film to some degree.  My main recommendation is to be sure to watch it more than once.  If you do, it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place.  Daniel Day-Lewis once again makes this film.  You feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the \"wrong woman\" (Pfeiffer) after being engaged to the \"right woman\" (Ryder).  He is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film.  Due to circumstances beyond his control, he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman. There is a palpable, underlying  eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair.  \n\nAfter I had watched this film one time, (primarily due to Day-Lewis)I had decided to give it away.  I left it alone for about 2 weeks and then watched it again.  Since then I have watched it several times and I enjoy it more and more with each viewing.  My only real complaint; I hate the blond hair they gave Pfeiffer.  It\u0027s just all wrong for her. Nevertheless, she is so beautiful.  Take the time to watch this at least two times.  If you do, I think you\u0027ll find it\u0027s a keeper\n",
    "\nAfter the original, Herbert West ( Jeffery Combs) and Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot)have returned from medical miltary duty in South America as they return back home as they have perfected their re-agent formula to continue experimentint. But Herbert however gets an idea to collect body parts especially the heart of Cain\u0027s old girlfriend \"Meg\" to create the perfect re-animated woman, however Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) has been re-animated back to life by accident as he still has powers to control zombies and want revenge for what West did to him.\n\nNot as great as the 1985 cult horror comedy masterpiece \"Re-Animator\" but really enjoyable! the acting is kind of average but there\u0027s nice splatter in this movie including a variety of odd re-animated critters like a finger creature with a human eye attached done by Screaming Mad George, David Allen (Puppet Master, Q The Winged Serpant and Young Sherlock Holmes). Like the original movie this has dark humor to propell along with gruesomeness, all in all is that it\u0027s not a bad follow-up but still worth watching.\n\nThis DVD is pratically bareboned with a alright transfer with no trailer! but that\u0027s ok, if you enjoyed the original then you\u0027ll probably like this one as well\n",
    "\nThis show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal. From the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i\u0027ve been a huge fan of the series. I was so sad to hear it\u0027d been cancelled but I wasn\u0027t surprised. It was one of the shows I loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air. Now that the DVDs are out I can relive these 13 fleeting moments in TV that are, to me, some of the funniest things I\u0027ve ever seen. Apart from the hilarious, oddball performances from Michael Michael and David the series was packed with guest stars including Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, and a whole lot more. Really, anyone that is a fan of comedy ala Strangers with Candy will find this funny. It has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts. \n\nFavorite episodes include:\nCampaign\nPaper Route\nCoffee Shop\nNovel\nMeeting Girls\nand\nVegetables\n\nThe extras on the DVD are really top notch including commentary tracks for every episode, a lengthy and interesting \"History of Stella\" and much more. The commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other, giving some insight into the creation process, while remaining pretty well aware their show met with sub-par ratings. They take it all in stride and aren\u0027t too proud to poke fun at themselves. I think if this show had been on comedy central around the time Strangers with Candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons. It\u0027s a shame. Definitely worth getting, turning off your phone, and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season. \"And when I say plow that\u0027s a pun!\n",
    "\nExcellent series.  The court room scene is hilarious.  I am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti Americanism of this series (I refer to the portrayal of the American guest) as well as in Upstairs Downstairs?  In both series, as in other British TV dramas, Americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic.  What about the Henry James/Edith Wharton type aristocrats who toured England in the 19th century?  Mr. Hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them. \n\nWhen will series 2 be released\n",
    "\nIf you\u0027re a fan of vampires, werewolves, action, or gothic suspense, this is probably a movie you\u0027d be interested in checking out. While it\u0027s not a groundbreaking film, it\u0027s a highly entertaining one, and one that, for me, is something I can rewatch several times per year.\n\nThe filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can\u0027t see what\u0027s going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting. (Please don\u0027t mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle.) The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie. And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by \"The Matrix\", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie.\n\nThe only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there\u0027s not a single joke in the entire thing! Everything is so serious and dark that unless you\u0027re in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down...that\u0027s how heavy it is.\n\nAs for the set. The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45-minute documentary \"Fang vs. Fiction\", which talks about vampires and werewolves. It was very intriguing.\n\nIf you\u0027re a fan of this movie and you own the DVD already, I would recommend selling it and buying this version, it\u0027s worth the money\n",
    "\nThis is the best animal movie I have ever seen..from a child\u0027s point of view. This has been our daughter\u0027s favorite movie for the last one year or so (she\u0027s 3 now) and after watching it almost every day (sometimes several times a day) she still enjoys it as much! We\u0027re surprised that even we are not tired of it. The animals are fun to watch, the story is interesting and the music is great. We\u0027ve bought several other animal movies for our daughter and this surpasses all of them. The production is superb, the animals did a great job and it all seems so real.  A must-by for everyone who has small kids\n",
    "\nAs I understand it, \"Police Squad\" was one of the most requested titles for release on DVD.  It\u0027s taken a while for it to happen, but it finally has!  It\u0027s great to be able to replace my VHS tape that I recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a \"Police Squad\" marathon.  Having now watched the DVD, I now know that for almost 20 years, I\u0027ve been watching heavily edited versions of the show.  But not anymore!  \n\nOther reviewers have described the episodes, so I won\u0027t waste time doing that.  Suffice it to say, the show was ahead of its time as it really didn\u0027t become popular until it was made into the first Naked Gun movie 6 years later (and had two subsequent hit sequels).  But I was one of the few who knew in 1982 that it was a clsassic.  I always wondered why the show never worked on TV, but Leslie Nielsen probably explains it best in his interview that is included on the DVD.  He says that you actually had to pay attention and most TV is meant to be watched almost passively while doing something else.  And I think he\u0027s right.\n\nSo it\u0027s great to have these shows.  The extras are just so-so as the interview with Nielsen is too short and I don\u0027t think the commentaries give much to the episodes (especially the one commented on by Robert Wuhl of \"Arliss\" fame, who was a writer for the show).  Wuhl must say a dozen times \"I don\u0027t remember this.\"  Might have helped, Bob, if you took 25 minutes to watch it before watching it for the commentary.  But I won\u0027t trim the rating.  It\u0027s the shows I wanted and have now received\n",
    "\nThe Full Frame version is just that, the unmatted full frame of the filmed image.  The Widescreen version is simply the full frame matted with black bars to fit a wide theater screen (this is how it was originally shown in theaters).  In two spots the DVD lies about the Full Frame version, saying that it\u0027s a Pan \u0026 Scan trimming of the Widescreen picture.\n\n(1) The Widescreen/Full Frame menu screen which comes up when the disc boots up and also when you select \"Video Setup\" from the main menu.  This screen shows a screen capture of a film frame that appears at 19:46 in the movie.  The capture was taken from the Widescreen matted version of the film, and the \"Full Frame\" image displayed is simply a cropped version of the Widescreen image.\n\n(2) The text \"The following film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen.\" which appears before the Full Frame version of the movie is played.\n\nMGM got themselves into trouble for this very same lie on their DVD packaging\n",
    "\nSEASON 1: Wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit, incredible acting for a TV series, and classic plots.  All around a great opening season for a classic show.\n\nSEASON 2: Great story lines, very different plots, thickening of the chemistry between Remington and Laura with lots of cliff-hanger moments.  The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made.\n\nSEASON 3: TOPS the first two seasons.  It\u0027s hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting.  The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great, classic show.  Laura (Stephanie) and Remington (Pierce) are really just starting to get into the groove of their ever-messy, non-relationship, relationship, and Mildred (Doris) is just starting to blossom as an actual \"Gumshoe\".  It is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons.\n\nThe good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them.  I would highly recommend purchasing Seasons 1-3 (because I\u0027ve seen them already), as well as the final set of discs (Seasons 4 \u0026 5), even though I have not yet watched them (I\u0027m trying to drag it out and make the show last longer!).\n\nOne MAJOR down-side (not with the show itself but with the DVD discs) is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs--stopping completly, skipping to the end or back to the beginning, skipping chapters, etc.  One disc will not even play in our computer, which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in Africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax.  It\u0027s too bad that they don\u0027t take more care transfering great shows like this to quality DVD\u0027s for years of non-skipping enjoyment.  The same disc didn\u0027t have as much trouble playing in our actual DVD player once we were back in the States, but still skipped from time to time.\n\nOverall Show Rating: ***** (5 Stars)\n\nOverall Disc Rating: *** (3 Stars) \n",
    "\nDark atmospheric telling of the tale. Very decent! It is a simply told ancient tale. The scenery is gorgeous. There\u0027s a good atmosphere of the barbaric time. It\u0027s a good movie, a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end. \n\nThe movie conjures up thoughts of Gerard Butler as Aragorn, and Ingvar Eggert Sigur�sson as Theodin in LOTR.\n",
    "\ni loved this movie. for those who gave it one star i guess didnt see how well it was done. In the american version all it was..was Sarah Michelle Gellar\u0027s face. The Japanese version was much better (considering it was original and made more sense).\nit has alot of characters in it but not so much that u will get lost in all of them since they usually die or just dont appear until later in the film.It has some twists which are good.The american leaves out soo sooo much. In the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people. In the Japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help.  anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves  Asian horror and likes a good plot and movie!! go see it!! and enjoy\n",
    "\nThis film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it. The plot is not very intriguing, and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life, so it lacks this sense of reality. A dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer, which is exactly the point of this movie. \n\nHowever, this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end, and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute. Elijah Wood is stunning, only due to his efforts can the film get some believability. Caulkin is perfect in this role too, portraying the bad boy, I have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor.  Maybe only comparing to Elijah, but hey, he is widely consirered as one of the most talanted actors of his generation and the most talanted holywood child star ever, so no wonder you cannot compete with him... Anyway, this film is certainly worth watching as a family entertainment and is absolutely a must for Elijah Wood fans!\n",
    "\nIn all fairness, this film is advertized on the package as a \"docudrama\" and not as a drama. The problem is that it isn\u0027t clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its 140th anniversary. As a documentary about the reenactment, this is a fine collection of footage, interspersed with some (thankfully) brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides. (Actually, I thought the actor portraying Longstreet did a fine job -- the others were less convincing.) As a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle. \n\nAs a reenactor, I found it interesting watching the various units on the field. Despite the occassional glimpse of earplugs and sunglasses, the equipment and uniforms appear reasonably authentic. Of course, given the generous build of most of the reenactors in this film the title should have been \"Three Days of Density\" instead. I kid my fellow reenactors...unfortunately most people who have the money to spend on reenacting also have too much money to spend on good food and drink, myself included.\n\nSo, if you want to really learn about the battle, read Harry W. Pfanz\u0027s trilogy or Stephen Sears\u0027 book. If you want to see what Civil War reenacting on a grand scale can be like, this is a fine introduction\n",
    "\nWatching \"Once and Again\" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again.  This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date.  I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them.  Watching \"Once and Again: The Complete Second Season\" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning.  There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family (\"Scribbling Rivalry\").  Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again.  If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through.\n\nIf the first season of \"Once and Again\" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance.  There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., \"Scribbling Rivalry\") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell (\"Edifice Wrecked\"), than there is about them being with each other.  While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, \"Feast or Famine\").  The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well).  So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother\u0027s daughter, which is not always a good thing (\"Best of Enemies\"), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating (\"Food for Thought\").\n\nHaving Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on \"thirtysomething\" all over again.  But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick (\"Ozymandias 2.0\"), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot.  This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live.  But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting (\"Edifice Wrecked\"), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison (\"Won\u0027t Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight\").  When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious.  \n\nThis really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters.  Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun (\"The Other End of the Telescope\"), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby (\"Forgive Us Out Trespasses\").  Judy comes up with the great idea of \"Booklovers,\" despite Lily\u0027s negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck.  Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music (\"I Can\u0027t Stand Up For Falling Down\"), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue.  Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December.  I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation.   So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli\u0027s parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation.    \n\nMy only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental.  At least when she does not immediately accept Rick\u0027s proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring.  The fact that season two ends with the wedding (\"The Second Time Around\") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking \"Once and Again\" was simply about Lily getting remarried.  It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD\n",
    "\nThis was a blast from the past for my husband and I.  We purchased this for our 6 and 7 year olds and they really like it.

    "\ni went into this DVD with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it.  maybe \"enjoy\" isn\u0027t the right word, it is intense, it is political (and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics)and it jumps around from subplot to subplot.  in fact, i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks.  but I found it very plausible. and that is what a good movie should do- give a plausible thesis and play it out.  it succeeds here.  it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence.  Sure, it makes the Gov\u0027t and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them, but that usually makes for a good starting point, since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and/or greed anyway. I once heard a history professor say \" it isn\u0027t about the struggle of good vs evil, it is always about the struggle of good vs good....both sides always think they are right and God is on their side\"..... Watch it, you will come out the other side thinking. \n",
    "\nThis was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all.  It was a very sad day when the election was stolen from Mr. Gore, but this movie gave me a new realization. That being in office would have held this man back. His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious. This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do. Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes. He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info.  If you think this might be too boring for your taste, give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish.\n\nThank you Mr. Gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen\n",

The Ice Age is coming to an end, and Our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for Higher ground before their Valley gets flooded. Manny, along the way, begins to question his own mortality and the fact that He is \"the last mammoth\"...or is he. Well, that what everybody thinks, until they run across a family of opossums.

    "\nWonderful\n\nTerry Gilliam is the Orson Welles of our time.  Lambasted by critics for his excesses, admired by others for his genius.  I\u0027m with the genius crowd.  Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I\u0027ve seen in a long while.  Gilliam\u0027s style is baroque, and by a director who knows the definition.  Visually, this can be quite stunning, as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene.  Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam\u0027s magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas.  It\u0027s 1812, the Age of Napoleon, not a good time for the Imagination.  Nevertheless, con-men Jake \u0026 Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear, since it\u0027s also an Age of Anxiety, and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night.  The bumbling Grimms are played, quite effectively by Matt Damon (who pulls off the accent nicely) and Heath Ledger (a head scratching, eye-squinting success).  Their evil counterparts, End Products from the Age of Reason, are a French general, played by Jonathan Pryce, and his wacky henchman, played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare.  Little girls are disappearing in a small town, and something needs to be done about it.  And the Grimms are caught in the middle.  You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales, as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery.  To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises.  Check it out\n",
    "\n\"Monk\" is quite an interesting show. It is about this character named Adrian Monk (played by Tony Shalhoub, \"Wings\"), who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias. He is also incredibly intelligent; he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly, provided that he has all the right clues. The most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when Monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words, which, for some of the most intense cases, will really shock the audience: \"I\u0027ve solved the case.\" However, for some reason, the best part always seems to be when he says, \"Here\u0027s what happened.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the scenes involving murder cases, it must be known that the antagonists of some episodes can get very, very brutal. They will do things like whack people against the head with crowbars, slice up their bodies with chainsaws, smash their hands with car doors, and sometimes, they will even try drowning them, and like the antagonists of \"MacGyver,\" they are not afraid to use guns, if necessary.\n\nThe acting is phenomenal especially by Tony Shalhoub and Ted Levine (Capt. Stottelmeyer). The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene in each episode. Finally, this DVD is practically perfect in picture and sound quality. It has extras like featurettes and you have the option of listening to it in three different languages; English, Spanish, and French. I found it all interesting. In conclusion, this TV show has it all: good background music, great dialogue, interesting stories, good acting, and interesting cinematography.\n\nThe KAB score: 8.9 super\n",
    "\nI did not see John Carpenter\u0027s original version of \"Assault on Precinct 13,\" but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake. I was paying attention so I knew what the set up was, both inside and out of the precinct, as we went along. But being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in James DeMonaco\u0027s script (I made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters I was sure would survive all the bullets and I was half-right, which is a polite way of saying I was half-wrong). \n\nIt is New Year\u0027s Eve in Jean-Francois Richet\u0027s film and it has started to snow heavily. Precinct 13 officially closes at the stroke of midnight and filling up the last boxes are Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), who has been hiding behind a desk ever since an undercover gig went horribly bad and he was wounded while his two partners were killed, grizzled veteran Jasper O\u0027Shea (Brian Dennehy) who is always talking about retirement, and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) who is always talking about sex with bad boys. Jake would rather talk about sex than his feelings about what happened before with Alex Sabian (Mario Bello), the department shrink who happens to stop by on a snowy New Year\u0027s Eve to take another crack at Jake\u0027s psyche. \n\nThen a Detroit police transport bus shows up with a quartet of prisoners, unable to get to the prison because of the storm and a highway accident. There is Beck (John Leguizamo), who will not shut up, Anna (Alisha Hinds) a girl with a crew-cut who proclaims her innocence, Smiley (Ja Rule), a counterfeiter, and Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), the most notorious criminal in the city, who has just been arrested for murdering an undercover cop under suspicious circumstances. So when a couple of guys with guns break into the precinct and everybody is yelling these are Bishop\u0027s men coming to get get, we do not buy it. After all, as soon as Bishop saw them he hid behind a wall. Things are just beginning to get interesting. \n\n\"Assault on Precinct 13\" is an action film where the human element is really more interesting once Jake figures out that to survive the night he needs everybody to help out, which means not only the prisoners but the women. Everybody gets a gun in this one, but you know full well that not everybody can be trusted with one. Furthermore, Jake is fully aware that Bishop is the smartest and deadliest person there, but this movie is all about making the best of a bad situation that keeps getting worse. The death of one character really puts the way this is going to play out into question, and I liked the note on which the film actually ends once we finally get down to the inevitable confrontation between the two main characters. Not great, but certainly an enjoyable action picture with a minimum amount of stupidity on the part of the characters once you accept the idea the die is cast and it is all or nothing for the bad guys. That is a pretty good recommendation for this genre\n",
    "\nMaybe better than the original. I liked that they focused on Wonka\u0027s childhood throughout the film.  That was something that really added to the storyline.  They really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal, too. I guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original wasn\u0027t anywhere to be seen in this one, but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it. \n\nOh, and the children seemed ESPECIALLY bratty this time, which made it better when those bad things happened to them.  A friend pointed out to me that this version has a LOT more musical numbers.  Good call.  I don\u0027t know if the ending was better than the original, but it was certainly a very good, interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake.  I don\u0027t want to reveal what happens at the end, so let\u0027s just say that when the factory tour is over, and Charlie leaves, there\u0027s still a decent chunk of storyline left.  \n\nI was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of \"living in a world of chocolate\" element wasn\u0027t really there, which is definitely a bad thing.  I mean, come on.  We ALL want a world of chocolate!  I just feel there should have been more chocolate-related things included in the film.  \n\nOverall, it\u0027s probably not better than the original, but it\u0027s not worse either.   You really need to own both. \n",
    "\nHaving seen Stella\u0027s live show in Hollywood, I had a sneaking suspicion that I was going to love their Comedy Central show, and I was not disappointed.  These guys have mastered the art of genius-disguised-as-idiocy, and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end.  I guess I\u0027m not surprised it didn\u0027t last; this kind of humor isn\u0027t for everyone.  But come on...we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include Mind of Mencia and Blue Collar Comedy, both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer.  These guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years, and I hope to see them in another show or movie soon.  Until then, I\u0027ll be enjoying Stella on DVD\n",
    "\n   that is really what a.b.c. said when they took this,the funniest show ever on t.v.,off the air in less than six shows. my friends in high school and i watchedcthis show every time it came on. it was a parrody of all the cop shows from the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s and was falling down funny. later the group who gave us airplane would retool their baby into the \"naked gun\" movies and make a mint at the boxoffice. each show could be watched many times just to catch the jokes you missed. i\u0027m so happy that they have all six shows on dvd now,and i can get rid of the old cut up copy that i had on vhs. and remember \"smoke\", \"yes i know,but what happened\n",

    "\n\"Stagecoach\" is significant, along with \"Destry Rides Again\", for redefining the Western for \"adult\" audiences.  Director John Ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences.  For sure the film does contain a number of Western archetypes(the gambler, the prostitute with a heart of gold, etc.) but they transcend the stereotypes.  \"Stagecoach\" is also significant as the film that broke John Wayne to mainstream audiences.  Wayne\u0027s entrance as the Ringo Kid is the stuff of legends.  There is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated Claire Trevor as the social pariah, Dallas, and Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone, for which he won an Oscar.  The film\u0027s status as being historically significant is not debatable.  As first class entertainment it is timeless\n",
    "\nI watched this movie ...and once it finished I decided I had to log on to Amazon and buy it up.  This film is so well done, from the characters, the actors, the dialogue and the stories.  A pure enjoyment to watch. I hope everyuone sees it at least once\n",
    "\nThis film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted. Occasionally the film lets itself down with it\u0027s editing. I sometimes feel disorientated thinking \" wait slow down will you.\" Having said that - this film is well acted, and really puts you in the Netherlands of the 19th Century. It may not be as hard hitting and exciting as Turkish Delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching\n",
    "\nI love good underrated movies, they make you feel like you\u0027re part of a priviledge club of connoisseurs. I\u0027m not a movie buff, but Deep Cover has all the elements you would expect of a classic : great acting, memorable lines, interesting ( and logical ) plot and a decent ending.\nLaurence Fishburne is at his best in his role of an undercover cop slowly crossing the line between pretending to be a drug dealer and pretending to be a cop. Jeff Golblum is one of those actors you either love or hate, and I loved him playing the dirty lawyer laundering drug money. There\u0027s a great chemistry between the two and the supporting cast, which to me, was one of the main weakness of New Jack City.\nThe use of Laurence Fishburne\u0027s character as the narrator works wonder, and somewhere between the slow, dark wailings of the movie theme, the nightime shots of downtown LA and Laurence Fishburn\u0027s poetic lines, the movie grabs you into a world, an urban jungle, crowded with nightime vultures, heartless killers and hopeless junkies. Deep Cover is somewhere between Fables and magical realism, a place where reality exceeds fiction.\nA great movie, the DVD is so so, almost no extras, and the picture quality is good, without being great.    \n",

    "\nSpider-Man (2002.) The first Spider-Man film.\nSpider-Man 2 (2004.) The second Spider-Man film. \n\nINTRODUCTION: \nIn 2002, the first of the live-action Spider-Man hit theatres. It\u0027s not likely that the film\u0027s director, Sam Raimi, had any idea just how successful his big-screen incarnation of the classic superhero would be. It drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres, and the DVD releases did the same. The sequel, appropriately enough, was even more hyped, and did even better. And now, both films have been combined into a single set! Read on for my review of the Spider-Man films.\n\nSTORYLINE: \nEssentially, this set includes both of the films. The first of the two films explains how Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into Spider-Man. In the first film, the villain is former head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn, who has been transformed into the Green Goblin by a chemical he was testing. The second film continues two years after the first left off, and features Spider-Man facing off against Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body. This time around, juggling the duties of being Spider-Man with work and school have made Peter Parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle. \n\nOPINIONS: \nBoth of these films flat-out rule. Seeing the first film turned me into a Spider-Man fan practically overnight. The acting and storyline are both excellent, particuarly Willem Dafoe\u0027s portrayal of Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Everything the first film did well, the second one does even better. I was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film, since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them - but Sam Raimi does it here. These are great films, and the fact that they\u0027re together in one package only sweetens the deal.\n\nDVD: \nThese are the standard DVD releases of the film, meaning each one has a bonus disc of material. There are a ton of bonus features, including commentary, cast and crew interviews, and assorted other extras too. The second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books, and the plotlines of them! That\u0027s my favorite extra on either of the discs. The other features are also excellent, and if you like the films, you\u0027ll agree they\u0027re worthwhile.\n\nOVERALL: \nI can\u0027t begin to express my satisfaction with these films. The cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece, and I think you\u0027ll agree superhero movies don\u0027t get any better. Being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet. These are must-watch movies, regardless of who you are. Even if you\u0027re not a big fan of the Spider-Man franchise, you may be pleasantly surprised\n",
    "\nI saw this movie for the first time when I was 5.  I\u0027m still watching it at 65.  They will never be another movie to surpass this one\n",
    "\nThe movie was terrific, and the only reason I didn\u0027t give it 5 stars, was because there was quite a bit of Spanish in the film, and the subtites from Spanish to English didn\u0027t seem to work on my copy.   English subtitles appeared for Engliish, and Spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke Spanish!  Strange.  Fortunately I know some Spanish, so i could sort of pick it up, but I don\u0027t know why the sub titles didn\u0027t work. Anyway,  Bogie was very good and the story was too.  Three men set out to find gold, and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey.  Besides all that were the usual bandits and Indians and so forth.  But it kept you watching and that\u0027s what really counts.  Won\u0027t tell you if they got any gold! \n",
    "\nI thought this was a very good film. Well written filmed cast and acted. Very dark humor. I myself would have used Lawyers Guns and Money by Warren Zevon and Knockin\u0027 On Heavens Door, Bob Dylan on the sound track\n",
    "\nThis movie is so touching.  I loved the determination of the girl.  It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve seen this movie so forgive me for not remembering the characters\u0027 names.

I never knew Alfred Hitchcock had such a fun personality and such wicked humor before viewing his little intro\u0027s and exits during each episode.\nThis set includes 39 episodes from the 1956-1957 season.\nThe casts of each show are superb and the certain actors who show up in other episodes are always welcome as the new characters they play.  \nIf you love short, play-like drama\u0027s (some are comedy\u0027s in a dark vain) you owe it to yourself to check out both season sets and join me and others who hope that the studio\u0027s will quickly release all of the seasons for us fans.\nPeace  :o\n",
    "\nWhat can one add to what\u0027s already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time? \"Citizen Kane\" has been analyzed more than any other movie, in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as \"Kane\" itself. It\u0027s therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary \"The Battle over Citizen Kane\" and the HBO film \"RKO 281.\"\n\nI\u0027m amazed at how many people I encounter who have watched \"Citizen Kane\" once and thought it was just OK.  But seeing it once is simply not enough. This is true of any great film, but more so for \"Kane,\" a multifaceted work that cannot be fully digested upon first viewing. In many ways, \"Kane\" is the Bible of modern cinema: you\u0027ll find something new each time you watch it.\n\nOrson Welles\u0027 astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman\u0027s wizardry. Welles\u0027 Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.\n\nThe expertly produced documentary, \"The Battle over Citizen Kane,\" recounts the factors that nearly prevented Welles\u0027 film from seeing the light of day. But it belabors the comparison between Welles and Hearst. Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter. By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles\u0027 career tanked after \"Kane,\" the documentary glosses over Welles\u0027 achievements. Welles went on to make several great films, two of which (\"Touch of Evil\" and \"Chimes at Midnight\") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to \"Kane.\"\n\nWhile the documentary overdoes the comparisons between Welles and Hearst, \"RKO 281\" distorts the relationship between Welles (Liev Schrieber) and \"Kane\" co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (John Malkovich). Mankiewicz was holed up with Welles\u0027 Mercury Theatre partner John Houseman - not Welles - at Victorville, and Houseman was Welles\u0027 confidant throughout the \"Kane\" controversy, not Mankiewicz.  If the film simplifies real-life relationships, it remains an enjoyable - if somewhat lightweight - re-enactment of the controversy, with great performances by James Cromwell as the imperious Hearst and Melanie Griffith as the ditsy Marion Davies.\n\nBack to the inevitable question: is \"Citizen Kane\" the greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though \"Touch of Evil\" might be even better among Welles\u0027 own films. But \"Kane\" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. \"Citizen Kane\" has topped the highly regarded \"Sight and Sound\" polls since 1962, and the American Film Institute reinforced \"Kane\u0027s\" #1 status with its 1998 Top 100 list. Can all the critics, experts, and film buffs all be wrong? Watch \"Citizen Kane\" - not once, but twice or more - and decide for yourself\n",
    "\nFred Astaire plays a dnacer returning to England from a trip abroad.  In the Customs shed he meets Ginger Rogers in an embarassing predicament.  He tries to find out who she is, but she refuses to tell him, and he spends ages searching London for her until he finally tracks her down and begins to awaken her interest.  Ginger goes down to Brighton with her friend dithery much-married Alice Brady, and Astaire and his dithery lawyer friend Edward Everett Horton go in pursuit.  Ginger has gone to Brighton to try and obtain a divorce, she intends to spend the night with a professional co-respondent.  Somthing Astaire says makes her think he is the co-respondent, which puts her right off him.  Fortunately the real co-respondent, a diminutive Italian, turns up (\u0026quot;your wife is safe with Tonetti,he prefer spaghetti\u0026quot;) and the mystery is sorted out.  But what will happen when Ginger\u0027s husband arrives the next morning?  will she get her divorce.  This is a wonderful film, with a silly but extremley funny plot, and some wonderful dialogue, particularly between Horton and Brady, who somehow manage to end up married to each other, much to their surprise.  An absolutely delightful film\n",
    "\nThis DVD set was outstanding.  The 5th and 6th seasons of Seinfeld were at the height of the show.  Great extras!\n",
    "\nThe Legend of Zelda: Complete Animated Series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children\u0027s cartoon should be, right there with \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\" \"Street Sharks,\" and \"Recess.\" The Legend of Zelda was (and still is) such an exceptional video game series for all ages, and the TV show followed in its footsteps. It combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy one-liners, and some jokes that still today make me laugh. \"Lookin\u0027 good, Princess! \u0027Specially from THIS angle!\" As children we see Link yell that to Zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences. But later, that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee, and wonder how we ever missed it before.\n\nBut the series is most enjoyable for those of us who faithfully stuck to the actual video game series. The implimentation of original 8-bit sound effects into the cartoon is an added bonus that draws us back for more. And waiting to see which classic Zelda enemy will cause Link and Zelda trouble next is just that much more fun (especially if you can name them).\n\nBut by far the most fun thing about this show is waiting and praying for the day when Link can coax a kiss out of the lovely Princess. And they\u0027ve come so close it almost made me angry when they got interrupted. Link tries so hard, and makes such an idiot out of himself trying, that you\u0027d think he deserves a little action once in a while. but every time, no matter how he tries, he either messes up or is interrupted by Ganon\u0027s non-stop attempts to steal the Triforce.\n\nAll in all, if you grew up with te Super Mario Super Show, and you\u0027re a Nintendo fan, you\u0027ll appreciate this show as much as you love to watch it\n",
    "\nThis is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor \u0026 I really enjoyed watching it.  I think it has great replay value \u0026 as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness.  I found it more reminiscent of the old 60\u0027s films like \u0027Monte Carlo or Bust\u0027 or \u0027Those Magnificent men....\u0027.  Jackie Chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action-packed foil to \u0027Fillius Fogg\u0027 played with brilliant English reserve \u0026 self-deprecating humor by \u0027Steve Coogan\u0027.  There\u0027s no comparison to the original \u0026 the film doesn\u0027t even try to copy.  Rather, it takes a silly story with silly character\u0027s puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family action/adventure/comedy movies you\u0027ll see.  Because this isn\u0027t a typical \u0027Martial Arts\u0027 vehicle for \u0027Jackie Chan\u0027 I found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline.  Check out for instance the fight-scene in the Art-Gallery which goes to show why \u0027Jackie Chan\u0027 is probably the best Action/Comedy star in the world right now. There\u0027s much that\u0027s Chaplain/Keaton-like in his performance \u0026 all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts. The guest-stars are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices, most notably \u0027It\u0027s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\u0027 (What I think is the best Comedy ever \u0026 this is by no means a comparison).  Anyway \u0027Arnold Swarzenneger\u0027 in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a Turkish Prince no less (Possibly the poorest Arabian impression ever, which is of course why it works so well) and \u0027Rob Schneider\u0027 has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice.  Miss \u0027Cecile de France\u0027 is a beautiful Comedy foil \u0026 manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent \u0026 I hope to see more from her.  You might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but I found a lot of it to be nicely restrained, this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set, check out the extras.  All in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy/Action/Adventure with ne\u0027er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing.  \n",
    "\nThe main character, Lebowski, is a bum of a person living in Los Angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Suddenly Lebowski\u0027s life is changed when he is mistaken for another Lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters.\n\nThe plot evolves as many other Coen movies (Raising Arizona comes to mind) as we are introduced to more-and-more colorful characters and the plot gets more-and-more outrageous, yet somehow still seems real.\n\nMy favorite component of this film is the character played by John Goodman, a Polish Viet-nam veteran who converted to Judaism after marrying his ex-wife. He has a hair-brained plan to help Lebowski extricate himself from the mix-up mess and he doesn\u0027t bowl on Shabbos. He also baby-sits his ex-wife\u0027s Pomeranian when she goes out of town. \n\nIf you liked Raising Arizona you\u0027ll want to watch this movie over and over again\n",
    "\n\"The Dude, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or, uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you\u0027re not into the whole brevity thing.\" Those are The Dude\u0027s immortal words he used to introduce himself to the other Jeffery Lebowski. You\u0027re probably thinking \"What is he talking about, who is the other Jeffery Lebowski?\", well I\u0027ll tell you in just a moment, I\u0027ve just got some things to clear up first. Joel and Ethan Coen have made some of the most loved films of all time, and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making duos/team of all time. These fellows bought you the cult favourite Blood Simple, the hillarious Raising Arizona, the decietful Millers Crossing, the crazy Barton Fink, The Hudsuckers Proxy, and the blood drenched Fargo, and now this, one of the finest films they\u0027ve done, The Big Lebowski. Jeff Bridges is Jeffery Lebowski or in this case, The Dude. John Goodman plays the Vietnam veteran Walter, Steve Buscemi is not in it too often, but he plays the loveable Donnie. Let\u0027s just go through the character sketches(only The Dude\u0027s bowling pals).\n\nCharacters:\nThe Big Lebowski\u0027s main character is The Dude, he lives in LA, he listens to Creedance Clearwater Revival, his favourite drink is a white russian, and he loves bowling. The film is set in, as we\u0027ve established before, Los Angeles. The Dude is an average joe slacker who dresses in, as what you could say, \u0027the hippie who likes to surf clothing\u0027. Sandals, shorts, crummy old shirts, jersey jackets(jackets that are jerseys),he never wears socks with his shoes(even in bowling shoes) and occasionly, glasses. Let\u0027s  also not forget his long hair that makes The Dude\u0027s image so legandary. The Dude\u0027s bowling buddies are Walter Sobchak, and Donny. Walter is a Vitnam veteran and refers everything to nam\u0027. He mostly wears shorts, a shirt with a sleeveless jacket, hiking shoes, socks(obviously), and always, and I mean ALWAYS wears his aviator sun glasses. He also has sort of an army man buzz cut with a beard around his mouth. Donny, is a great bowler, whenever we see him bowl, he gets a strike, except for once later on(don\u0027t want to spoil anything). That\u0027s all we bassicly know about him except that he usually(when bowling) wears long pants, a bowling shirt tucked in and a haircut where is hair isn\u0027t too long or too short. He\u0027s a nice guy and is usually told to shut up by Walter because of his late involvement in conversations with The Dude and Walter.\n\nThe plot:\nThe movie kicks off with a man narrating. He has a Texan accent and talks about a man named Jeffery Lebowski who also goes by the name \u0027The Dude\u0027, and is the supposed storyteller of The Dude\u0027s story, but doesn\u0027t narrate until later on. As he narrates we see The Dude in a grocery store in his sandals and the previous statements I made of the clothes he wears, he\u0027s looking at milk and tests one of them to see if it\u0027s sour, he later arrives home with his purchased milk but is surprised by two thugs, they dunk his head in the toilet and are telling him to give them the money that Bunny owes them. They later realise that it\u0027s not the Jeffery Lebowski they\u0027re after, they\u0027ve soiled The Dude\u0027s rug and they eventually leave, but The Dude wants to get to the man who they were supposed to get, this is the other Jeffery Lebowski I was talking about and is the millionaire Lebowski, he\u0027s bassicly the title\u0027s name \"The Big Lebowski\". The Dude pitches up at the millionaire\u0027s mansion and attempts to get a free carpet in exchange for what the thugs were supposed to do to The Big Lebowski\u0027s carpet. He eventually get\u0027s what he wants but is then later called by Jeffery Lebowski to drop off money to kidnappers who kidnapped his trophy wife Bunny. To cut this short, the film is about The Dude trying to get Bunny back to Jeffery Lebowski, and how he has to deal with other problems that Jeffery Lebowski has, because people come looking after him because of the same name he shares with the millionaire Lebowski. The drop off of the kidnapping leads to all of his other problems. Walter is told about the ransom money by The Dude and decides that The Dude and himself should keep the money instead, because Walter thinks that Bunny kidnapped herself. Walter gives the kidnappers a bag full of dirty laundry that he had, so they keep the money in the car when they go bowling, as they come out, his car is gone. So they have to get the money back without Jeffery Lebowski knowing.\n\nThe film is hilarious, but that doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s just a normal movie, it\u0027s stunnig. The dialogue is sharp and witty, although there\u0027s alot of swearing, that doesn\u0027t mean the humour is just fowl mouthed, it\u0027s hillarious, some of the lines go down in history as some of the funniest one liners ever. The Coen\u0027s writing here is as good as ever, with excelently written and thought out characters. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are absolutely hilarious, they\u0027re definately the funniest characters in this movie(Jesus is also funny), and make you wish the film would never end. The other things that are worth watching the film for are the acid trip sequences and the absolutely incredible vintage rock soundtrack.\n\nThis is a comedy lover\u0027s dream come true. If you love the Coens and excellent snappy humour then this is a must have for you. even you don\u0027t know the Coens too well or even comedy, then here\u0027s a film too start with. Just buy this now, or soon, or whenever you have a split second of a chance to buy it.\n\nI can\u0027t tell you what the special features are on this disc, because I have the region 2 edition. This one most probably has the same trailer my one has. So if it\u0027s the same as the region 2 features, then it\u0027s got absolutely no good special features worth writing about\n",

My favorite line from the movie is when Keith defends Amanda, claiming, \"You can\u0027t judge a book by its cover.\" Watts cynically replies, \"Yeah, but you can tell how much it\u0027s gonna cost.\" Finally Watts agrees to help Keith prepare for the date, including helping him \"practice kissing\" - and it\u0027s a doozy of a kiss.\n\nThrow in John Ashton as Keith\u0027s father, Maddie Corman as his meddlesome sister, and Elias Koteas as the scary guy Keith befriends in detention, and you have a \"wonderful\" movie\n",
    "\nBased on historical events which are still poorly undertsood, this movie depicts Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr - the titans of quantum mechanics in its halcyon days during the 1920s and 1930s - caught in an encounter which is a loose human analogy to Heisenberg\u0027s famous uncertainty principle (which demonstrates mathematically that you cannot know both the exact speed and position of a single electron). Drawing from the Tony Award-winning play by Michael Frayn (who also wrote Noises Off), the movie revolves around the dialogue between these two men (sometimes together with Bohr\u0027s wife) who meet in Copenhagen in 1942 when Heisenberg, the German, who has been placed within the scientific research progam of the Nazis in their quest to build a nuclear bomb, visits his mentor and colleague Bohr, the Dane who is living through Nazi occupation of his native land. There are deep unresolved questions about the motives of Heisenberg which the characters try to resolve in a series of talks and walks through the same park where the two physicists previoulsy stolled to debate the ideas which came to form the foundation of quantum physics. Set against a piano score which resonates with the inner sense of uncertainty and suspicion in the dialogue, the movie achieves some the things that the big stage does not allow, including flashbacks and scenes ranging back and forth between the park and Bohr\u0027s home. [Note: I enjoyed the movie as much as the play]. In an era where cinematic palates seem titillated mostly by fast action thrillers, this movie is another example of how well constructed dialogue makes for gripping cinematic drama when it goes hand in hand with superb casting and performance\n",
    "\nI enjoyed the first season and got it. Eagerly awaiting season 2. See it for sale overseas in the UK but not here? Tough waiting so long...sigh. I can do other formats besides North America but it\u0027s a pain. C\u0027mon guys, I\u0027d rather spend the money here.\n",
    "\nThe Grapes of Wrath is a great movie, perhaps one of the best I have ever seen. However, having read the book, I notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out. By taking out these crucial, yet quiet scenes; the movie has a faster pace than the book.\n\nIn the movie, Grandpa died suddenly. The only explanation for his death was that he had a stroke. In the book, the preacher, Casy, explained to the family members that the old man could not leave his land, his home and his way of life. Casy explained that Grandpa was spiritually dead when he left his house, and it did not take long for his body to also die. This shows the great sacrifice that the Joads must make in order to survive. In the movie, it just seems that they pack up, leave, and arrive, without any moral dilemmas. Grandpa dies in another family\u0027s tent, not just on a blanket by the road. This is important because in the book it symbolizes the way people have to help one another in times of need. \n\nIn the scenes in California, the pace slows down a bit, so I can feel the details of the book surface in the movie. With the events leading up to Casy\u0027s death crisp and clear, I could understand his death as brutal murder, and Tom\u0027s speech about him carrying on Casy\u0027s work beautifully taken from the book. I really loved these scenes, because unlike most of the movie, these scenes do remain true to the book, and because of that, they are full of detail, and you can see the hand of Steinbeck at work.\n\nDespite all of these forgotten scenes, the Grapes of Wrath is one of the best movies of all time\n",
    "\nWhy does title always seem to be ommitted from any bond collection release? Connery in a remake of Thunderball....  Is this not a relesae by the same production company?  It is a MGM release, so why doesn\u0027t it ever get included?  Any light that can be shed would be greatly appreciated..\n",
    "\nThere simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than Frank Gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work.  He has both his passionate lovers and haters.  I am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle.  I really love some of his work, while I find some of his work to be quite off putting.  The person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of Gehry\u0027s work, art critic Claude Jencks (the person who popularized the term \"postmodern\").  Jencks, for whose deceased wife Gehry designed a memorial building, states bluntly that Gehry has made some ugly buildings.  I think with Gehry more than most architects, one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition.  Whatever else one may say about Gehry, he isn\u0027t like other architects.\n\nOne reviewer below called this a \"puff piece,\" but that isn\u0027t really correct.  It is more correct to call it a conversation with a friend.  Gehry asked his close friend, the mainstream director Sydney Pollack, to make a documentary of his work.  The result is a fine portrait of Gehry\u0027s career.  Pollack certainly does not criticize his work, but interestingly he does not over praise it either.  They do call attention to the fact that many simply don\u0027t like his work and the film contains numerous excerpts from one of Gehry\u0027s more vociferous and respected critics, Hal Foster.  But the point of the film is not to provide an objective and critical overview of Frank Gehry\u0027s work.  The point is to get to know Frank Gehry and some of his ideas about architecture.  In this the film succeeds marvelously.\n\nIf one watches a number of documentaries about architects, one thing that is striking is how many of them are enormously likable individuals.  For every irascible Frank Lloyd Wright there are ten you\u0027d love to sit down and have a beer with.  Much like I. M. Pei, Frank Gehry comes across as an immensely likable guy in this film.  Perhaps away from his friend\u0027s camera he is an implacable tyrant, but those qualities, if they exist, are not apparent here.  Instead, he comes across as a genuinely nice guy.  In fact, a couple of the individuals interviewed stress that as laid back as Gehry is, he really does have an ego.  I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever heard a person in the creative field have anyone insist that appearance aside, they really do have an ego.  In the vast majority of cases, that is all too apparent.\n\nI found it interesting to see the shots of Gehry and either of his design partners working with him on designs.  If you are accustomed to think of architecture as akin to drafting, watching Gehry work is a bit of a shock.  He doesn\u0027t design so much as sculpt.  He and his partners look like a couple of extremely mature kindergartners with scissors and paper as they cut, bend, shape, snip, and play with variations on the model they are struggling with.  There is apparently little or no concern with the particular materials to be used.  He seems rather to struggle with the kind of overall shape, with the assumption that with today\u0027s materials any kind of design can be turned into a reality.  The film really brings out how Gehry\u0027s own conception of architecture is much closer to sculpture than to engineering.\n\nAs a resident of Chicago, a city noted for his importance to twentieth century architecture, it has been amazing to realize how little of his work has been done here.  In fact, apart from his controversial (what else?) work in Millennium Park, I\u0027m not aware of anything else he has done here.  As a result, I have less direct experience with Gehry\u0027s work than many other leading architects.  I must confess that much of what I see appears to be fascinating.  I would, for instance, absolutely love to see his Bilbao museum.  But there is one aspect to Gehry\u0027s work that I really applaud:  its emphasis on individualism.  One criticism of much architecture has been its essential conservativism.  Much of it espouses nonegalitarian and conformist values.  One sees exceptions, such as Louis Sullivan\u0027s refusal to put box seats in his Chicago Auditorium design.  If one looks at a Gehry design, it is hard to imagine it ever becoming the style of choice of a repressionistic, totalitarian regime.  It is too individualistic, too anarchic for that.  Even such a free spirit as Louis Kahn still designed the capitol of Bangladesh.  But it is simply impossible to imagine Frank Gehry designing a capitol.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I came away from it with a greater liking for Frank Gehry as a person than I had anticipated.  And perhaps I will in the future be more inclined to appreciate his designs.  He may not be the greatest of our architects, but he certainly is one of our more likable free spirits\n",
    "\nWe LOVE these movies!  They entertain the child as well as the adult!  We went through a period where we watched these every night before bed!  Much better than the Baby Einstein Collection!  We\u0027ve made this our designated baby shower gift!  Everyone should have a copy!  They are good for parents as a stress relief.  You don\u0027t even need to watch them, just have them playing in the background, the music is absolutely wonderful.  I love when I catch my kids humming the music as they are playing.  Perfect for any age, boy or girl!  Thank you HBO\n",
    "\nI loved the movie it has a lot of hidden symbols, like Almodovar is accustomed to doing.  However, the music was the best\n",
    "\nWarner has been doing a magnificent job of using the latest picture resolution process to restore and/or polish up their best movies; and again they do not disappoint! Warner Home Video truly hits a home run and does the incredible with this boxed set of five of the greatest musicals of all time! The set is well presented with excellent digital transfer, wonderful sound and a bevy of sublime extras.\n\nThe Band Wagon (which itself is a two DVD special edition) stars Fred Astaire as an older entertainer trying to be successful again in show business. Things do not go well: he doesn\u0027t like the director; there aren\u0027t fancy dance scenes that he prefers to perform and he has to dance with a ballerina! The show is unpopular and Fred\u0027s character Tony Hunter saves the day using his superior technique and know-how. The extras are wonderful! Liza Minnelli (whose Dad, Vincente Minnelli, did an excellent job as director of the picture) and Michael Feinstein provide an engaging commentary. There are also two documentaries: \"Get Aboard! The Band Wagon\" about the making of the movie and an older expose entitled \"The Men Who Made the Movies: Vincente Minnelli.\" You won\u0027t regret these-they are excellent and very informative! SMILE There\u0027s also the outtake musical number of Two Faced Women. Very good! For Astaire fans there\u0027s an Astaire trailer collection and even a musical short of Jack Buchanan with the Glee Quartet. I was particularly pleased with the fine commentary Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein give here.\n\nThe other two disc special edition is of the MGM classic Easter Parade. Wow! This has always been one of my very favorite musicals. The acting and the chemistry between Astaire playing the professional dancer and Judy Garland playing Hannah Brown his at first unlikely dance partner-and eventually romantic partner-is nothing short of excellent and captivating! Ann Miller turns in a great performance as the dancer who leaves Fred\u0027s character to try to get even further ahead in her career. The digital quality of the video and the sound are both excellent. There\u0027s a documentary of the making of this movie and a particular favorite of mine is the American Masters documentary profile: \"Judy Garland: By Myself\" put out only with the essential effort of my friend John Fricke. (The American Masters documentary won more than just one Emmy, making this a particularly valuable extra! John won one of the Emmys for this; he is the leading Garland biographer who wrote several books on Judy.) John worked so hard on this profile! John\u0027s fine commentary along with Ava Astaire (Fred Astaire\u0027s daughter) proves to be an excellent resource for reliable information about this film and Judy. You also get the outtake musical number \"Mr. Monotony.\" There\u0027s a Judy Garland trailer collection and some promotions for the original film are provided. Wow! A fine two disc set in and of itself. \n\nBells Are Ringing is Judy Holliday\u0027s last performance; she plays a worker at a telephone answering service who gets overly involved with her client\u0027s personal lives. Jean Stapleton, a favorite actress of mine (from All In The Family as Edith) is in this picture as well. This picture was nominated for an Oscar for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture and the song \"Just In Time\" is certainly one good reason why! Outtake musical numbers include \"Is It a Crime?\" and \"My Guiding Star.\" The digital transfer is again excellent and the sound quality is excellent. This is definitely a classic musical.\n\nBrigadoon boasts a wonderful musical score by Lerner and Lowe. The principle cast is only the best: Gene Kelly, Van Johnson and Cyd Charisse. An adventurous American suddenly uncovers a magical Scottish town which is only visible one day a century! Does he stay there and perhaps experience a fine true love; or should he return to his life as it is? Quite the dilemma! There are three musical outtakes you want to look at: \"Come to Me Bend to Me,\" \"From This Day On,\" and \"Sword Dance.\" An audio outtake and a brand new digital transfer make this a fine addition to the box set as well as your DVD collection.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is Finian\u0027s Rainbow. A wonderful fanciful musical, this film stars Fred Astaire in his final full length performance as Finian McLonergan. Somehow Finian steals a pot of gold from Og the leprechaun. Finian and his daughter Sharon (the lovely Petula Clark) go to America (as does Og) and use their powers to overcome a rather prejudiced senator. Not only are the musical numbers excellent; the cinematography is superlative and the ending is a happy one! There is an excellent commentary by director Francis Ford Coppola and a cute feature on the film\u0027s premiere. \n\nAll in all, this is clearly one of the best boxed sets of supremely fine great musicals and it is very reasonably priced. For me personally this set was an easy decision-it is already in my personal DVD collection! I highly recommend this boxed set for fans of the great American musicals as well as all patrons of the arts. This is also a solid introduction to some of the quality musicals produced on film to date. Equally important, the hard work and effort everyone put into the seemingly countless extras is superlative. \n",
    "\nThe Great Dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director, Charlie Chaplin. The movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of World War 2 and at the rise of the Nazi party. The similarities between dictator Adolf Hitler and the comedic genius that is Charlie Chaplin is quite interesting: both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year, same month, in the same week. Chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing Hitler for this film; he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film. \nThe Great Dictator has the ability to tug at your heart and make you laugh until you cry. The music is gorgeous and the writing is superb. Though some scenes do drag a bit, most of it flows smoothly. \nPerhaps the most famous scene in the movie is the final speech given by Chaplin. It is just him staring at the camera, and nothing stops him from saying what he feels.\nMovie buffs have to see this film. The Great Dictator is a beautiful presentation that showcases the cinema genius of Charlie Chaplin\n",
    "\nEvery film in this collection is a gem. Annie Hall and Manhattan are both top notch, followed by Bananas, Everything you wanted to Know about Sex, Sleeper...heck, even Interiors was such a radical departure its worth seeing at least once or twice. But to me the real diamonds in the rough of this set are Stardust Memories and Love and Death. These two films are probably Woody\u0027s least talked about, but really, I think they are both fantastic films. Love and Death is full of the witty one liners and pratfalls that were prevelant in his \u0026quot;earlier, funnier\u0026quot; works... but you can see in the dialogue of Love and Death that Woody was maturing. And Stardust Memories, my favorite Woody film. This film says so much for anyone who fancies themselves an \u0026quot;artist\u0026quot; who is trying to figure out what they want to say...and how to say it. Maybe my one beef is the lack of extras on these DVD\u0027s... but for the money, you can\u0027t beat the price of this set\n",

    "\nHal Hartley never fails to entertain, never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level.  Simple Men is no exception.  The seemingly simple plot - two brothers in search of their missing dad - provides so much room for character growth that I wish there were an entire series of films centered around them.  \n\nWith a hard-edged view of the world as: \"There\u0027s no such thing as adventure. There\u0027s no such thing as romance. There\u0027s only trouble and desire\" (actually from a Fritz Lang movie of the 1920\u0027s) there\u0027s plenty going on to both prove and disprove Hartley\u0027s ambivalent theories.\n\nSimple Men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious Elena Lwensohn.  In one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50\u0027s beatnik-style dance to Sonic Youth\u0027s \"Kool thing.\"  Then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number.  \n\nMany dismiss this film, and Hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point.  What is amazing about Hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that, once seen, reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane.  \n\nSimple Men is pure cinematic delight.  \n\nHooray for Hartley\n",
    "\nNot being familiar with yoga, I chose this DVD because of Rodney Yee\u0027s reputation and the low cost.

I\u0027ve purchases two other titles in the series, Power Yoga - Strength and Power Yoga - Stamina, and I switch off each workout.  Some of the moves are more difficult than others, but it gives you something to work up to.  If I couldn\u0027t do a stretch, I would go as far as I could and hold it. It was a great feeling when I was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly I was unable to do.

    "\nWhen Daryl Deever (William Hurt) tells TV reporter Tony Sokolow (Sigourney Weaver) he knows more than he actually does about a murder in the building where he works as a janitor, he gets more than he bargained for. Deever is a good guy, smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms. He\u0027s sort of engaged to his best friend\u0027s sister, but he\u0027s had a crush on Sokolow for two years. When the man in the building gets his throat slit, Sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene. Deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her, so he tells her he may know something. She goes after the story and he goes after her. Sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated, capable man known as Joseph (Christopher Plummer), who is good friends with Sokolow\u0027s parents. It becomes clear that her wealthy parents, their rich friends and Joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for Jews to escape from the Soviet Union and to journey to Israel. And it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement, too. Before long, the man\u0027s associates learn of Deever\u0027s gambit with Sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing. More lethally, the real murderer learns of what Deever said to Sokolow and believes Deever might actually know something. He goes after Deever.\n\nThis is a tight, well constructed murder mystery with two first-rate components. First is the romance which builds between the characters played by Hurt and Weaver. These two people are attractive and smart. Hurt, in particular, comes across as guileless but he\u0027s no one\u0027s patsy. The two are very likable. Second, the situation which develops poses some ethical questions. Grades of gray come into play; it wouldn\u0027t be accurate to say that the murderer is simply another bad guy.\n\nThe movie also features some first-rate actors besides Hurt and Weaver. There\u0027s Christopher Plummer who, as usual, brings so much assurance and nuance to his role; James Woods as the best friend, always a little off balance; Pamela Reed as Woods\u0027 sister; her mutual declaration of non-love with Hurt is very funny and appealing; Steven Hill and Morgan Freeman as the two cops assigned to the case; Kenneth McMillan as Hurt\u0027s father, angry and vulnerable; and Irene Worth and Albert Paulsen as Weaver\u0027s parents, people who love her but, especially the mother, always put responsibilities and obligations into the love.

The main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect.  While trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him.

You can tell there\u0027s a lot of influence from American film noir in this film, but \"Le Samourai\" takes it to a level of perfection.

    "\n SPOILERS\n\n When Star Trek\u0027s production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season, they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold The Cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode. The result: One of the most important and brilliant Treks ever done!\n\nEveryone knows the basic plot by now: Spock kidnaps his crippled former Captain, and hijacks the Enterprise, and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all The Federation. He eventually is court-martialed en route, and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the Enterprise\u0027s visit to Talos IV 13 years prior. \n\nTHIS is the episode which cements Spock\u0027s character forever: the supposedly emotionless Vulcan, who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans. Leonard Nimoy\u0027s performance is one of his best as Spock : initially seeming as though Spock had gone crazy almost, kidnapping Pike, using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under \u0027secret orders\u0027, all sorts of indications SOMEthing must be wrong with Spock...until after the Talosian\u0027s plan is revealed,where it is found THEY have been manipulating events all along, and Spock returns to his stoic self.....except..when leaving the briefing room with Pike for the last time, his head bowed, shoulders slumped.\n\nShatner\u0027s understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles. I say :\u0027unfair\u0027...Frankly, it is PERFECT for the events - all during these events, Kirk acts rather stunned at all these events: His friend and 1st Officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship, he almost dies going after him in a shutle, THEN he is releived of command for all of this! By the time the Talosians supposedly abandon Spock and forces the trial board to take a vote, even Kirk is convinced Spock should be put away.But..at the end..is able to smile when the Talosian shows him the \u0027rejuvenated\u0027 Pike happy again at last.\n\nAll of these performances are directed with care by Marc Daniels, the veteran TV director who was at the helm of the \u0027envelope\u0027. They make an deliberate  point of cutting to the more mature, unemotional Spock during the famous \u0027laughing\u0027 scene,and you can ALMOST see a flicker of \u0027was I THAT emotional?\u0027 cross his face!\n\nThe makeup used on Sean Kenney, the \u0027substitute\u0027 Captain Pike (Jeffery Hunter was unavailable),might be some of the best ever done for any Trek: it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage: you are totally convinced this is an older, horribly maimed Jeffrey Hunter! \n\nSome small parts of The Cage are cut: some shots of Pike\u0027s fellow \u0027zoo-mates\u0027, some VERY sexist lines about \u0027women on the bridge\u0027, and the obligatory \u0027aliens running through the computer\u0027 scene. None of these are very important to the plot of EITHER the pilot or the envelope. \n\nAnd just to add some trivia: \n\nPart II of The Menagerie was the highest rated episode of Star trek ever in prime time! \n\nActor Malachi Throne had been the original voice of the Talosian Keeper in the pilot. Since he was cast as Commodore Mendez, voice artist Vic Perrin was dubbed in as The Keeper.\n\nAs per the Director\u0027s Guild, Marc Daniels was credited as director for Part I, while the director of The Cage, Robert (Mr Pilot) Butler, was given the screen credit for Part II.\n\nThe Menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish!\n",

    "\nAll Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty)\n",
    "\nEverybody knows the plot of this movie. So, I can\u0027t add anything in that respect. However, I can tell you that the quality of the DVD is very good. Clear picture and sound - great buy\n",
    "\nA very good film staring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Cary plays the part of a retired jewel thief. Someone begins to steal jewels and the local police think its Cary. Grace plays the part of the daughter of a rich Amrican widow. The film then covers how Cary Grants  finds the people who have copied his MO.A fun romp through the French country side. Well acted and directed. A must see if you are a Cary Grant or Grace Kelly fan.\n\n                                                  jame\n",
    "\nIn the movie Some Like It Hot its a great movie and its genre is comic and lovely.It takes place in Chicago and in Forida.This movie is about two musicians that accidentallywitness a gangland shooting and then they the other people wanted to killed them. Morover they two musicians Joe(Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon)decide to go to Florida to participate to a girl jazz band. The problem is that they cannot go as boys so they decide to dress themselves as girls and to present themselves as JOsephine and Daphne. in they way to Forida they meet a lverlorn singer that is Marilyn MOnroe.Their plan is perfect until  Josephine falls in love with Marilyn Monroe. Then at the same time a old man falls in love with daphne and wants to engage her.\n\nOne conflict that the movie has is when the old man tries to engage daphne but she told hin that they can\u0027t marrie and she gievs a lot of excuses to him and he says that it doesn\u0027t matter that he would forgive her. in addition at the end she says to him that she is a man and he asnwers him that is ok that nobody is perfect. I think that was a good conflict because eventhough she try to get away with it he accepts her without having a problem.The usual is that he wouldn\u0027t accept her bor being a man, but that didnt matter to him.\n\nThe character in this movie are really good actors all of them had a great actuation.The only thing that was different is that the gangster got killed and i think they didnt have a good acting. all the sets wre good except for the one that i just talk about. The lightning in the movie was very creative it was very good, the costumes wre really nice and everyone dressed great in the movie.\n\nThe music the movie has was ok too because it goes with the type of the movie. I had never seem a movie like this and i think it may relationate with the real life where people does this kind of things. I recomend this film to all the people that want to have some fun and entertain themselves with something good like this movie.\n",
    "\nWhat a truly stunning film, this type of film has been long overdue in the movie industry, more of these should see the light \n",
    "\nThis film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters.  However, its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful, the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences, and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul.  Although I have recommended this film to several people, I caution them that it can be pretty disturbing.  I thought about it for weeks after I saw it the first time, and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again.  Definitely not a \"light hearted\" evening of entertainment\n",
    "\ni own many of the 50 packs of movies and i must say i like this set very much.most of these movies are from the 30\u0027s and 40\u0027s, the hayday of movie mysterys. the transfers are ok ,but not great and some of the movie have sterotype\u0027s of all kinds. just keep in mind when they were made,and if they bother you don\u0027t watch. a nice set and a great way to build your movie collectio\n",
    "\nIntroduction\n\n3 Games to Glory III is a two-disc video compilation of the 2004 New England Patriots playoffs, including their Super Bowl victory over the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 in Super Bowl XXXIX.  This Super Bowl victory was the Patriots third in four years, marking them as the team of `00s.  For New England Patriots fans it\u0027s a chance to relive the glory of back-to-back Super Bowl victories and three championships in four years.  Non-New England Patriots fans probably would not particularly enjoy this in-depth video. \n\nMain Features\n\n3 Games to Glory III provides extensive highlights of both New England Patriots\u0027 playoff wins and Super Bowl victory after the 2004 season.  \n\nThese playoffs found New England once again schooling the Indianapolis Colts in yet another year where Peyton Manning and the vaunted Colts offensive choke under playoff pressure.  The high flying Colts offense was throttled by the superior schemes and tough play of the Patriots in a 20-3 AFC Divisional Playoff win at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. \n\nThis is followed by New England\u0027s dramatic defeat of the Pittsburgh Steelers, 41-27, in the AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.  The Patriots entered this game as decided underdogs to the 15-1 Steelers after being throttled by Pittsburgh earlier in the season.\n\nFinally, you get to enjoy the extensive highlights of New England\u0027s impressive 24-21 win over the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles.  This is yet another game where New England\u0027s superior execution and stamina in the later stages of the game brought them ultimate glory.  The Super Bowl was played in Jacksonville, Florida on February 6, 2005.\n\nThe highlights of each game are very extensive and seem to cover nearly every play.  They are also mostly well done, but frankly the highlights often fail to capture the real drama of the game.  Of course no highlight reel can match the excitement and drama of a live contest, but there are times when key turning points of the game really just become another quick hit in the video.  \n\nThere are a few disappointments in this video though and it\u0027s not quite as well done as the preceding 3 Games to Glory II (covering the Patriots playoff run and Super Bowl victory after the 2003 season).  First, there is not as much pre-game drama and preparation presented in these videos compared to last year.  Secondly, there are not as many close up, on the field shots that bring the game right into your living room.  It\u0027s much more distant and not as close up as previous editions in this series.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, it\u0027s still great to relive a great season through these videos.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe bonus features on this edition of 3 Games to Glory are not nearly as good as the ones on 3 Games to Glory II.  The bonus features are nice they just didn\u0027t live up the standard in the previous edition.  Following is a brief rundown of what you\u0027ll get on the DVD.\n\nThere are some \"Bill Belichick\" breakdowns of key plays for each game but there are very few of them and really leaves the viewer wanting more.  \n\nThere\u0027s also a \"Points After: Sounds of the Game\" which shows post-Super Bowl press conference features, but again, it\u0027s really short and leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe \"Patriot\u0027s All Access\" which appears along with each of the playoff and Super Bowl wins shows locker room scenes and practices, team meetings, and other shots of players as they prepare for games.  These are pretty well done short features that add a great deal to the video.  \n\nThe \"All Access\" section for the Super Bowl of course included pre-game plane trip, post game party and the parade.  I find these a bit boring frankly, but I guess it\u0027s nice to see the players up close on their daily routines.\n\nThe Super Bowl Highlights are shown twice, once with the regular commentary and once with commentary from Rosevelt Colvin (LB), Ted Johnson (LB), and Matt Light (T).  Matt Light is a funny guy and this was more entertaining than the one last year.\n\nI thought the best bonus feature was one on Disc Two called \"Views from the Past\" with interviews with three great players from previous decades - Gino Cappelletti of the 1960\u0027s, Michael Haynes of the 1970\u0027s, and Andre Tippett of the 1980\u0027s and 1990\u0027s.  This conversation was mostly about comparing this current Patriots\u0027 team with teams of the past and how the game has changed over the decades.\n\nFinally, the video has the 2005 playoff roster, Super Bowl stats, and 2005 game by game results - just like you can get in any book, it just shows it printed on the screen.\n\nOverall, while all these bonus features are nice, 3 Games to Glory III is not nearly as good as 3 Games to Glory II.  It did not include an extensive behind the scenes segment on the Super Bowl, which I found fascinating on the previous edition, nor did it have highlights for each game of the regular season like the previous edition.  I found the lack of these too items very disappointing as I thought they were outstanding editions to last year\u0027s disc.  \n\nNevertheless, the bonus features overall are nice, just nice as nice as last time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAll New England fans should enjoy reliving a third Super Bowl win through this highlights package.  It\u0027s mostly well done and certainly brings back great memories of a great season.  Those who are not Patriots fans I am sure would find the video quite boring.\n\nDisclaimer:  I am a die hard New England Patriots fan and am totally biased in this review\n",
    "\n..Well..at least its in my top 5 \u003do)..I\u0027m not the biggest Chaplin fan.more of a Keaton and Lloyd..kinda guy..But dang if this movie dosen\u0027t do me in everytime..I never fail to fall into hysterics over the \"Feeding Chair\" Scene..or the Gibberish song..and several other scenes.and I always get teary eyed over the plight of Charlie and his little love Gamin..This movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next!...Don\u0027t be botherd by the hype about this being a social commentary..or a Commie film or whatever!..Its still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order!!....Now I have this wonderful new 2 disc Mk2 version from the Chaplin Collection box to pull out every Christmas Holiday season..along with City Lights..as I\u0027m want to do..and Check out the little Cuban documentary on the second disc about the Traveling projectionists who take the Movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first time..The Tears in these peoples eyes as they watch..tell you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film\n",
    "\nIt have a plenty range of Glould\u0027s legacy. Personally I hate the contemporary music, honestly I bought it because it have one interpretation of the magestic Partita No.6 in E minor. It have a rear romatic influence, and definitly it don\u0027t have the same perfection with the greatest baroque influence that Glenn leave us in the one recorded in 1957. Nonetheless you will see the great personality of Glenn and its lively interpretation\n",
    "\nIf you can get through David\u0027s boot camp video with moderate effort, this video may be a bit too easy for you.  That said, this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser.  David does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form.  He is very encouraging throughout.  The workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used (two dumbbells needed).  There are a few innovative moves thrown in as well.  \n\nSince the difficulty level of any workout video is relative, I\u0027ll give a quick background of myself - I run 4-5 times a week, for a total of 40+ miles/week.  I also lift weights 2-3 times a week, incorporating plyometrics and compound movements.  I\u0027ve personally found David\u0027s boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using 5-lb dumbbells and think this one-on-one video is great for days I have less energy.  Regardless of fitness level, you are sure to enjoy this workout.  If you need to make it more intense, use heavier weights.  The biggest thing to remember about David\u0027s style (in my opinion) is to really *focus* on every repetition, *focus* on the muscle being worked, and *focus* on isometrics (contracting the muscle without movement - eg. pushing against a brick wall is isometric).  Hope this helps\n",
    "\nI was reading some reviews of \"The Quiet Man\" earlier this year. And a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time, entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children, grandchildren and I imagine great grandchildren.\n\nIn that league of the timeless you have to put Ben-Hur, a story of love, redemtion, compassion, revenge, retribution, foregiveness and tranquility, in an epic truly larger than life. If we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago, then certainly William Wyler\u0027s third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view.\n\nFor me, seeing it again and again, I am always startled by Mr. Heston\u0027s skills as an actor, often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence. Here the antagonist is Stephen Boyd, Judah Ben-Hur\u0027s best friend from childhood, now addicted to the narcotic of power. The two will clash; this is the time of Christ\u0027s ministry. Christ is seen as a rabble rouser and Rome, an international giant the world had never seen, seeks to thwart that message by girding up Jerusalem. So they send the now goal oriented and vicious Messala to the home of Ben-Hur.\n\nHeston is also supported ably by Jack Hawkins, a brilliant actor in his prime, as the Roman Counsel Quintus Arrius. Judah Ben-Hur, sentenced to virtual death on the Roman Galleys, survives a battle with the Macedonians to only save Quintus Arius. \n\nI say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene, the arrival of Quintus Arrius in Rome, a hero, with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman, Judah Ben-Hur. William Wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as Jack Hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before Ceasar there must be 100 steps! And the camera back away to see Hawkins in his magenta robe, draped over the pure white stairs, climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire. In \"Spartacus,\" also a fine movie a few years later, the script tells you about the size of the Roman empire. Here in this one scene, Wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word.\n\nAt the same time, Judah Ben-Hur, remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs, looks around and in that one expression on Heston\u0027s face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century Rome, he amplifies the scene of Hawkins climbing the staircase.\n\nA great, great move. Well worth your time if you have never seen it. Well worth your time again if you have. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur\n",
    "\nThis is an outstanding DVD.  I highly recommend it.  If you have seen Riverdance live you can relive the great moments.  If you haven\u0027t seen Riverdance live you are in for a real treat with this DVD from the comfort of your own home\n",

    "\nFor those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired, all I can say is that you won\u0027t be disappointed.  This series is one of my all time favorite TV shows.  When I discovered it was on dvd I snapped it up right away.  The picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version I originally saw.  This is the first TV series I have ordered on dvd and I was afraid the picture quality would be vhs.  Boy was I wrong, this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd I have ever purchased.  If you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series\n",
    "\nMy kids just love this movie; Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses.  It is a very clean movie.  It is not scary except for the mean Duchess; but she really isn\u0027t scary, just mean.  It teaches about honesty and family, and how they care about each other; which is really good for children to see.  Plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch\n",
    "\nBefore we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, and over-sugary. However, I have been pleasantly surprised.\n\nYes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccarine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including \"12 Dancing Princesses,\" was significantly higher than I had expected. They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music. On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven\u0027s pastoral symphony, or The Queen of the Night\u0027s aria from Mozart\u0027s magic flute, and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (\"Magic of Pegasus\" and \"Mermaidia\" respectively.) \n\nThe soundtrack to \"Twelve Dancing Princesses\" is mostly adapted from some of Mendelsohn\u0027s best work, including \"A Midsummer night\u0027s dream\" and the Scottish and Italian symphonies. It also includes a lullaby sung to the King by the 12 princesses which was based on a 16th century anthem by Byrd, the recording of which was sung beautifully by Melissa Lyons and the Women\u0027s Occidental Glee club.\n\nThe story is loosely based on the children\u0027s story. \"Barbie\" plays \"Princess Genevieve\", the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed King (e.g. seven young women, plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6.) Like the original, the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing, sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night. However, in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the King their father, who loves them very much, but his cousin, Duchess Rowena, who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor. At first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was ...\n\nAs with many of the Barbie films, comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters. In this case Princess Genevieve has a pet cat, and the evil Duchess Rowena has an equally evil pet monkey, Brutus. The hero, who in this version is the royal cobbler, Derek, has a pet parrot, who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated Indian accent. (That\u0027s Indian from the subcontinent, not native American.)\n\nThose people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them. And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I\u0027m not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality, but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is, that is a concern with this film.\n\nBut on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour\u0027s rest after doing so. Alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won\u0027t be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring. And best of all, the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it\u0027s own\n",

    "\nA French coming-of-age art film that I rented while on vacation.  Despite rave reviews all over the packaging, this story of two moody teenage girls growing apart as sexuality enters their lives seemed pretty slow and predictable, even a bit tedious.  Jet lag set in and we gave up two-thirds of the way through the film, and took it back the next day. In all fairness, this is probably a fine film if you\u0027re in the mood for Serious Art, but I found it a bit dreary\n",
    "\nThis is a really scary movie.  I\u0027ve always put Ju-On on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever, but this movie surpasses that movie.  I didn\u0027t expect much, seeing the title of the movie which doesn\u0027t sound scary at all, but was I wrong, dead wrong.  If you are a horror fan, you got to see this movie.  The terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends.  Cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck.  Asian horror movies don\u0027t rely on gore, but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops.  Contemporary American horror movies don\u0027t scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks.  Asian horror movies like this one, which is Korean, is not an original idea, but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better.  Other Asian titles I recommend are Ju-On, Dark Water, and The Red Shoes\n",
    "\nA fun musical comedy, THE TROUBLE WITH GIRLS isn\u0027t the usual Elvis Presley film but it\u0027s completely charming with it\u0027s faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast.\n\nPresley plays Walter Hale, manager of the traveling \"Chautauqua\" tent-show, circa. 1927, who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show.  Hale finds himself falling in love with Charlene (Marlyn Mason), organiser of the children\u0027s activities; whilst trying to help local single mother Nita Bix (Sheree North) when she murders her nasty married boyfriend (Dabney Coleman).  Presley\u0027s numbers include \"Swing Down Sweet Chariot\" and \"Clean Up Your Own Backyard\".\n\nIt\u0027s certainly a lot better than some of the other Elvis films from the same period; and seeing Elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat.  Marlyn Mason, probably one of Presley\u0027s most formidable leading-ladies, is stunning (and her rendition of \"Sign of the Zodiac\" is a knockout).  Nicole Jaffe (as the amorous hotel clerk), Vincent Price (eccentric speaker \"Mr Morality\"), John Carradine (as a colourful Shakespearian actor), Joyce van Patten (disgruntled former channel swimmer Maude) and Edward Andrews (as Hale\u0027s beleaguered assistant) are also fine.  Fans of classic TV shows should keep an eye out for Anissa Jones (\"Family Affair\") and Susan Olsen (\"The Brady Bunch\")\n",
    "\nI really enjoyed this movie.  Death Warrant was filled with supense and action. Jean-Claude Van Damme portrays officer Louis Burke who goes undercover to investigate murder and corruption in the prison system. Eventually officer Burke meets up with a convicted murderer that he had arrested and put behind bars. \n\nI did not lose interest with the nonstop suspense and action.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRenee Ra\n",
    "\n\"Fargo\" is a very good film. The Cohen Brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film. The film stars Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) as a car salesman in dire need of money. When he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom, things go from bad to worse. I couldn\u0027t help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers. The father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom, and decides to act on his own. Jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess. Moreover, he has a saavy police chief (McDormand) on the case. \n\nThe film is a definite black-comedy, as many of the Cohen brother\u0027s films are. This one is a bit more disturbing than usual however. Hot on the case is a policewoman, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand). She is witty and intelligent and knows something is not right. Steve Buscemi stars as one of the kidnappers, and his partner has a few loose marbles. The film is a delightful [at times funny] film that is highly recommended. Moreover, there are many colorful and funny character actors in the film, which only enhance the films appeal. There are also some disturbing scenes, however, the film is well worth the watch and purchase. Highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5\n",
    "\nI thought the film was great, it has a interesting storyline. It also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on.\n\nI don\u0027t understand why people will rate this movie so low. Is it cuz it doesn\u0027t have a pre-Hollywood established actress/actor in it? That it isn\u0027t some mainstream unoriginal film, which even the most moronic of morons can grasp?\n\nListen don\u0027t rate this movie low if it doesn\u0027t seem good to you, because it requires thinking unlike the mainstream cookie-cutter films in the theaters. You stay to your pablum un-original mainstream films, and leave those people who work hard on indie films alone.\n\nFor the people who complained the girls were dressed too little, I\u0027ve seen many more hollywood films where women wear nothing but string bikinis basically. These girls were dressed for a majority of the film.\n\nFor the person who said Ashley was \"plump\", you must really like your women to be Anorexic\n",
    "\nI did this workout for the very first time today and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve felt ever felt this good about myself. This DVD works. It\u0027s not high impact aerobics, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever sweat that much in one workout before. And I totally disagree with whoever said the breaks every twenty minutes makes you sleepy. I\u0027m not in very good shape, so I need those breaks to be able to do the entire workout (I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d like this DVD because it is one of the longer ones Ana and Ravi put out). I am really, really looking forward to getting the other two Fat Free DVDs to add to my collection\n",
    "\nI think this is a great film.  Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it\u0027s running time (128 minutes), insisting it\u0027s too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint\u0027s films (the ones he\u0027s directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn\u0027t PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn\u0027t have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn\u0027t real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes. \n\nCheck this film out.  It\u0027s worth all of its 128 minutes.  \n\n",
    "\nRecently realizing that Jackie Chan and Jet Li are about done with movie making for the most part, I always wondered if there was anyone who could take over.  Chan and Li are one of a kind and the best out there.  Fortunately, Tony Jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own.  The first thing I like about Tony Jaa is he is an expert in Muay Thai fighting, something new and original for the good guy in a movie.  The next thing I like is that he fights like Jet Li and does stunts like Jackie Chan, though once again he adds his own originality quite often.  \n\nOng Bak is pure action excitement - don\u0027t expect a deep story and do expect horrible English dubbing that is just down right annoying (you can still switch to subtitles with Thai spoken if desired).  If these 2 things don\u0027t matter to you, this movie just plains rocks.  Its a bit slow here and there, but overall it is filled with all the action you could want - illegal club fights, an incredible club brawl fight, tons of stunts and chases, a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars, a ring fight, and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts, lasting for a good 10 minutes.  I also liked the background music for the movie - lots of smooth laid-back hip hop beats.\n\nI\u0027m pleased to say that with newcomer Tony Jaa to the world of martial arts films, the loss of Chan and Li someday soon won\u0027t be as bad.  Ong Bak is brilliant action and originality. The only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing, which Chan and Li movies do much better\n",
    "\nA friend of mine told me about this movie and I went to the local video store and rented it. CRAZY!!! I thought that the CGI and wire work was so smooth that it almost looked real. However, after watching the special features of him doing the stunts from the movie LIVE!! Jackie who??? Bruce what?? Jet whatchamacallit ???? He is the martial arts star for the new generation.  For those that see the decline of martial arts movies, this kid gives us  hope\n",
    "\nA hilarious movie, made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you\u0027d find in the object of it\u0027s spoofing, \"Top Gun.\" The film is loaded with Abrahams\u0027s usual sight-gags, puns, slapstick, and quick wordplay. There\u0027s always something going on in the background, making for fun repeat viewings. The overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience. Besides that, it\u0027s educational, too! You\u0027ll never again wonder what a chafing dish is\n",

    "\nThis DVD was better than I could have asked for. It uses footage from the tv show This Week In Baseball [TWIB], and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of America\u0027s Pastime. It goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including Tim Hudson, Ryan Dempster, select Phillies players, \u0026 many others, as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as Tommy Lasorda and Yogi Berra. If you love TWIB\u0027s \"How \u0027Bout That\" section of the show, you will adore this DVD.\n\nAs far as I can tell, every major league team is shown, though some have the spotlight on them more than others. This is a must have for any baseball fan. It\u0027s by far one of the best MLB DVDs released in a long time.\n",
    "\nThis is a sad little gem of a movie.  I really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love. The story had as much to do with issues of identity, community, and fidelity.  In my opinion, there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved, especially when considering the quality of the performances.  The slight quiver in Weisz\u0027s voice was right on target as was Perez\u0027s accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable. Considering the type of story and the setting, I can\u0027t help but think that a three-part mini-series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film.  I emerged from watching the movie with a feeling  that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character\n",

I was the butt of all the jokes at the office too. \nI already had a closet full of VHS tapes and a few DVDs, I\u0027ve spend hundreds on my local \"golf pro\" and I\u0027ve been reading magazines for years, but I just never could figure out the what, where and whys of my game. A friend recommended this set so I got one and it\u0027s been GREAT. I could easily understand and follow alone with the tips so well that I must have watched all the tips in one weekend.  And after only a few rounds I could finally start to understand what\u0027s going on with each drive, approach and putt I hit and that\u0027s helped me improve enough that my friends are playing with me again. \nIn my opinion anyone would find these DVDs helpful. Even my local \"golf pro\" would benefit from this collection. However, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll give away my new edge to all my \"friends\". At least until I can cut a few more strokes and they have to play catch up.\n",

    "\n    *TALES FROM THE CRYPT THEME MUSIC PLAYS, AS THE CAMERA SHOOTS THROUGH A SPOOKY HAUNTED MANSION. THE CAMERA REACHES THE BASEMENT, OUT POPS THE CRYPT KEEPER WITH HIS MENACING CACKLE* \"TALES FROM THE CRYPT\". This show is one of my all-time favorites. I used to sit in front of the television with my father every Saturday night when this  show came on. The stories in this show were so amazing and so well done, that I couldn\u0027t help myself when I became hooked on the show, and I was only four-years-old when this show debuted with its first season back in 1989.\n\n     TALES FROM THE CRYPT takes you on a journey through six horrifying episodes, each one scaring you in one way or another. This here first season only includes six episodes, but all six are very terrifying, and many ways, rather comical as well.\n\n#1: THE MAN WHO WAS DEATH (aired June 10, 1989)\n   This spook-tacular episode shows a man named NILES (played by William Saddler, who would then go on to take the male lead role in the first-ever TALES FROM THE CRYPT motion picture entitled, TALES FROM THE CRYPT presents DEMON KNIGHT), who has spent the last twelve years of his life shooting electricity into prisoners, sending out their life sentences. But now, a law has been passed to ban the life sentence, for even executing murderers and law breakers is \"Still Murder Within The Eyes of God\". Niles then appears in a few court cases where the defendants happen to be let off the hook, despite the fact they are indeed guilty. This leaves Niles to privately execute the defendants, where it leads Niles into his own arrest, where is then in for a \"Shocking\" surprise.\n\n#2: AND ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE (aired June 10, 1989)\n  In this chilling Holiday-filled episode, a woman murders her husband in cold blood on Christmas Eve. As she tries to bury the body outside in the freezing cold snow, she neglects to hear on the news that an escaped mental patient as broken out of the sanitarium, and has already killed four women in the county. The news has even stated that the patient has been seen wearing a Santa Claus suit, a suit he had stolen from one his victims. The mental patient stumbles upon this woman, practically killing her, but she seems to have killed him by stabbing him in the stomach. As she gets a hold of the police on the phone, she is told by the police to look around for a weapon to use, since she has informed the police that the patient has gotten up and entered her house, after she stabbed him the stomach. She goes into the closet to get her gun, but the door locks. As she pounds on the door, trying to get out, the patient climbs up to the woman\u0027s daughter\u0027s bedroom, with the daughter thinking that\u0027s it the real Santa. She busts through the closet and finds her daughter safe and sound, holding \"Santa\" by the hand, with her mother screaming at the top of her lungs.\n\n#3: DIG THAT CAT...HE\u0027S REAL GONE (aired June 10, 1989)\n   In this brilliant episode, ULRIC (played by Joe Pantoliano) comes across a seemingly mad scientist, who gives Ulric an offer he can\u0027t refuse: Have the gland of a cat inserted into his brain to give him the ability to resurrected after he is killed. The surgery goes successful, where Ulric becomes a classic act at the county fairs. He has been drowned, shot in the heart with an arrow, electrocuted, and many more. But he just kept coming back from beyond the grave. Here is now about to pull his next death stunt: being buried alive for twelve hours, and then resurrected. But...wait a minute. Ulric has already died and been resurrected...nine times.\n\n#4: ONLY SIN DEEP (aired June 14, 1989)\n   In this sexy and beauty-filled episode, SYLVIA (played by Lea Thompson) is a 21-year-old hooker, looking to quit the business and clean up her act. She does so with the money she has robbed from her pimp...after killing him. She goes into a pawn shop to have her pimp\u0027s jewelery, but the pawner reveals that the jewelery isn\u0027t worth crap, for the jewelery is \"hot\". But he\u0027s willing to pay Sylvia $10,000 for her \"beauty\". He informs her that if she wants her beauty back, she has to get it back within a four-month period. Okay, whatever, you old whack-job. Sylvia goes through with the pawning of her beauty and goes out on her way with her 10 Gs. She meets a playboy and begins dating him. Four months go by and Sylvia begins seeing some odd changes in her complextion. She goes to a dermotologist, but he cannot seem to figure out what is wrong, where it is then and there that Sylvia figures out that the pawner was not kidding. She demands her beauty back, but the pawner will only sell it back to her for...$100,000. She kills her playboy boyfriend, and scrapes up every piece of jewelery he ever bought her. She gets her beauty back, which was formed in a plaster-of-paris head of her own self, but it ends up being smashed to pieces when one of Sylvia\u0027s hooker friends bumps right into her, not recognizing Sylvia, for she has become so hideous, like an old, disgusting haggard witch.\n\n#5: LOVER, COME HACK TO ME (aired June 21, 1989)\n  In this ciller, Charles has found Peggy, the perfect girl. Peggy has found Charles, the perfect man. The two have married, against the wishes of Peggy\u0027s aunt. On their way to their honeymoon, they are stranded into an old house, where they have to succomb into spending their wedding night in this disgusting old house. Peggy wants her wedding night to be perfect, so consumating their marriage on the sofa is not a good idea. Comsumating their marriage in a bed is much better. They do their thing, and they both fall asleep, where Peggy says in a sort of joking way that they\u0027ve made a child, a little girl. Charles falls asleep, but he wakes up to the sound of Peggy entering the house with another man. He watches his own wife screw another guy on the sofa, where they guy falls asleep, while Peggy tells him of how they\u0027ve just conceived a child, a little girl. She then picks up an axe, leans over to the man\u0027s ear and simply says, \"Peggy would make a great name for our little girl, wouldn\u0027t it?\" She swings the axe and kills the guy she just had sex with. Charles wakes up in horror, for it was only a nightmare, but it was a nightmare about a true fact: Peggy\u0027s mother had killed her Peggy\u0027s father on their wedding night, after they had consumated their marriage, where her mother and father had just conceived Peggy that very night. Peggy\u0027s mother said she did it to consume the perfect love to a perfect wedding night. But Charles claims that he didn\u0027t marry Peggy out of love. He married her for her money, and he was going to murder Peggy that very night, report to the police that an accident had happened, where he would inherit the money, but Peggy has made a change in plans: continuing her family tradition, which is: Murdering her husband to consume the perfect love on the perfect wedding night, after consumating their marriage, which led into the conception of their daughter.\n\n#6: COLLECTION COMPLETED (aired June 28, 1989)\n  In this lame episode, Audrey Lindley (the actress best known for her role as HELEN ROPER on Three\u0027s Company) plays a lonely housewife, who\u0027s husband named JULIAS has just retired. One the first day of his retirement, her husband is already going crazy because of all the animals his wife has in the house. She continues to claim that she does not want to get rid of the animals because they are her \"friends\", they\u0027ve kept her company all those years her husband had spent working, instead of paying more attention to his own wife. Days go by, and the house is seeing less and less of the animals. Julias then shows his wife where all the animals have gone: in his basement...stuffed. The last animal to be taken care of is a cat, but Julias\u0027 wife bashes his skull in. But the next afternoon, she is sitting in the living room with Julias, talking to him as if he were still alive. Their friendly next-door neighbor drops by, where he discovers Julias\u0027 stuffed body.\n\n    This was a great season. But stay tuned, Boils and Ghouls. There\u0027s plenty more terrifying tales to come in the following seasons *CRYPT KEEPER\u0027S CACKLE\n",
    "\nVisually \u0026 aurally this is a feast!  Great musicianship, excellent lighting, colour, camera angles etc etc.   If you know \u0026 like Pat \u0026 know the piece you won\u0027t be really disappointed BUT the reason it\u0027s 4* \u0026 not 5* for me is a combination of 2 things relatively insignificant in themselves but together worth knocking off a star.  First, there\u0027s no intro (the first note is struck with the title screen still showing) \u0026 no pictures of the band standing \u0026 taking the crowd\u0027s ovation (the credits start rolling straight after the last note);  I always find it nice to get a sense of the atmosphere, location \u0026 occasion before AND after the music starts playing.  Second, those familiar with the piece will be aware of the extraordinary guitar/trumpet interplay closing out Part Two; well, I\u0027m not sure if this is in the playing or sound on the night or the dvd mixing but as the sound builds the trumpet dynamic gets a bit lost \u0026 all you really hear as an individual voice is the guitar synth - great of course but could\u0027ve been even better!  This said, 4* for a Pat product still means a \"must buy\"!\n",
    "\n\u0027The Bunker\u0027 is one of three films that deal with Hitler\u0027s final days as the Soviets encircle Berlin and put an end to the Third Reich in April/May 1945.\n\n\u0027The Bunker\u0027 is both one of the best and one of the worst of the three (the others being 1973\u0027s \u0027Hitler: the last ten days\u0027 and 2005\u0027s \u0027Downfall\u0027) at the same time.  The triumph of \u0027The Bunker\u0027 is Anthony Hopkins tour de force performance as Hitler, at times so exact it is as if you are watching a newsreel.  The element that makes the film almost painful to watch is that almost a 1/3 of it is dedicated to the whitewashing of convicted Nazi war criminal Albert Speer.\n\nOne thing that makes \u0027The Bunker\u0027 different from the others is the occasional use of flashbacks, and although brief they do allow Hopkins to portray Hitler in different venues and in a relaxed mode, casually chating and enjoying the company of friends when times were fat.  In the bunker itself Hopkins turns Hitler purple in a full throttle rage as he yells about the need to destroy \"the scourge and pestilence of Jewish Marxism!\"\n\n\u0027Hitler: the last ten days\u0027 does a bit better than the rest in portraying the supporting cast of characters in the drama but one stands out in \u0027The Bunker\u0027 and that is Michael Lonsdale as Martin Borman, Hitler\u0027s personal secretary and gatekeeper, a man of considerable power who plays his cards close to the vest and is always scheming to stay one step ahead of his rivals.  Despite its flaws \u0027The Bunker\u0027 earns a high rating as the Hopkins performance simply cannot be missed. \n",
    "\nthis is a fantastic video. I use it regularly for teaching. It gives a wonderful \u0026amp; sophisticated view of chuck close as an individual and an artist, as well as a glimpse of the other artist\u0027s work who are interviewed in the video. It is filmed in a very immediate and personal style. There is nothing stiff, boring, or disconnected about it, common faults of many art videos. Anyone who has experienced a similar tragedy in their family will find the discussion of chuck\u0027s \u0026quot;event\u0026quot; very moving, and not at all sappy\n",
    "\nBergman first introduced us to Johan and Marianne in his 1974 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage, one of the cinema\u0027s most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect.  Bergman and the splendid Scandanavian actors Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann took us through Johan and Marianne\u0027s marriage, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliation.  In the end, they live apart, but still make room for the bond between them. \n \nThree decades later, Bergman, Josephson and Ullmann have given us Saraband, a late-life gift.  Marianne decides that even though she hasn\u0027t seen Johan since the 1970s, it\u0027s time to make contact again.  Johan has inherited money from an aunt, and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake.  She literally wakes him with a kiss, but soon enough Marianne\u0027s fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in Johan\u0027s family.\n\nHenrik, Johan\u0027s son, is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter Karin.  Both of them still mourn Anna, Henrik\u0027s wife and Karin\u0027s mother, who died two years before.  Henrik, a music teacher, is preparing Karin, an accomplished cellist, for her conservatory entrance exams.  The elderly Johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic (not unlike Bergman\u0027s own father) and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him.  Henrik wants his father\u0027s affection and acceptance, even though Johan refuses to give it, ostensibly due to some slight by Henrik when he was 19 years old.  In a painful scene, Henrik goes to Johan to ask for money to help Karin, and in his 61 year old face, we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father.\n\nFor Karin, her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father.  Karin struggles to figure out what she owes Henrik, what she owes to the memory of her mother, and what she owes to herself.  She lets Marianne see some, but not all, of the turmoil she\u0027s going through.  For Marianne, her attraction to Johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him.  She\u0027s always wanted something from him, but since she can\u0027t define what it is, she\u0027ll probably never get it.\n\nThe struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by Marianne\u0027s opening and closing monologues.  Karin makes her choices.  Henrik reacts.  Marianne throws herself once more against Johan\u0027s emotional aloofness.  As he\u0027s done throughout his brilliant career, Bergman brings it alive through artful dialog, perfect dramatic timing, and riveting cinematic composition.  The characters are not always likable, but they are never less than engrossing.\n\nThe Criterion\u0027s DVD includes a mini-documentary of Bergman making Saraband.  We watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking, kid around with the crew, poke and prod his actors into position.  It\u0027s a treat to watch him work.  One wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from Julia Dufvenius, the fine young actress who plays Karin.  One also wonders why Bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he\u0027d announced he was through.  \n\nBergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection.  Apparently he wants to say one last thing about it, which seems to be this:  after all the tears and shouting, all the posturing and cruelty, all the reaching out and pulling back, this is what remains:  marriages of true minds (the photo of Anna used in the film is a picture of Bergman\u0027s great love, his deceased wife Ingrid); the fraught ties of fathers and sons; memories of old loves; what you give and get from children; and the devolution of the flesh.  None of it is easy, the master tells us, but all of it is necessary.  In the end, it\u0027s all you have.\n\nWhat\u0027s truly sad is that Bergman, sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey, claims that he\u0027s done.  He did for film what Shakespeare did for theater, took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving.  He will certainly be missed and he can\u0027t be replaced.\n\nBut don\u0027t see Saraband for nostalgic reasons.  It\u0027s a moving, insightful film that deserves a place in the director\u0027s canon.  Saraband stands on its own, but it\u0027s a deeper experience if you watch Scenes from a Marriage first.\n",
    "\nThe enduring legacy around Fran�ois Truffaut\u0027s emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from Henri-Pierre Roch� semi-autobiographical novel. And in showing that elusive rapport, Oskar Werner, Henri Serre and especially Jeanne Moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the French New Wave. Fortunately, the two-disc Criterion Collection DVD set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic, although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times.\n\nThe story focuses on the friendship between two writers, an Austrian named Jules and a Frenchman named Jim, kindred spirits who enjoy a decadent lifestyle in pre-WWI Paris. Inspired by a statue of a woman\u0027s face with a most enigmatic smile, they agree that they are destined to fall in love with a woman with the same smile. Enter Catherine, as seductively capricious a free-spirit as ever there was in cinema, and the two men are instantly enamored. Jules is intent on marrying her, even though it\u0027s clear from the outset that she is not one who could commit for the long term. The war intercedes, and the two friends are fighting on opposite sides. After the war, Catherine, married to Jules and raising their young daughter, is emotionally dissatisfied and embarks on an affair with Jim. With Jules\u0027 blessing, things are idyllic for a while, but Jim proves too much the alpha male to defer to Catherine\u0027s whims, and the resulting imbalance leads to increasingly dramatic consequences.\n\nIn just his third film, Truffaut\u0027s trademark style emerges with fast cuts between scenes and naturalistic camera movements (courtesy of Raoul Coutard\u0027s fluid cinematography). Moreover, George Delerue\u0027s animated music score and Michel Subor\u0027s voiceover add to the evocative photo-album memory atmosphere. At times, the storyline feels a bit disjointed, but the fulsome performances more than compensate. Werner fully captures the internal struggle within Jules in attempting to reconcile his love for Catherine with her impossible demands on him. Serre has the comparatively more objective role but convincingly shows his character surrendering to the tangled situation. After her impressive turn as an obsessed adulterer in Louie Malle\u0027s \"Elevator to the Gallows\", Moreau solidifies her vaunted reputation here, conveying Catherine\u0027s petulance and unyielding passion in a vividly mercurial fashion.\n\nThe DVD extras are abundant starting with two commentary tracks. The first one, a more factual account of the production, was recorded in 1992 with Truffaut collaborator Suzanne Schiffman, editor Claudine Bouche, co-screenwriter Jean Gruault, and scholar Annette Insdorf. The second, produced in 2000, is far better as it has Moreau sharing her personal recollections of the filming with Truffaut biographer Serge Toubiana. Disc One also includes a brief 1966 interview with Truffaut discussing Roch� and a 1985 featurette, \"The Key to Jules and Jim\", which contains interviews with the author\u0027s friends as they discuss the inspirations for the characters. Disc Two takes a broader look at Truffaut with five separate interviews with the director over the span of fifteen years, as well as insightful interviews with Coutard and co-screenwriter Jean Gruault\n",
    "\nI\u0027ll tell ya... if I read one more review written by someone born after 1980 dissing Bakshi, I think I\u0027m going to start kicking rump and taking names. Do people diss Disney? Hardly, until they became such a movie mill that they are computer generating what used to be created by hand with a loving touch.\n\nLook at \"Cool World\" as the AntiToonworld of \"Roger Rabbit\". The characters are psychedelic, psychotic, retro and bent. There is a great deal of (expected) sexuality and lewdness, pushing the edge of the PG-13 as far as it can go. Lots of puns and inside jokes it takes an adult to appreciate, something Warner Bros. cartoons were masters at. Granted, they don\u0027t always hit the mark here, and there\u0027s more chemistry when the Doodles are on than when the Noids take over.\n\nBut I dare anyone to watch that scene with Holli cooing \"Let\u0027s Make Love\" to a sweating Mel Torme wannabe while she\u0027s having trouble keeping her Noidness intact and not feel the simulataneous urge to salivate and giggle. The transformation of Noids to Doodles when the wand is removed is humorous... a lounge lizard literally becomes one, a cowboy becomes a horse, a female lead a blank eyed Orphan Annie. \n\nThe end cap, where Byrne\u0027s character becomes a dim witted but sincere superhero, is happily reminiscent of Captain Sternn from \"Heavy Metal\". \n\nYes, the acting is practically phoned in. Yes, the plot is odd. But get over it, folks, it\u0027s adult animation, and it\u0027s entertaining. I watch it again and again... and I always laugh\n",
    "\nTrapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept. They did it in Saw II, House on Haunted Hill, And Then There Were None, and I\u0027m sure quite a few others. But that plot seems to always work. It does for me. House of 9 is no exception. It doesn\u0027t follow a storyline that\u0027s predictable, even though the plot is not unknown. There are surprises, suspense, thrills and tense moments. Believe me, you won\u0027t predict the ending. I was very satisfied with the movement of this film. It\u0027s an interesting watch\n",
    "\nSamuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey turn two distinct yet strong performances.  Jackson is always great to watch for his intensity, and this role suits that to a tee.  Spacey continues to impress with a solid and believable performance.  This film and its settings/supporting cast are *slightly* dated by today\u0027s standards, but the two main actors and the good story more than make up for it.  Highly worthwile\n",
    "\nSpider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That\u0027s what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It\u0027s a good film, but it\u0027s not really the way I thought a sequel should be.\n\nEffects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting. \n\nBut the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It\u0027s never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we\u0027ve known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don\u0027t seem to have progressed since the first movie. We\u0027re still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.  \n\nWe get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it\u0027s nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it\u0027s not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year\u0027s Spider-Man 3 will fix that. \n",

The first is Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the final being Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.\n\nAfter being imprisoned for 15 years, Ho Dae-su (whose name means \"getting along with everybody\") is released and finds he only has 5 days to find his captor and seek his revenge. Once the captor is found, Dae-su will learn about a past he conveniently forgot and find he is in for an even bigger surprise during the final confrontation.\n\nThe film is mesmerizing, hypnotic, and well edited with flashbacks and jump cuts. Park makes an elevator ride feel like a roller coaster. There is a notable fight sequence referred to as the \"one-take corrider scene\" where Dae-su takes several men in mostly hand-to-hand and hammer-to-head combat.\n\nThis is a powerful film. It is a meditation on our addiction to TV, the bloody thirst for revenge, and the tomfoolery your mind resorts to when it is forced to relive your memories. The film will make you question the importance of forgetting, forgiving, and the satisfaction, or lack there of, in seeking revenge.\n\nThe movie has an incredible build leading up to the finale. The end scene is full of twists. You will be amazed and you watch the truth slowly unravel. You learn that one memory is not as it appears and that another more important memory holding the key to the puzzle was completely forgotten. You will learn that getting the revenge is not the most important thing, but instead be able to live with yourself is. You will find that neither man will be able to do so, which leads to an explosive ending. There is also a bizarre, if not disgusting, love story at the center of this.\n\nFavorite Quote: Too many good ones to mention. It is a tie between \"Be it a grain of sand or a rock - They both sink\" and \"Revenge is good for your health, but Pain will find you again.\"\n\nDVD Extras: Commentary, Multiple Deleted Scenes, Interview with director, Still Gallery, and Trailers from Tartan Asia Extreme.\n\nBottom Line: You will be entranced while following the plot and pleasantly shocked the surprise ending. I will be seeking out Park\u0027s other work as well and I suggest you do the same.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\n\nMolly Celaschi\n[..]MySpace.com/HorrorYearboo\n",
    "\nAn absolutely wonderful film by Clint Eastwood. Thelonious was an amazing man. He said things on the piano that we wordsmiths aren\u0027t able to communicate. His unusual character made for an interesting subplot. This film is footage of the man himself, usually playing his music. I\u0027m just sitting here being stunned.\n",

As the individual titles have already been reviewed seperately, the big draw to this collection is being able to collect all of these brilliant films for much less than their retail price. The collectible booklet that\u0027s included provides plot summaries and quotes from the director and/or cast member(s). Overall, I highly recommend this collection for even the casual filmgoer who is looking for that unique film experience\n",

    "\nThe tale starts out with a historical reference to Chaucer.  For a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected. And then you see the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day (1944) England.\n\nTime is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury:\n\nU.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down.\n\nBritish Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war.\n\nAlison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `Land Girl\u0027. She seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Kent and the Pilgrims\u0027 road to Canterbury.\n\nThe night they got off the train at Kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious \"Glue Man\".  Then befriended by the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Mr. Colpeper is interested in the history of the Pilgrims\u0027 Road from Kent to Canterbury.\n\nUntil you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you.  Is the focus on a local mystery? The interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBe sure to get the Criterion version with the second DVD. The main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian Ian Christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star.\n",
    "\nThis documentary is very concise, and very straight forward.  It does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir.  It features interviews with some very credible sources, all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic.  I really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together.  This documentary makes a great point and I\u0027d highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics\n",
    "\nOne of the best movies I have seen!!! The subject itself forces you to look at your own limitations on anything that is out of your \u0027normal\u0027 boundaries. After watching this movie, you have a better insight on how limited most of us are and how this causes a lot more harm than we think it does.\nIn terms of film quality, it is also one of the best I have seen. The actors are tremendous, the characters are so accurately portrayed that you actually feel the pain of each one of them. Of course, Ludovic\u0027s innocence is rendered beautifully, but the changes that the mother goes through are very emotionally charged (maybe because I am a mother myself???). She seems at first to be the most understanding of all when it comes to her son\u0027s differences, then goes through a confusion stage, and then tries really hard to understand him. But when her family\u0027s whole life setting (house, husband\u0027s job, social life) goes havoc, she closes down emotionally on her own son which is extremely painful to watch. After one final emotionally violent confrontation with Ludovic, she realizes that she\u0027s loosing him and finally sees him the way it should be: her beautiful child, nothing more, nothing less.\nIt is also filmed in a very colorful manner (especially during Ludovic\u0027s escapes into dreamland), which accentuate the notion of Ludovic\u0027s innocence. The neighborhood setting seems to be a bit of a caricature of American suburbia (green front lawns, barbecue parties) with an European flavor (adults dancing at neighborhood parties). In any case, the movie seems to make a clear statement that intolerance seems to be most prominent in middle-class white surburban populations, which many could find this to be a bit of a stereotype.\nIn any case, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants something more out of movie than what is presented in mainstream movies.\n\n",
    "\nMonty Python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever.

    "\nWe have both of these, although we purchased them seperately. Save yourself the time and money and just get them together. The Magical Halloween Adventure has characters picking out costumes to wear and then it goes into hayrides, pumpkin patches, carving pumpkins and making cider. There is a cute songs about monsters not being scary. The Elmo Says Boo! one has cute songs with different poeple and charcters and of course has Elmo all over it. We have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that. In my opinion, they are not scary. Also, we watch them year round...especially the Elmo one. She will pull it out and ask for it...who knew you could have Halloween in July??\n",
    "\nI spent ten years working various scenes at the Trinity Church Hellhouse.  Yes, it is a bit campy, and yes, it is often over the top, but I can say that the people are well intentioned, just a bit off target.  I attended Trinity Church from birth until I was 22 years old.  I do not attend their anymore because of the close-minded attitude that is prevalant in this documentary.  I stopped doing HellHouse when they added the decision room my last year.  I just felt it was an un-biblical  scare tactic.  I now feel that way about the entire operation.  The worst feeling I get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves.  I know because I was once one of them.  I have found that a growing number of former Trinity Youth Group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons I listed above.  This movie will open your eyes to the way teens are herded like cattle in fundamentalist Christian Churches. \n",
    "\nThis is a movie you\u0027ll want to watch over again--a number of times for a number of reasons.  For one, you\u0027ll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first go-round (perhaps the second and third go-round, too, and even beyond).  As the legend goes, with the exception of a few brief, well-timed breathers, director Howard Hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film\u0027s sleek 92 minutes, with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once.\n\nI agree with the Amazon review: you\u0027ll also want to give the movie at least one look devoted exclusively to Cary Grant\u0027s performance as master-manipulator news chief Walter Burns.  One can only marvel at his hair-trigger, incendiary reactions to each situational development.  The big scoop involves the politically-driven gallows sentence of a meek little \"anarchist\" (John Qualen) alleged to have killed a black cop, and while ferociously tracking the story, Burns chats up and tries to reclaim his ace reporter, Hildy Johnson.\n\nThe movie is based on Hecht and MacArthur\u0027s long-running Broadway hit The Front Page.  An early talk-era version had been produced already for the silver screen, but Hawks decided his inspired idea of switching Hildy\u0027s gender to that of a woman justified another remake.  He was right: of the various stage and film renditions, His Girl Friday is regarded as the most powerful and effective use of the source material.\n\nHanded this basic premise, scriptwriter Charles Lederer added one last layer of complexity: Hildy Johnson is not just any woman, but Walter Burns\u0027s ex-wife.  As the action begins, she is bidding the chaotic, cynical, wise-cracking reporter\u0027s life farewell, having decided to settle down and marry an insurance man named Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy, perfect as the earnest, slow-witted foil to Grant).\n\nOn hearing this, Burns hatches his plot.  If he can pull off the entire stunt, he will beat the competition to a story on local corruption.  By getting Hildy involved again, and helping her realize the Hawksian principle that \"you are what you do,\" he will also regain a writer of rare talent.  These two goals alone would be enough to keep his motivation interesting.  But of course the chance to win back his ex-wife brings a sexy tension to the frantic, lunatic action.\n\nThe one thing you have to do is reserve a viewing strictly for watching Rosalind Russell as Hildy.  In the part that literally no one wanted (Jean Arthur, Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne and Carole Lombard all turned it down), Russell succeeds in making His Girl Friday her movie.  Among her colleagues in the press room (played by a sterling ensemble of character actors), she\u0027s got the hard-nosed wit to sound right at home with the boys.  At the same time, she stands out--not just in her bold pinstriped outfits, but with her unflagging dedication to the raw, key-punching grind of the professional \"news man.\"  When necessary she dashes from telephone to telephone, one raging conversation to the next, yet in the movie\u0027s moment of high pathos, she manages to be absoltuely riveting while barely raising her voice above a whisper.  Finally, of course, her kinetic scenes with Grant are what earn this movie its reputation as one of the fastest, funniest zingers ever produced.\n\nMy sole warning: fork over the dough for Columbia\u0027s authorized release.  The cheap-o\u0027s--and there are several on the market--are pretty shabby in terms of image and sound quality.  With so much re-watching in your future, do what it takes to get the best version\n",

    "\nThere were loads of Swords \u0026 Sorcery films coming out in the 80\u0027s, most of them low budget garbage.  But this was actually one of the better films.  It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable.  Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant.  Pretty standard stuff.  But it\u0027s exectuted well.  The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard\u0027s Conan Story \"The Hour of the Dragon\" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer.  In the Conan story the sorcerer\u0027s name was Zaltotun.  In this movie, the name is Xusia.  Mere coincidence?  I think not.  But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll (of Night Court fame).  He\u0027s suitably imposing and evil, as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life.  Unfortunately Xusia doesn\u0027t get enough screen time.\n\nLynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here, too.  Horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by Errol Flynn in Robin Hood than by Conan.  He\u0027s a fun-loving reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne.  He is eventually captured and Cromwell has him nailed to a cross, although it\u0027s an \"X\" cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism.  Again, this is a scene lifted from a Conan story \"A Witch Shall be Born\" when Conan was nailed to a cross.  Only Conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while Talon, actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately.  Now, I\u0027m no doctor but I\u0027m guessing that someone who had a 4\" nail driven through their palms is NOT going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but, ok, it\u0027s fantasy so I\u0027ll buy it.\n\nStill, despite some shortcomings, this is an enjoyable little diversion.  The ending Credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized\n",
    "\nThe technical quality of the DVD is excellent.  My interest in the movie is the result of seeing a photo on a friend\u0027s wall of Charlie Chaplin and an actor.  The actor, Hugh Sasson, was the Uncle of my friend\u0027s mother.  He appears early in the movie as the person who has his pocket picked.  The photo is the shot in front of the hot dog stand when the victim sees the tramp paying for a hot dog out of his wallet.  We set the photo on the TV and stepped through this scene on the DVD one frame at a time.  It gave us all goose bumps as somehow the extreme slow motion made them seem alive in real time.\nAdditionally, the story of the production difficulties found on disk 2 are fascinating\n",

    "\n\"Mighty Quinn\" features a young sexy Denzel Washington (Xavier Quinn) as a smart detective who did a stint with the FBI and returns home as police chief on a Carribbean island. There\u0027s a shadowy plot involving $10,000 bills, a guerilla movement and guns, but the movie focuses more on Quinn\u0027s conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder, and Quinn\u0027s own discomfort from having \"made good\" but ending up caught between two worlds, white and black. He\u0027s also caught between the islanders\u0027 desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation. This film is full of sexy island women, colorful reggae music, and real world dilemmas of race and identity. No matter that we couldn\u0027t quite figure out if the plot hung together. A winner\n",

Caitlin Clarke\u0027s performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job.  I wrote her when the film came out telling her as much, and received a hand-written thank you letter.

The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn\u0027t really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie.  This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on.  Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck\n",

    "\n\"I Wake Up Screaming\" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low-key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of \"noir\" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called \"mystery lighting\"- in this film made in 1941, before the United States entered the War. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher, adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor, who moved the action to New York, gave it a flashback structure, and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre-War Hollywood that combines multiple genres: Mystery, romance, musical (the singing scene was cut), comedy, suspense, and psychological drama. But the suspense does dominate. \n\nWhen model and aspiring actress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is murdered, the police are quick to blame Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), a fight promoter who met Vicky when she was a waitress, introduced her to all the right people, and managed her ascent to glamour girl -until she left him for Hollywood. Vicky\u0027s down-to-earth sister Jill (Betty Grable) disapproved of her career choice but doesn\u0027t want to believe Frankie responsible for her death. The Assistant District Attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator (Elisha Cook, Jr.) at the Lynns\u0027 apartment building is the killer, but sadistic police detective Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) won\u0027t let up on Frankie, constantly harassing and threatening him, leaving Frankie little choice but to find the killer himself. \n\n\"I Wake Up Screaming\" opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape. That got my attention. Then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station. Frankie Christopher is harshly lit with one lamp, surrounded by police officers in the shadows. Gorgeous, dramatic, low-key lighting. The faces of some characters, even Frankie, are sometimes completely blacked out. I don\u0027t know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it\u0027s deliberate. But it\u0027s daring. Everywhere we go in the station house, there are bars and shadows. The implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming. The police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic. This really surprised me in such an early film, but it\u0027s fabulous.\n\nThis was Betty Grable\u0027s first non-musical role. She\u0027s all sweetness and goodness, but she is also level-headed, practical, and brave in the mold of a film noir helper-heroine. Unfortunately, every time she appears on screen we hear \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\", which eventually drove me a little nuts. Victor Mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist. But the stand-out performance comes from Laird Cregar as the very creepy, obsessed police detective Cornell. He\u0027s truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains. The dialogue isn\u0027t hard-boiled except for a few lines delivered by Vicky. But \"I Wake Up Screaming\" is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering Hollywood\u0027s visual vocabulary. \n\nThe DVD (20th Century Fox 2006):  A few scenes show some white specks and lines, but this print is generally good. Sound is good. Bonus features: A deleted scene called \"Daddy\" (4 min), in which Betty Grable sings. This doesn\u0027t fit the tone of the movie well, so it was best left out. \"Hot Spot\" (text) is a brief account of the film\u0027s title change from \"I Wake Up Screaming\" to \"Hot Spot\" and back again. We can watch the opening credits for the film with the \"Hot Spot\" title (1 min). There are 3 \"Still Galleries\": A Poster Gallery (3 posters), a Production Stills Gallery of behind-the-scenes photos (8), and a Unit Photography Gallery of publicity stills (38 photos). It\u0027s interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself. There is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Film noir historian Eddie Muller delivers a good, nearly constant audio commentary. He compares the screenplay to Steven Fisher\u0027s novel, provides background information for many of the creative crew and actors, discusses the noir visual style and the juxtaposition of light and dark thematic elements in the film. Muller speaks a lot about the people involved in the film, as always. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish\n",
    "\nFirst-time feature director/screenwriter Alice Wu\u0027s 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it, but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling, unforced humor and a trio of winning performances. With a conflicted protagonist at its core, the film shares the same souffl�-light rom-com territory as Ol Parker\u0027s half-hearted \"Imagine Me and You\" and Ian Iqbal Rashid\u0027s overly cute \"A Touch of Pink\". Wu, however, manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly, because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes.\n\nThe plot focuses on Wil, short for Wilhelmina, an obviously talented Manhattan-based surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional Chinese family living across the East River in Flushing. Referred to just as \"Ma\" in the story, her mother is a widowed beautician, who only speaks Mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her. Wil\u0027s eyes, nevertheless, are set squarely on a comely ballerina named Vivian, who happens to be the daughter of Wil\u0027s supervising surgeon at the hospital. Meantime, Ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home. Ma moves in with Wil, and the inevitable consequences ensue. There are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout, but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads.\n\nAs Wil, Michelle Krusiec is a terrific find, evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times. Lynn Chen is saucy and inviting as Vivian, though I wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue. Both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable, culminating in the inevitable girl-on-girl scene. Despite the beauty of her younger co-stars, Joan Chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character. Even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty, Chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties, making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning. Yet, she is able to convey the necessary brittle, distanced manner as Ma, making her character\u0027s self-discovery process more rewarding.\n\nThe ending is on the pat side, especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a wedged-in riff on \"The Graduate\", but it doesn\u0027t compromise the sweet-natured charm of the piece. Special mention should go to Harlan Bosmajian\u0027s cinematography, which captures the saturated colors found in the Chinese-American community. The 2005 DVD contains Wu\u0027s thoughtful commentary on a separate track, as well as several deleted scenes, a standard, ten-minute making-of featurette and a rather dull Sundance video diary\n",
    "\nScenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman. To me, this is one of the best films ever. It not only captures a great story, but it is done so well.\nWhat makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel, act, and generally take care of issues.\nThis isn\u0027t one of those American films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them.\nIn here, as he is telling his wife about this other lover, she is without emotions, just staring off, with no real reactions whatsoever, a way most would respond.\nThis is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is great/perfect. It is later that she finds outs that perhaps, the marriage isn\u0027t so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce.\nThere, the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage. He later says he\u0027s been with a woman for a while now, and shortly there after, leaves her.\nAfter a year of so, they get together to sign the divorce papers, which turns out rough at the end.\nAfter some time, they get together again, and in some way, fall in love once again, even though both are married to other people.\nThere, the movies ends.\nGreat film! Hard to watch some american films now, because most just seem horrible, and in ways, corny. I\u0027m glad I got to see a great film like this.\n",
    "\nA lot of people like me who watches superhero movies want to watch a whole bunch of action with soo much CGI you cant even tell what\u0027s real or not. Anyways, I expected this movie to have the too much action I can handle. Guess I was wrong. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I like this movie, but I just hope Spidey 3 will have tons of action!!!!!!!! And Tons of CGI EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!With 3 NEW VILLAINS!!!!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!! SANDMAN, HOBGOBLIN, and VENOM!!!!!!!!! Anwyays, just don\u0027t make the movie about Peter Parker, but Spider-Man, THANK YOU Stan Lee for creating Spider-man\n",
    "\nThreshold starring Carla Gugino (Special guest Catherine Bell episode #11 Outbreak): \ni loved this show. i liked it when it was on CBS and i like it even more now that i got the dvd\u0027s with the unaired shows to at least try to bring it to some sense of a conclusion. \nCarla Gugino was very good (as usual)playing a strong woman named Dr. Molley Anne Caffrey a contingency analayst who\u0027s job it is to come up with worst case scenarios for any natural or man-made disaters. (earthquake,hurricanes, WWIII, epidemics, worldwide finacial depression) you get the picture. the one she is called upon for is for a scenario named \"Threshold\" (hence the name of the show). Threshold - is the contengency plan for alien invasion. her job is now to put the plan in motion. to quickly assemble a team made up of a physian, a mathmatican/linguist, an areonautics engineer and navy seal whose job it is to implement the orders she gives out usually via military force or other covert means and to protect the \"Red Team\". and asscess the threat and plan how to stop the threat. \nthe actors who played the other members on Molly\u0027s team were all good and i believed and cared for them all. but this review is about Carla and Catherine so i will get to the point. \nCarla owned the show, she carried it off just like she did in \"Karen Sisco\" \nshe told a great story and added importance to a very well done show. i really do believe she is one of the best and underrated actresses in the business today. and she was just stunningly beautiful. every time she was on camera you could not help but to focus on her. the camera loved her. the beauty made you look her way. but the acting, the way she carried herself. made you stay focused on her. \nCatherine Bell was on the episode \"Outbreak\" this episode was about about how Molly and her team discovered that one of the ways the aliens could spread and infect people was through the food supply. now they already knew this a few episodes before but, they thought they took care of it, but they were wrong. Molley needed to know exactly how they spread it, to what foods and how long did it take effect on people who ate it. so she basically drafted Catherine Bell and made her apart of the team whether she wanted to or not. \nCatherine Bell played Dr. Daphene Larsons. an expert on Botony and Biology. who figured out that some foods were more likely to get it and that it was mainly tomatos and food like it that they need to worry about. i\u0027m afraid Catherine did not get much to work with here and she was only on it for that epsiode and only mentioned it the rest. i was told that had the show been picked up and went the next year she would have been a full blown cast member. \nBut Catherine - like Carla - was stunningly beautiful. however she does not have the same presence as Carla does when she on camera. she did a good job - but she had next to nothing to work with and there was no essence within her or her character\u0027s personality that took over when you got over her looks as opposed to Carla when she was on. Carla was on her game and stayed on it. it was her show. Catherine did the best she could with what little she had, she was not on her game. but it wasn\u0027t her show. \nCarla and Catherine had really no interaction together. the only one they kinda had was when Molly was briefing Daphene on Threshold and the story thus far. and that was done with Daphine sitting in a chair looking confused and over-whelmed while Molly stood in front of her and explained it all. and it was all done using cross fade and fade in-outs edits. i appreciated the effects - nice touch - but i would have liked to see some real dialogue there. i\u0027m pretty sure had there been an episode 14 they would have done something together like i don\u0027t know; kick some alien butt together or Kissed. \nin conclusion - i loved the show. then tension kept me going and seemed real. \nit wasn\u0027t neardy and though it was ScFi, i really did\u0027nt get that feeling. there was more to the story, it was intellegently done and i wanted more. but they cancelled it. the last epsiode did however give it some closeuer so you don\u0027t feel too cheated buying one season of the show. it left you having enough questions as to where you wanted to see more, but, could still come up with your own conclusions. they ended it like they could add more to the story at a later date in a form of a movie or another show but if they never do. then i guess it is still okay. \nthe show was supposed to last three years going in accordance to Molly\u0027s scernario: \n1. Threshold - we have spotted and accessed the threat. \n2. Foothold - they have established themselves on earth. we have notified the public and began to stop them by any means necessary. (Probably what season 2 would have been called. \n3. Stranglehold - if it get to this point it either means we have stopped them and sent them home or they have won and anhilated us. (Season three title i suppose.) \nshe never came up with a 4th stage. i guess it would be pointless. \n\n",
    "\nCBS\u0027s THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science-fiction thriller; however regardless of it\u0027s interesting story premise, good acting, and well supported production team, it, like NBC\u0027s \"SURFACE\" and ABC\u0027s \"INVASION\", was cancelled.  Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars.\n\nWas it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb?  Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube\u0027s \"reality\" shows and less than funny comedies.  \n\nWas it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting?  Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters.  Sadly, they didn\u0027t have the opportunity to finish the job.\n\nWas it cancelled because it didn\u0027t get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes?  Arguably, but the team did offer some great visuals, interesting plotlines, and nightmare scenarios.\n\nSo why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated?  Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer doesn\u0027t appreciate a good story takes time to develop (The X-Files, Alias, 24, Law \u0026 Order, CSI, Smallville, Numbers, etc.).\n\nIs it worth buying or renting? Yes.  Though a cancelled series, it has that one thing most of it\u0027s one season wonders don\u0027t have--an adequate conclusion that doesn\u0027t leave you wondering how a cliff-hanger is to be resolved\n",
    "\nDon\u0027t be fooled by stupid commercials that make this movie look inappropriate or like soap operas.  This movie is awsome and not at all about the guys chasing the girls, inappropriate behavior, or anything.  It\u0027s definitely worth seeing and watching again.  Great movie\n",
    "\nAn excellent total body toning workout by two motivating (and non-annoying) instructors. This is a perfect workout to add to any workout regime. Highly recommend this\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve been encouraged by Pat Metheny\u0027s music since 1980... that\u0027s a long time to follow one guy\u0027s music track, but through it all he has always grown and done more than you would expect. His trio record set the standard in the early days, with Bright Size Life (w. Jaco and Bob Moses), and his PMG work has been unusual and different and refreshing. One reviewer mentions \"cheesy tunes\" - in what sense? In the sense that they don\u0027t conform to a rigid set of jazz sounds that we\u0027ve come to expect (swing+sax+trumpet+upright bass + x y and z\u003djazz)? Great jazz musicians are innovators, and what PMG has done consistently through its life and continues to do is to create it\u0027s own genre of music unto itself - completely unique. Are you going to find 14 other groups sounding like this? No way. Not even one. I know cheesy music when I hear it, and there are plenty of so-called mainstream jazz artists that are guilty of it in addition to the usual suspects. Most jazz musicians will be remembered as that guy or gal that sounded kind of like Miles or kind of like Coltrane or Brecker or whatever. The great ones are the ones others are compared TO, and Pat Metheny falls in that category. \n\nIf you are open-minded to creative music and want to enjoy great musicians at the top of their game, creating art together as a team listening well and bringing fresh new ideas to life, then buy or rent this DVD. If you want to hear what one kid from Missouri who was by age 15 determined to play with Gary Burton (and he did) was able to do with the guitar by just doggedly pursuing it year after year, creating fresh new material, taking the beauty of the guitar to new levels each and every year, then listen to this DVD and be a part of his history. Because Pat is one of the true geniuses of our age. His relationship with Lyle Mays persists to this day - what a story of loyalty working together though a lifetime.\n\nAnd Pat is able to draw more talent out of his musicians than most bandleaders. A lot of jazz artists have used Richard Bona over the years as a talented fretless bass player, but Pat Metheny gave him a stage to share the whole range of his talent. He does a solo with himself and some percussion and a delay pedal that is amazing - he harmonizes with himself and creates a tapestry of sound... Cuong Vu did something similar on this DVD with his trumpet.\n\nThe drummer and bass player (Antonio Sanchez and Steve Rodby)are just on it - this is a great band. If you get a chance to hear their Austin City Limits performance, I think it is slightly better in the sense of how raw it is; this performance is more polished, and of course a lot more time was taken in the mastering of this. Both live performances are worth checking out.\n",
    "\nI FIRST WATCHED THIS INCREDIBLE GROUP OF MUSICIANS I BELIEVE ON AUSTIN CITY LIMITS AND WAS TOTALLY TAKEN IN BY THE MAGIC THESE GUYS PERFORM ALONG WITH VERY, VERY GOOD CAMERA WORK WHICH COMPLIMENTED THEIR EVERY MOVE. PAT\u0027S FASCIALS ARE CAPTURED INTENSLY AS WELL AS ALL OF THE MUSICIANS PERFECTIONISM..\n  THE PERFORMANCE IS FLAWLESS AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF FEELING AS IF \"YOU ARE HERE\".

    "\n I\u0027ve been doing Pilates for several months along w/ my daily Yoga practice and it\u0027s been an incredible and effective addition to my program!\n\n At this point I have collected about 17 Pilates programs (along w/ my 90 Yoga programs) and there are certain teachers that have shone above the rest. For me Moira Stott is one of those special teachers that has a way of communicating so clearly and putting together such sound practices that I always look forward to spending time with her programs.\n\n I had purchased the four DVD pack w/ \"Basics\", \"Fit and Firm\", \"Secret to Flat Abs\" and \"Sculpt and tone\", and just this morning did \"Fit and Firm\" for the first time. For someone brand new to Pilates I HIGHLY recommend the \"Basics\" DVD, it\u0027s the single best beginners DVD/VHS I\u0027ve worked with since starting Pilates.\n\n As always Moira starts with detailed explanations and warm ups and with the help of a student who demonstrates beautifully, leads you through a wonderful, well paced pilates practice.\n\n This practice basically follows the intermediate Pilates series with some additional advanced poses added in as well. It\u0027s about  45 minutes long but flows so beautifully that the time really flies by.\n\n Some people find Moria Stott to be dry or boring, but I find her to be a pleasure to practice with. Perhaps because I\u0027m from a Yoga background (daily for the past nine years) I\u0027m used to teachers who are less \"rah rah\" (I also don\u0027t like blaring music when I\u0027m practicing Yoga or Pilates)so Moira\u0027s approach fits me well. If you like teachers who have a more hyper \"in your face\" personality then this may not be a good fit for you. But if you want a teacher who knows her stuff and who will guide you in a way that is sound and effective then Moira Stott is someone you will truly appreciate on so many levels.\n\n\n Other teachers whose teaching style I really enjoy are Hilary Burnett (her Intermediate program is incredible) and Jennifer Kries. \n\n I also like Ana Caban and Michelle Dozois for variety in my practice.\n\n Highly recommended!\n\n",

    "\nDefinitely a great movie, Rules of Engagement, brings to the screen two stories as they unfold simultaneously; that of a military investigation into whether an officer in the Marines was in violation of the code of conduct during an incident in Yemen, and the inner struggle of the investigator/defence lawyer as he tries to come to terms with his past and the ghosts that have been haunting him ever since Vietnam.... \nThe film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.\nNeedless to say, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel Jackson, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!\nThe plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!\nIn short, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven\u0027t already done so)!!  Strongly recommended along with Black Hawk Down, A Few Good Men, and Courage Under Fire.\n",
    "\nUnlike Marshall Fine,who wrote the Amazon review, I don\u0027t find the subplot in this movie hard to swallow at all!  Sadly, politically I believe many of our fine military personnel have been sacrificed through the years for political agenda, and I am not just talking about recently.  I am sure there are flaws in the movie, but I wasn\u0027t watching the movie for flaws.  Truthfully, military movies are not my favorite genre.  Having said that, I found myself up very late one night and \"happened upon\" this fine movie. I was mesmerized.  Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson were brilliant, but it was the short segment with the former officer in the North Vietnamese Army that riveted my attention more than any other scene.  Just brilliant!   I can\u0027t say more or I will spoil it for anyone who has not seen it.  Needless to say, I give it 5 stars because it is a movie that made me think, one I will talk about in years to come.  That\u0027s a barometer for my star-meter! \n",
    "\nI\u0027d seen this film before, in a lesser unrestored edition, and wasn\u0027t that impressed. Sure there\u0027s some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it\u0027s reputed to be.\n\nThanks to Mike Nelson\u0027s biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood\u0027s last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.\n\n(Okay, maybe I\u0027m overrating Mike\u0027s abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1-3, I think we\u0027d be looking at pure marketing gold. C\u0027mon Lucas, you know you can\u0027t resist any excuse to re-release yet another DVD version of your little sci-fi sextology. Give the man a call.\n",
    "\nOK folks, this is by far one of the best DVDs I\u0027ve bought in quite awhile. You get so much for so little. First you get the original black and white movie. Reefer Madness is like the Three Stooges, black and white just adds to its charm. But to see it in color is quite a hoot. The smoke is purple and pink, the suits and dresses are LOUD, and the color scheme for Mae\u0027s apartment is just mind boggling. What more could you ask for? Well you get more anyway.\n\nWhen I discovered that Mike Nelson from MST3000 fame actually had narrating duty, I just had to buy Reefer Madness again. He\u0027s hilarious. Sure it would have been great for his two robot buddies to join in, but who knows, maybe someday. Mike was right on the ball and I laughed out loud quite a few times. I never noticed before how much time the dope dealer spent making meals and eating.\n\nWell if that wasn\u0027t enough, we also get a short 15 minute film starring Grandpa Ganja. He\u0027s a marijuana expert who\u0027s been smoking pot for over 30 years. He quotes weed from the Bible, convincingly explains how Moses was a major dopehead, and also the disciples. Not only do we get an indepth history on marijuana, he demonstrates how to roll a joint, smoke a bong, and other helpful hints on how to administer medical THC. The old man is hilarious on helpful hints as to buying and growing your marijuana. When they showed the real old dude throwing marijuana seeds over his fence and then harvesting pot in his neighbor\u0027s yard I lost it. Low brow pot humor true, but in any case I laughed my butt off.\n\nIf you already have a black and white copy of Reefer Madness, it\u0027s worth buying again to have this edition. It\u0027s well worth it\n",
    "\nThis is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it has it all; suspense, good acting, good story line, and without much violence.\nThe plot is interesting, it keeps you guessing, and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nGreat job Hollywood, to all involved with this film, especially\nJodi Foster\n",
    "\nCary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Coburn (and a \"killer\" soundtrack by Henry Mancini) deserve much better treatment than they get in this no-frills DVD with absolutely no special features.\n\nThis comic murder mystery shows off its stars to their finest --in spite of a less than admirable film transfer.  It\u0027s all thanks to the great performances, tongue in cheek direction and witty screenplay.  Hopefully a better quality and enhanced DVD version will replace this one in your film library.  Nonetheless, \"Charade\" remains a charming and timeless classic\n",
    "\nUp until now, \"Basic Instinct\" has always been that little movie in pop culture in which Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs and exposes her vagina for an instant. After watching this movie, that is exactly what I\u0027ll remember it for. This movie is pop culture staple, it\u0027s stupid and impossible to predict. As soon as you think you\u0027ve got it, you don\u0027t, only to discover you do; as we we see with the ending. The movie what critics refer to as \"a bad movie\".\nAnd it is. However, people will forget \"Gandhi\" the Best Picture winner of 1980 something before they forget this movie. If you label your DVD collection, this would definitley be in the \"Guilty Pleasure\" section where you would also find movies like \"Wild Things\" and \"Cruel Intentions\". It\u0027s a movie that has big stars, a big budget, and a stupid story. But this all works perfectly. Oscar Winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, Wall Street) plays Detective Nick Curran, an ex-alcoholic and smoker, who\u0027s investigating the murder of a former rock star. The person believed to have commited the murder is Catherine Tramell (Stone), a novelist who\u0027s novel has detailed the killing exactly. As Nick discovers more about the case, he finds simalar incidences involving Catherine and at the same time he begins an affair with her. Probably not the best thing to do when you\u0027re pretty damn sure she\u0027s killing people with ice picks. The movie is packed with cliches and occasional bad dialouge that is only annoying sometimes. Oddly enough, Douglas and Stone are perfect in their roles. Stone catches the feroscity, sexuality, and glamour of Catherine perfectly; and Douglas plays the vulnerable, yet tough cop perfectly, as well. I can\u0027t see another actor in any of these roles, which is one of the highest compliments I think an actor can recieve. While it looks like Douglas made the smart decision by not returning for the sequel, I look forward to seeing Stone playing Catherine Tramell again in the movie. So, film buffs who actually know what a Best Boy Grip is probably won\u0027t like this movie; but entertainment seekers will surely like it.\nAnd hell, if you don\u0027t even care if it\u0027s a good movie...The sex scenes are great.\n\nIN REALITY: B-\nHOWEVER, VERY ENTERTAINING: A-\n",

    "\n\nThis is the masterpiece of atheist Spanish film director Lu�s Bu�uel. An unrelentless, devastating, unmerciful criticism of religion. Yes, it can be viewed as a social satire, a political vehicle, etc. That\u0027s what makes it a great film, that you can view it from different perspectives.\n\nTo me the most valuable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see, as in a wide canvass, the soul and mind of this great atheist man. It is revealing that Bu�uel took to the task of \"proving\" religion wrong and absurd with so intense passion and -I would even say- desperation. Because no one is more desperate than he who searches and can\u0027t find. But, as Unamuno would say to explain the angst of the author, it comes from seeking to believe with the reason and not with the life.\n\nThe film depicts Spain\u0027s social condition pretty accurately in those mid-century years. Unamuno explains this aspect (though he wrote decades before Bu�uel\u0027s work) as follows: \"In France and Spain there are multitudes who have proceeded from rejecting Popery to absolute atheism, because \u0027the fact is, that false and absurd doctrines, when exposed, have a natural tendency to beget scepticism in those who received them without reflection. None are so likely to believe too little as those who have begun by believing too much.\u0027\"\n\nAnother important aspect of the film is the way he depicts the poor. Helplessly incorrigible, lacking as much in money as in human virtues, and extremely ugly and repealing. It is very curious how Bu�uel did not even allow any little space for sentimentality or candidness; I mean, there is no hero or anything even close to it. It\u0027s a terrible portrait of the human soul. I would say pessimistic, but I don\u0027t think Bu�uel would agree. He would probably prefer sincere or realistic. The symbolism is so evident that any private school kid could figure it out, so forcibly paired are the scenes with their objects of criticism. And trying to make it so evident (and not as difficult as other of his surrealistic films) evidences his intensity of feeling, his anger, his hatred of all that Bu�uel despises, religion. And not only Catholicism -it just happened to be Spain- but universal religion. Going back to the the poor in the film, Bu�uel being a communist sympathizer, it is ironic that he doesn\u0027t show even a little mercy with his poor. I think the rich young man is a more admirable figure than any of his other characters. The female protagonist, the nun who gives up her vows being used only as a tool, cannot be expected to represent all nuns or all religious persons -it would be preposterous-. A case that in real life might happen isolatedly should not be used to prove a general rule. It is dishonest. But there is a correlation between his view of the economically poor and the Christian view:\n\n\"For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.\" John 12:8\n\nIsn\u0027t there something of the same nature? So how can one conception of the poor lead Christians to love them nevertheless (knowing that they will always be around), and the furious atheist/socialist to despise them (maybe not to condemn them, because surely \"society or the rich\" would take the blame). Well, that question is for everybody to meditate on.\n\nI wish people like Bu�uel would give Christ a chance. Unamuno, another great Spaniard, says: \"Note the greater part of our atheists and you will see that they are atheists from a kind of rage, rage at not being able to believe that there is a God. They are the personal enemies of God.\" But -I say- how can you be an enemy of someone who does not exist? \n\nHowever, this is a great and splendid work of art. But now, ending with a quote from Rousseau: \"Where is the philosopher who would not willingly deceive mankind for his own glory? With believers he is an atheist; with atheists he would be a believer. The essential thing is to think differently from others.\"\n\nNevertheless, it moves!\n\n\n",

But Crawl (Pauly Shore, in perfect Pauly form) her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be. When the holidays roll around, Crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for Thanksgiving, but Becca insists he join her and her family in South Dakota. Crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that\u0027s not enough to make things silly, Becca\u0027s boyfriend tries to propose to her, but Becca doesn\u0027t want to get married yet and Crawl announces to the family that he\u0027s already proposed to Becca. Now absolute silliness takes over and it\u0027s just so much fun from here on out. If you need something fun and funny to watch, give Son-in-Law a try. One of my all-time favorites in my collection of silly comedies. You\u0027ll love it\n",
    "\nNaysayers have proclaimed this neglected gem as depressing and self-indulgent, but perhaps they are just scared of seeing a movie starlet get truly \"real\" and show us the ugly truths about celebrity.  Asia\u0027s film would make a good double bill with DOGVILLE to make audiences realize the commonality between star worship and cannibalism. Ms. Argento pulls no punches--she splatters herself all over each frame, even introducing the film in a video prelude. She should be recognized as a hero, instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a self-pitying exhibitionist. But I bet if a man made this film, these selfsame critics would line up to praise it. Obviously many self-proclaimed feminists (of both sexes) are still secretly terrified, turned-off and intimidated when a women dares to actually show her \"real\" self. They are all the more angry because their knee-jerk reactions remind them they are not as ready to hear the truly \"liberated\" female voice as they might like to think. I say Asia has created something truly new with Scarlet Diva. It\u0027s ahead of its time and will one day be recognized as the forerunner of a brave new kind of \"chick flick.\n",

    "\nOk... this series isn\u0027t exactly like the Final Fantasy games, but the elements are there. For instance, you have chocobo\u0027s, you have cactuar\u0027s, you have the summoning of Guardian Forces (which by the way look really cool), you have character\u0027s which have too much power for their own good, and a journey. This journey is that of Ai and Yu\u0027s search for their parents, where they are accompanied by Lisa Pacifist, a woman who possesses the cool power of Kigen Arts. During their journey, they see and do many wonderous things in wonderland (I wont say anymore, I dont want to spoil too much of the plot).\nI have this product rated as 4/5 stars, but actually i think there it should be 4.5/5 stars. I really enjoyed this series, but I dock it .5 points because the time length ADV gives the series to be is inadequate. They say it is total 625 minutes, where actually each episode is 22min 45 sec, thus 22.75 min * 25 \u003d 568.75 minutes long total length of series.\nAnywho, if you like final fantasy, i suggest watch this series\n",
    "\nI rented Terror Train (1980) with a friend of mine about ten years ago and I remember after we watched it we were both like \"Is that it?\"  Not recalling what our criticisms of the film were at the time, but I decided to give it another chance, and you know what?  I liked it...I really did...I\u0027ll grant you it\u0027s not an outstanding feature, but the effort is there, resulting in an overall solid film.  Directed by Roger Spottiswoode (The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper, Turner \u0026 Hooch, Tomorrow Never Dies), the movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis (The Fog, Trading Places, A Fish Called Wanda), who, a couple years earlier, had appeared in a little horror feature you may have heard of called Halloween (1978).  Also appearing is Ben Johnson (Hang \u0027Em High, Red Dawn), Hart Bochner (Breaking Away, Supergirl, Die Hard), Derek McKinnon (Breaking All the Rules), Sandee Currie (Terminal Choice), Timothy Webber (The Hotel New Hampshire), and David Copperfield, who was at one time engaged to supermodel Claudia Schiffer but called it off as their relationship interfered with his work, earning himself a place in the `What the f?\u0027 hall of fame.\n\nAs the movie opens, it\u0027s New Year\u0027s Eve, and the boys at the Sigma Phi Omega house are having a party.  After a prank directed at one of the spaz fraternity pledges goes horribly wrong, we fast forward three years and see another New Year\u0027s Eve bash in the offing, this time a costume affair taking place on an excursion train, hosted by Doc (Bochner) and Mo (Webber), two of the fraternity brothers responsible for the prank that occurred three years ago.  Also in attendance is Alana (Curtis), Mo\u0027s girlfriend, who was also involved in the prank, but not to the extent to being fully aware of what exactly Doc and Mo had planned, resulting in some bad blood between her and Doc, who was essentially the ringleader (and a real a-hole, to boot).  Anyway, turns out the nerdlinger who was the victim of the gag is now a dangerous, homicidal psychopath, has decided this a good opportunity to exact his revenge by sneaking on board the train and murdering all those who wrong him back in the day.  Actually, it was a pretty good move because not only is most everyone disguised in costumes, but they\u0027re also stoned and/or drunk, and easy pickings.  Also, the trip is an all night deal with no place to stop, so once the fun begins, it won\u0027t end until it ends...eventually those on board learn there\u0027s a killer among them (after the corpses start piling up), but he could be disguised as anyone, so who\u0027s to be trusted?  Oh yeah, a magician played by David Copperfield is also on board for the purpose of entertaining the rubes, performing his illusions (never call them tricks as that really ticks him off).\n\nLike I said, I liked this Canadian produced movie, at least the 2nd time around.  I\u0027m not sure what changed, other than the fact I\u0027m older, but I think I have a bit more appreciation for the effort put into developing the characters within the film.  I believe this helped, especially in terms of Jamie Lee Curtis\u0027 character, as we saw she had real empathy for the kid who got tricked not so long ago (apparently she tried to visit him after he ended up in the hospital), along with strong disliking for the person whom she saw responsible for the prank, that being Doc, a self centered, manipulative type, mostly for his cruelty, but also because of the way he used her in his scheme.  The result of all this was an effort to make us feel for Curtis\u0027 character in that maybe she didn\u0027t deserve the same fate as the rest, and it work, for me at least.  The movie does fall within the `slasher\u0027 realm, but gore hounds will most likely be disappointed as there\u0027s actually very little bloodletting violence.  Spottiswoode, in his directorial debut, instead seems to be focusing on the suspenseful build up, rather than on the visceral material normally present within the genre.  I thought there was some very decent scares throughout the film...I didn\u0027t jump out of my seat or anything, but the movie did keep my attention.  The goofy bits for me was how well the killer was able to keep his identity hidden, even after those on the train realized who was the one responsible for the killings.  The story does throw around a red herring or two, but at one point, before his identity on the train is revealed, you should be able to discern which passenger he is...there was a definite sense of claustrophobia, as most of the film takes place on train that has only three or four cars, but then this also made the difficulty for those trying to find the killer seem all that much more, well, dumb.  One element that didn\u0027t really help was the amount of time spent watching David Copperfield perform his magic.  His character, who seemed quite smarmy to me, did figure into the plot, but it just felt like his lengthy performances were included to help pad out a decent running time.  I don\u0027t mind magic, but I would have  preferred there not to have been as much as there was since this was supposed to be a horror film.  It was kind of funny, though, given how seriously he takes his craft, to see him stuck on an excursion train having to impress a bunch of drunken college kids.  I did like the bit after the main conductor, played Ben Johnson, discovered the first body and attributes the death as being caused by `some kid messed up on dope\u0027.  As far as Ms. Curtis, her presence here did help a lot, and probably resulted in quite a few seats being filled at the time of the movie\u0027s release given her prominence of `Scream Queen\u0027 in the late 1970s/early 1980s (she had all of three films out in 1980...this one, along with The Fog and Prom Night).  Overall I found this to be a fairly engaging film, one that rises slightly above that of your run-of-the-mill slasher feature.\n\nThe picture quality, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks decent enough, and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital mono and stereo comes across well.  There\u0027s really not much in the way of extras other than a theatrical trailer for the film and subtitles, available in both English and Spanish.\n\nCookieman108\n",
    "\nUp until last years Match Point, Crimes and Misdemeanors was considered \nWoody Allen\u0027s last great film. I\u0027ve only seen 3 Woody Allen films (not counting Match Point) that came out after C\u0026M and before MP, but I\u0027d have to agree. Crimes \u0026 Misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with Allen\u0027s greatest work. Films like The Purple Rose of Cairo and Annie Hall.\nIt\u0027s a perfect blend of drama and comedy. In fact, Match Point was kind of a retread of this film. The drama without the comedy. This movie stars Martin Landau (\u0027Ed Wood\u0027) as Judah Rosenthal, an eye-doctor (I don\u0027t remember the term for one) who\u0027s been having an affair with a woman named Dolores (Anjelica Huston, \u0027Buffalo 66\u0027). Problem is, he\u0027s tried to break it off but Dolores isn\u0027t having it. She\u0027s, instead, threatened to expose his infidelity to his wife. He\u0027s barely intercepted the letters. He looks to a patient, a rabbi (Sam Waterston, \u0027The Killing Fields\u0027), for help...But it\u0027s not working. When he turns to his mobster brother Jack (Jerry Orbach, \u0027Law \u0026 Order\u0027) for help. Jack suggests murder. Judah reluctantly gives in. Meanwhile, a filmmaker named Cliff Stern (Allen) is tapped by his brother-in-law Lester (Alan Alda,\u0027Mahattan Murder Mystery\u0027) to make a documentary special on him. Cliff hates Lester, but isn\u0027t getting work anywhere else. While working on it, Cliff meets Halley Reed (Mia Farrow, \u0027Rosemary\u0027s Baby\u0027) whom he falls for, despite being married. In typical Woody Allen style, the film is fueled mostly by conversations between the main characters. I liked his ploy of showing clips of old movies (as a character was watching them) that kind of went over what was occurring in his own movie. The movie is separated into comedy and drama, kind of like Allen\u0027s \"Melinda and Melinda.\" The drama part is the Judah plot. The comedy is the Cliff plot. Although both of them drift into the other category occasionally. They both finally come together at the end. The movie simultaneously reminded me of Match Point and Manhattan. The former for obvious reasons, the latter because the endings are similar in what happens to Allen\u0027s character. Anyway, the acting is great of course. As is the dialogue, as always. There\u0027s a lot of great one-liners (\"I haven\u0027t been inside a woman since I visited the statue of Liberty\") and some physical bits of humor as well. If you\u0027re a fan of Woody Allen, you\u0027ll definitely love it.\n\nGRADE: \n",
    "\nThis is such a fun movie to watch. It is so goofy and ridicualous and you never get tired of watching it. Encino Man and Pauly Shore is one of the reasons why the early 90s ruled. There are so many cool scenes in this like when Stoney takes Link to 7-11 and they cruise the aisles looking for some grindeage to munch on. And when they go to the Mountian and ride the Viper in reverse. And the drivers ed  scene when Link thinks it is Rad Mobile and he puts it up on two wheels and they end up at the bar with all the Mexicans. \"You see that girl muchacho. Dont look at her!\" The prom scene was cool to, it had Infectious Grooves in it. They are a real band but that song was made for the movie. The singer and bass player are in Suicidal Tendencies and the bass player plays for Metallica now. But anyways... Yeah , this movie is totally radical. Daves room is really cool to. I wish my room was that rad. The school looks cool too. I wish my high school was like that. I notice that whenever i watch something like this that was filmed in the early 90s everything seemed real bright and cheerful. Am i crazy or has anyone else noticed this? Pauly Shores punch lines and phrases never get old. They age like a fine wine... Bud-dy.\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve also reviewed the first two volumes but I honestly believe that Volume Three is the best.  I plan on getting them all and have the entire series for the first time in my life but, if I had to pick a single best volume, it would be this one.\n\nFROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE has the most solid Cold War story of all the films and everyone is firing on all pistons.  Connery IS Bond in this one, making the character his own, and Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya as the villians are among the best.\nON HER MAJESTY\u0027S SECRET SERVICE is George Lazenby\u0027s only film and it remains a controversial entry in the series.  Myself, I loved it.  Diana Rigg is awesome, the photography and editing are great, and the story feels like it has more meat on its bones than any other film.\n(These first two films probably come closest to the Ian Fleming novels).\n\nLIVE AND LET DIE is Moore\u0027s first appearance as Bond.  It has a hit Paul McCartney \u0026 Wings song and a 19-year-old Jane Seymour, along with a very charismatic villian in Yaphet Kotto.  The boat chase is still thrilling and Sheriff J.W. Pepper is still hilarious.\nGOLDENEYE is Brosnan\u0027s first appearance as Bond and remains his best film.  Wonderful use of Russian locales, particularly the \"graveyard\" of Communist statues, and the deadliest Bond girl since Pussy Galore.\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY was an attempt to get back to better stories after the overblown epics of the Seventies.\n\nSo, as far as I\u0027m concerned, there isn\u0027t a bad one in the lot.  Like I said, I plan on getting them all--but this one looks like the best.\nEnjoy\n",

    "\n\"Stagecoach\" is significant, along with \"Destry Rides Again\", for redefining the Western for \"adult\" audiences.  Director John Ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences.  For sure the film does contain a number of Western archetypes(the gambler, the prostitute with a heart of gold, etc.) but they transcend the stereotypes.  \"Stagecoach\" is also significant as the film that broke John Wayne to mainstream audiences.  Wayne\u0027s entrance as the Ringo Kid is the stuff of legends.  There is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated Claire Trevor as the social pariah, Dallas, and Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone, for which he won an Oscar.  The film\u0027s status as being historically significant is not debatable.  As first class entertainment it is timeless\n",

    "\nThis is a fun \u0026quot;art house\u0026quot; movie. Fun because the script is tight and the acting top notch and you know from the start you are in the hands of a good director. Just the kind of thing you want from a night at an art house: not a message movie like many such films but instead in-your-face film making - and three cheers for that. Campbell Scott plays the smooth player who tutors his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) on how to get laid. The action takes place mostly in one night of bar and party hopping. This script is so good that any bar lizard could learn from the lines and strategy used by Scott\u0027s character. Scott\u0027s character is an accomplished and dedicated player who never sees the wrong in his ways and that is the delicious and honest part of the film. One review talked about the player venting his anger at women but my take was that he stayed in control the entire movie, venting naturally (and within limits) when he was thrown over by his boss/lover. Like him or hate him, the player is a pro from beginning to end. The viewer has to decide whether he likes or dislikes women. In the final analysis what matters is how well Campbell Scott\u0027s character plays the game and he is a rodger dodger in an age of Politically Correct repression. How refreshing!

    "\nTHE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is the epitome of how sublime the Film Noir genre can be.  The story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome hired-hand into murdering her much older husband.  Based on the novel by James M. Cain and boasting the stylish performances of Lana Turner and John Garfield, this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic.  Over half a century later, we are still singing it\u0027s praises.\n\nFrom Lana Turner\u0027s memorable entrance as Cora Smith (clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres), the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills.  The drifter Frank Chambers (Garfield) is so completely infatuated that murder can be as easy as picking up a lipstick case.  Cecil Kellaway, Karl Malden and Hume Cronyn co-star.

    "\nYou can\u0027t wipe murder off our hands; well perhaps you can, especially if you\u0027re like the two main protagonists in The Postman Always Rings Twice, an absolutely marvelous movie of dark despair and foggy, murky paranoia. Based on the novel by James M. Cain, the movie is all about the terrible consequences that can result from unchecked desire and obsession.\n\nThe sexy John Garfield stars as Frank Chambers, a tough, enigmatic drifter from San Francisco who arrives in the small California town of Twin Oaks. Frank\u0027s a pretty rough and tumble sort of guy; he\u0027s a little lazy and a bit of a con artist, but he\u0027s decent enough and soon he gets offered a job in a diner run by Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway). \n\nNick is very eager to employ Frank, but Frank initially hesitates, that is, until he meets Nick\u0027s much younger wife, Cora Smith (a gorgeous Lana Turner). Cora is a blonde bombshell, a real knockout, first appearing in front of Frank in skimpy shorts, she\u0027s even photographed from the legs up. Cora is a teasingly sexy femme fatale, rolling her lipstick towards him in a hesitant dance of seduction, perhaps a promise of what is to come. \n\nThe sexual attraction is almost immediate, and as the tension steadily builds, they begin a clandestine affair, taking moonlit swims together, while the affable Nick remains totally unsuspecting of what\u0027s going on. Soon Cora confesses to Frank that she doesn\u0027t love her husband and she that married Nick to give her a sense of security. Desperately in love, the two decide to run away together by hitching, but Cora decides she doesn\u0027t want to start life again with nothing and returns to the diner. \n\nBy this time, Frank can\u0027t get Cora out of his head, and with both of them feeling ever more trapped, they decide to arrange an accident for her unsuspecting husband. But their plan doesn\u0027t quite work; the situation becomes even worse when the local DA (Leon Ames) catches onto them and their evil schemes. The plot takes many twists and turns as Cora and Frank try to outmaneuver the law, Nick, and also a pair of unscrupulous lawyers who are intent to see the sultry couple double-cross and sell out on each other. \n\nDespite the imposition of strict censorship laws, The Postman Always Rings Twice bubbles over with passion, even though much of the sensuality is suggested. And because the censors wouldn\u0027t allow any sex or violence, the filmmakers had to imply what was going on, so the film projects an undercurrent of barely disguised passions, sexuality, and murder. \n\nThe censorship restrictions also make the performances of Garfield and Turner that much stronger. Relying on sharp dialogue and facial expressions, the actors manage to weave a gorgeous sensual dance together, both lighting up the screen and creating two of the most smolderingly complex characters ever seen in film. \n\nThe Postman Always Rings Twice is a classical noir tale of love that just goes disastrously wrong. Lust, deceit, lies, and betrayal inevitably result because the two star-crossed lovers just can\u0027t let go of each other and are trapped by their desires. Cora is dreadfully insecure and wants something in life that has always eluded her. And Frank is too caught up in his feelings for Cora to see reason; he\u0027s just too weak-minded to see how warped his judgment has become. \n\nThe Postman Always Rings Twice was remade in 1981 with Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson in the lead roles. I\u0027ve never seen it, but hearsay suggests that, although it is much steamier (minus the restrictive censorship laws), this version is still far superior, even after all these years. With its edgy character development, it\u0027s stylish photography, and with Turner and Garfield as the leads, it is indeed a terrific film and remains a verifiable masterpiece of Hollywood film noir.

    "\nI was reluctant to watch \"Almost Famous\" because I figured it would be chock full of hype...but for some reason I decided to finally sit down and watch this story...and I\u0027m glad I did.  I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies. Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.\n\nI especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old-timer band-aides while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully...\n\n\"They don\u0027t even know what it is to be a fan. You know, to truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts...\"  \n\nAlthough I am not, and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination I am an avid rock/pop music aficionado, I thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of die-hard fandom perfectly... \n\nI liked the way Cameron Crowe humanized the groupies...sure some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional, but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars...and they do have feelings, just like anyone else...and I thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of \"Penny Lane.\"  I can remember when back in the 70s, groupies were \"little celebrities\" themselves...so sersonally, I don\u0027t think that people should label them as tramps or judge them too harshly...besides, who knows...maybe someone you know or may be related to may have a \"sweet little secret\" they\u0027ve been keeping along these years? It was the 70s after all...some of those rockers got around...and some apparently ordinary girls did too...fact: some of those gals just did what many of us wished we could do...and they were for the most part honest about it...\n\nAt any rate, the music used in the movie is just awesome! It sure was fun to hear \"Go All The Way\" by the Raspberries as well as \"Tiny Dancer\" by Elton John. How could you not sing along to that 70s classic?\n\nNow that I\u0027ve been reading the reviews about the \"bootleg\" director\u0027s cut, I\u0027m going to have to watch that one, too. \n",
    "\nBEST MEN surprised me very much; I wasn\u0027t expecting such a delightful, if a little bit depressing, movie.  Directed by Tamra Davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor, this movie is one of those you smile most of the time, and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot.\nLuke Wilson plays Jesse, a convict getting out of prison after a theft, and who is getting married to his sweetheart, Hope (Drew Barrymore).  Along for the ride are his best friends (Dean Cain as a former Green Beret, who is gay; Mitchell Whitfield as the lawyer Saul, who was Wilson\u0027s lawyer; Andy Dick as the nerdy Teddy, who is in a bad marriage; and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays Billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as Hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks.  Billy doesn\u0027t tell his buddies that he\u0027s planning on robbing a bank before the wedding, but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff (Fred Ward) who also happens to be Billy\u0027s father!  Soon, the inevitably nasty FBI comes in, headed by the sadistic and cold agent, played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable Raymond J. Barry (Dead Man Walking, The Chamber).\nThe movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale.  This dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest.  Brad Dourif gives one of his best performances since \"Cuckoo\u0027s Nest\" as the mentally challenged Vietnam vet.  Fred Ward, Dean Cain, Sean Patrick Flannery and Mitchell Whitfield are also excellent.  It\u0027s the best work I\u0027ve seen Cain do.\nThe movie entertained me immensely, and I would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy!  Or is it a comic drama?\nCheers\n",

However...the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices, it just happens to be how the devil got involved with Johnney (the missing crooner).\nMickey Rourke is stellar in this movie..Bonet is enchanting...Deniro is flawless. \nWorth owning!\n",
    "\nThis was much, much better than I expected it to be.  A real tear jerker.  If I was to let myself cry, this movie would\u0027ve been it, not \"The Joy Luck Club\".  Andy Garcia surely deserved an Oscar nomination.  He was simply great.  I was not a big fan of his, but here he clearly impressed me.  Of course, he was also terrific in \"The Godfather Part 3\".  Meg Ryan was effective, but still a little too cutsey, with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films.  But the two daughters were outstanding, especially the older one, played by Tina Majorino, who appears to be about 7 or 8.  Also, the look of the film, set in San Francisco, is good, especially the interiors of their house.  Garcia really seems to care about Ryan.  This movie is about love, and how it doesn\u0027t always carry the day with alcoholics.  I also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things, they\u0027ve been married and had a kid (you don\u0027t learn til much later that he is not the older kid\u0027s dad), and we see her drink a lot.  They don\u0027t start with how they fell in love, or even attempt to explain why she\u0027s an alcoholic.  Smart\n",

Taiwan is a modern, impressive city, a place rarely seen on American television or film. I might be looking at Manhattan rather than Taipei.  The computer engineer\u0027s family, the wife with spiritual emptiness, the teen daughter involved in her first serious sexual activity, the grandmother on life support, and the eight-year old son teased to exhaustion by little girls, they live in a high-rise condominium over a raised superhighway.

    "\n`Ben-Hur\u0027 released in \u002759 is an inspirational tale of betrayal and revenge, love and endurance, forgiveness and redemption played out amidst the backdrop of the last years of Jesus Christ\u0027s earthly ministry.\n\nPlot: Judah Ben-Hur (Charleton Heston), a wealthy Jew living in the Holy Land is falsely accused of crimes against Rome and sent off to spend the rest of his days as a slave on a Roman galley. His estate is confiscated, his Mother and sister thrown into prison. His accuser is a Roman officer named Messala (Stephen Boyd), Judah\u0027s best friend since childhood. \n\nJudah survives the hardships of slavery, gains his freedom and eventually becomes the adopted son of a powerful and wealthy Roman Reagent. Providence certainly appears to be guiding Judah\u0027s path. However Judah\u0027s heart is filled with hate for Messala. He cannot forgive or forget what he and Rome has done to him and his family. He returns home in an attempt to restore what he has unjustly lost and avenge himself against his old friend.\n\nWinner of 11 Academy Awards \u0027Ben-Hur\u0027 is truly an epic among epics. The massive backgrounds and sets will take your breath away, but the true beauty and strength of this film is found in the story it tells and the incredible cast that brings this story to life. The most memorable scenes in `Ben-Hur\u0027 are the intimate moments, the quiet conversations, the longing glances. My personal favorite moment is when Judah finds himself falling hopelessly in love with Esther (Haya Haraeet) one of his house slaves. While granting her freedom so she may be free to leave his service and marry, he places her slave ring on his own finger as a symbol of his undying love for her.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have a copy of Ben-Hur in your DVD library, you don\u0027t have a DVD library\n",
    "\nWhen I am watching a 1984 sci-fi movie, I am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns.  Some may call it predictible, but myself I feel that the story flowed and made sense.  Too many times have I seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere.  Tom Sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop.  Gene Simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his KISS type persona and plays the evil genius well. I for one enjoyed this movie alot, and unlike Blade Runner didn\u0027t find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line. If you are looking for a believeable near future story, pick this up\n",
    "\nHOUSE OF STRANGERS is a cautionary film about the dangers of hatred being passed onto the next generation almost as if hatred were an old and unwelcome pair of shoes. Edward G.Robinson is Gino Moretti, a self-made banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral. In his over the top performance as an Italian who might have been Vito Coreleone had the Don chosen to go straight, Robinson is a totally self-centered egomaniac who comes off more as a smug Biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the old-world banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations. It is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons, insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there. It is only Max (Richard Conte), who can see,if only belatedly, the vision of his father. And even Max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers. Max cannot do this alone; he requires the understanding first of Maria (Debra Paget) then later Helen (Susan Hayward), both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within. Gino Moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons,\"Who do you think I built this bank for?\" generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father. The difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may, in similar real-life situations, have emerged. What goes around truly comes around, and HOUSE OF STRANGERS continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche\n",
    "\nBefore anything else, I agree with those who say that Keaton\u0027s shorts are all good; but I strongly disagree with those who say that they are better than his better features. What usually happens with comedy is that people sit down before the screen and just say: OK, make me laugh. Keaton\u0027s features are funny -but they are also, and more important, beautifully shot, superbly acted and perfectly structured -which is something only the best actors/directors can put all together. There are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20\u0027s. Keaton\u0027s characters move in the real world, with real things, and that\u0027s part of what makes them lasting and unique. \n\nIn your shelves, Keaton shouldn\u0027t share his place with the Marx Brothers, but with Orson Welles (who called The General the best movie ever made about the Civil War) and Martin Scorsese (who said he watched over and over the final fight in Battling Butter -which, by the way, is not supposed to make you laugh, but to surprise you with it\u0027s realism)\n\nNow, this are the complete contents of this DVD set. Aside from it, you should check out The Buster Keaton Collection, which includes THE CAMERAMAN, SPITE MARRIAGE and FREE AND EASY - and then you are done. Well, you could also read the only book he wrote -My Wonderful World of Slapstick. (June \u002706 Update: \"Industrial Strength Keaton\"(DVD) just came out.

    "\nI love agressive ski videos that just kick [...], and STORM just rips. No stupid bikini skiing or inner tube follies (that I can remember) just great skiing superbly shot with an awesome soundtrack. My neighbors can hear me when I play this. They think I have a screw loose. \n",
    "\nAs a moderate skiier, and a filmmaker myself, this hits it home for me.  Warren Miller films are always shown locally, and there\u0027s hardly anything imaginable that could make me miss his new movie every year.\nNot being a Heavy Metal fan, historically the music tends to be distracting, alas this (past) year\u0027s edition \"Storm\" had just the right amount of pizazz and flare to make it my favorite yet.  There are moments nearly every year that I take home with me, but Storm was filled with the most amazing skiing, some of the most unique locations, and might add the most exhilarating editing I\u0027ve seen in quite a while!  Kudos to you folks!\nIf you can appreciate the splendor of mountain island skiing that harldy anyone on earth has even seen, let alone skiied, then this DVD will certainly expediate your plans for skiing this coming season.  You might not go to South Georgia Island, but there\u0027s plenty of skiing nearby...just roadtrip and split a cabin :\n",
    "\nThis recommendation is for the uncut version of Leon - The Professional.  A well crafted, tightly edited, excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll.  An action film that can be appreciated by those who generally don\u0027t care for the genre, the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it.  If you\u0027re looking for something worthwhile to watch, check this one out\n",
    "\nLuc Besson\u0027s \"The Professional\"  raises the stakes of Besson\u0027s playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman.\n\nIn \"The making of The Professional\" Besson says \"If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think \"It\u0027s in me, I\u0027m a beast!\" On this part we can\u0027t forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments\". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda\u0027s nose or Stansfield\u0027s unforgettable \"EVERYONE!\" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are good and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fat man\u0027s heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda\u0027s father.\n\nLeon however does not work only on this primary level; it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don\u0027t be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don\u0027t see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: \"everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid\" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in \"real life\"? I don\u0027t know but this movie can make you wonder.\n\nThen of course there\u0027s the sensuality. It\u0027s hypocritical to deny it; the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerizing fashion. It\u0027s not sick and it\u0027s not degrading: its art, subtle and beautiful.\n\nLeon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It\u0027s a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don\u0027t be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.\n",

Just thinking about it makes me tingle with anticipation!!! Rent this movie or you will not see it. Buy it or forever hold your peace\n",
    "\nRoyal Wedding has been a favorite in the Fred Astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago.  Astaire and Jane Powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film, and Astaire\u0027s dance on the ceiling (\"You\u0027re All the World to Me\") is classic.  The score, by Burton Lane (of Finian\u0027s Rainbow fame) and Alan Jay Lerner (future lyricist of My Fair Lady) is unbeatable.  I need not comment further on the film\u0027s merits--it speaks for itself.\n\nThe film is now in the public domain and, unfortunately, nearly all VHS and DVD releases of such films are deplorable at best.  That is not so in this case.  The DVD I\u0027m commenting on here is from Goodtimes DVD (edition 05-81171), and I must say that the transfer looks pretty darn good for a PD film.  The picture is clear, for the most part, and although there are some minor color shifts and age-related artifacts present, they do not distract.  Colors are fairly bold and are well defined.  The soundtrack is pretty clear and sounds fine.  There are no extras.  I have a very old 1980s copy of the VHS tape from MGM/UA Home Video and also a VHS dub I did off Turner Classic Movies two years ago, and honestly, this DVD looks better than both.  It is about as good as we can expect for a PD film that has not been restored from original elements.  Goodtimes is often better than most in their releases of PD films--it could be a lot worse.  Warner Home Video, which controls video/DVD release rights to the rest of the old MGM library, has not given us a studio DVD release of ROYAL WEDDING as yet, and as far as I know none is in the works.\n\nIf you want ROYAL WEDDING on DVD, I absolutely recommend this Goodtimes DVD release--it is probably the best one you\u0027ll find, is at a very good price, and comes in very nice packaging.\n\nRECOMMENDED\n",
    "\nWe all make mistakes in relationships, things we wish we could relive, do over.  This movie investigates the dynamics of one love relationship.  We go through two sceneros.  The first gives one the chance to live over a stituation, correcting all the mistakes he thinks he has made.\n\nThis movie will keep you guessing.  You\u0027ll experience the true deep feelings of love one couple have for one another.  These feelings end in the ultimate sacrifice for love.  The soundtrack is excellent.  I only wish we could buy it.  Hewitt really is an underrated music artist.  Her vocals shine and give depth to the movie.\n\nThis is a five star movie, more than a TV movie, Watch it some rainy Sunday afternoon, it will make you believe in love again.\n\n",

    "\nThere\u0027s only one word to describe this movie: suhweeeeeeeet! Despite the dozens of imitators, Bloodsport was the first and best of its kind. From the classic training sequence where young Frank Dux masters the martial arts (and receives the katana he coveted as a boy), to the motley group of tournament fighters with their goofy fighting techniques, to the repeated chanting of \"Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te! Ku-mi-te!\" on the pounding soundtrack, there\u0027s hardly a moment that won\u0027t have you pumped and calling for more. The only parts that don\u0027t quite work are the chase scenes and a young Forest Whittaker, who seems not to have completely understood what sort of production he was appearing in. But they don\u0027t detract from the main attraction: bone-crushing, blood-spattering beatdowns, and plenty of \u0027em. This is a quintessential guys\u0027 movie, and if you haven\u0027t seen it, you owe it to yourself to check it out\n",
    "\nthis 1988 gore film (i can\u0027t call it anything else since it\u0027s not a horror film in the classic sense) features an ensemble of Treat Williams {most notably from the \u0026quot;Substitute\u0026quot; series of movies} and comedian Joe Piscopo, known for his years on Saturday Night Live and stand-up comedy impersonating the likes of Frank Sinatra and David Letterman among others. The two play cops, Williams is Roger and Joe is his partner, Doug. the back of the VHS gives a detailed description of the film, plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie. Lindsay Frost plays the stereotypical \u0026quot;innocent\u0026quot; woman caught up in everything that\u0027s going on around her...but the corpse of the situation deals with Roger getting shot and coming back to life. he must solve a case within so many hours or he\u0027ll turn into ashes...and as the hours progress, naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally. Darren McGavin plays the part of an evil doctor. Vincent Price plays in a scene or two, and he\u0027s revealed to be the mastermind behind the Resurrection Room at the Dante Lab {he plays a guy named Loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead}. the movie is gory and off-beat, and it succeeds in being a good parody of the Lethal Weapon \u0027buddy cop\u0027 films even though it probably wasn\u0027t intended to be the first time around but that\u0027s the way i view it and on that point the movie is great. i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films...but those who like that kind of film will LOVE this one. it\u0027s not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can\u0027t be seen several times...like many of the Texas Chainsaw films are...but \u0026quot;Dead Heat\u0026quot; IS gory compared to other action films of this era starring Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. i give it 4 stars for the story, cast, and acting...minus 1 star for the gore factor\n",

I especially enjoyed seeing Debbie, Donny\u0027s wife sing a duet with Donny. And the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well. There was even a guest appearance by the Osmond grandparents. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned Christmas special. There is a mixture of traditional Christmas songs, some uptempo numbers, and even some spiritual songs included. A particularly poignant segment included little brother Jimmy singing a song out in the snow. I\u0027d never seen the two lesser-known older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show. One of the best Christmas specials I\u0027ve seen in a long time.

If your child is like mine and likes the characters she sees a lot of on Sesame Street (Elmo, Ernie, Cookie, Grover, etc.), they might not be as interested in this one (although Elmo is the cohost of the awards show with Herry).  It is nice to see the monsters that don\u0027t get a lot of play, though.  Herry Monster is in about half of the songs.

He seems somewhat taken with Alan Price who was there to \u0027brown-tongue\u0027 .. or maybe Alan had nothing else better to do, because he had just been fired from The Animals. Price DID get drunk and throw a glass out onto the street much to the annoyance of Zimmerman... he also opened a bottle of beer on a piano keyboard taking a chip out of the instrument showing total lack of respect for other people\u0027s property.

And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and, if anything, his real talents were underused in his career. Still \"The Searchers\" is a classic and deserves to be better known.\n\nThe 50th anniversary edition is a must for any collector. The restored print for the DVD is excellent. Just what you want to watch John Ford\u0027s gorgeous Monument Valley location shots.\n\nThe \"extras\" disk is also excellent. There are three good documentaries all of which were made with thought and genuine concern. A change from all those \"afterthought\" DVD extras. One documentary features interviews with Martin Scorsese and another some great shots of the film production camp in Monument Valley in the early 1950s, before it was on the tourist trail.\n\nThe documentaries would be of interest to serious film students and even amateur sociologists, they illustrate the many serious social issues \"The Searchers\" deals with, and takes a serious and humane point of view on, without preaching. A lesson I suppose for today\u0027s \"socially concerned\" film makers, they really need to focus on the film making and the story first. John Ford did and the message is powerful and still relevant today\n",

He was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days, an extremely likable \"old man.\" Hey, few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old, since he spent his younger days as a stuntman, rather than as an actor.\n\nSo, he was a very good choice to portray a likable thief: Bill Miner, the last of the stagecoach and train robbers. \"The Gentleman Bandit,\" I believe, was his label. This is a nice low-key adventure, with almost no bad language and the British Columbia and Washington state scenery is absolutely gorgeous. It would look great on widescreen DVD. What\u0027s the holdup? (pun intended)\n\nThe only bad news of this tale is the usual filmmakers\u0027 twisted message to root for a man who simply was a crook, nothing else. The film also - especially to get the younger audience - needs more action. It will be too slow for them, but I liked it, if for no other reason that I can listen to Farnsworth\u0027s voice all night.

    "\n\nFew days ago, I watched the documentary \"Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession\" (2004) about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100, 000 lucky subscribers in LA in 70s - 80s. While enjoying the clips from many Foreign and Independent movies that were the best part of documentary, I was able to recognize the movie that I saw many years ago in Moscow and still remember well, I could not only recall the title. I remember that the movie was Dutch, very erotic - in the raw, brutal, twisted yet beautiful and passionate way. Watching \"Z Channel...\" I was happy to instantly recognize \"Turks fruit\" (1973) aka \"Turkish Delight\" made by Paul Verhoeven in 1973. I checked with Netflix, the movie was available; I bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it. My memory served me well - Verhoeven\u0027s early film is as naturalistic, earthy, brutal, erotic, humorous, poetic, poignant, and captivating as I remember it. Based on the novel by Jan Wolker, \"Turkish Delight\" stars young, hot, very sexy (and I mean it - VERY SEXY) Rutger Hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor Eric and even younger Monique van de Van as his wife Olga, child-like yet as sensual as Eric was, \"the light of his life, the fire of his loins\". The film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful Holland\u0027s film that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film and was proclaimed by Jan Wolker a \"75% masterpiece\".\n\nThere are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as Verhoeven (of his Dutch period, especially). Verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work, fiery temperament, and aggressive movie-making. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven on two films said about him: \"The guy is like his movies: brilliant, mercurial, very daring, perverse, a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions...\" \"The Turkish Delight\" is all that and I love it but I can understand how its graphic sexuality, more than one disgusting and revolting scenes (but they had to be in the movie) and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers. Be prepared, \"Turkish Delight\" is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch.\n\n",
    "\nIf there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people, this would be it!  Mrs. O\u0027Hara, beautifully played by Mia Farrow, doesn\u0027t trust Edwina, the new beauty that\u0027s come to town.  The two battle it out, with Edwina coming out the loser in the end.  Or does she?  If I said any more, I\u0027d be spoiling the story.  Just watch this movie, and enjoy.  Things are never what they seem, and I promise the ending will be worth staying for\n",
    "\nHe highlights the concepts very well, for example the chapter on ball striking, i never knew this concept in 2 years of playing golf.\n\nMust watch, this DVD is made of several small chapters that have meaningful titles, therefore on the second viewing u can jump to the chapter that requires repeat viewing\n",

    "\nLadyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks. It seems to have all the usual bits: knight on a mysterious quest, lovable thief, and a loving couple under a vicious curse. Even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film, due largely to the outstanding cast: \n- Rutger Hauer (the knight, of course), \n- Michelle Pfeiffer (the other half of the cursed couple),\n- Matthew Broderick (knave with a heart of gold), and \n- Leo Kern (aging hermit, in on the terrible secret). \n\nSaying much more would mean saying too much, but it has the fairy tale ending you\u0027d hope for and expect - good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs.\n\nOne thing about this movie (or maybe the DVD transfer) truly annoys me, however. Someone messed with the colors, like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters, and hasn\u0027t learned how garish they can be. To whoever did it: please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time.\n\nOutside of that, it\u0027s a safe, entertaining movie. Enjoy!\n\n--wiredweir\n",
    "\nI first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend\u0027s house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since.  This movie has it all: comedy, drama, and one amazing love story.

A wonderful, wonderful film\n",
    "\n\tSince I was a child I have patiently anticipated the battle of evil versus evil. It was discussed in school yards and in the lunch room, at slumber parties and later when I started working as a clerk in a grocery store. It was a never ending argument- Who would win in the battle of Freddy and Jason? In my youth children spoke of some underground video tape that contained a battle between the two monsters, but I don\u0027t think that it ever existed and if it did I have never laid my eyes on such a relic, but finally the horror movie to end all was released onto the big screen and later on to DVD. It was everything I hoped for. There was blood, brief nudity and really bad jokes. That is the unholy trinity of horror. The plot wasn\u0027t horrible, it was actually pretty good for a fright flick. \n\tFreddy hasn\u0027t graced the silver screen since 1994 when Wes Craven presented \"New Nightmare\" and he kept his integrity intact in my opinion. Jason Vorhees on the other hand made the space film \"Jason X\" as his last trip to the theatres, and if you haven\u0027t seen it yet don\u0027t bother you didn\u0027t miss much. \n\tI liked how the movie gave a back story to Jason\u0027s life at Crystal Lake and it showed that Krueger is conniving and manipulative with getting Jason to go along with his plan to kill on Elm Street once again. Obviously Jason is a big dumb animal and does not need much convincing. The cinematography and directing were excellent, I thought the music was done well, and most importantly the film stayed true to the original story line. The only thing that upset me was after all these years waiting for this battle to come I was wrong about who would be victorious. \n",
    "\nJason X (as in Friday the 13th Part 10) sheds light on a familiar, though not too friendly, face: that of Jason.

    "\nThis is a fantastic history of the Blues!  Unlike any of the other recent documentaries, the stories are related in this show entirely by the artists.  There is no narrator and the feel of the show is very personal!  Add to that some great music and you have a winner\n",
    "\nJohn Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono were guests on the Dick Cavett show three times in 1971.  Their first apearance was taped on Saturday, September 11, 1971 and was John\u0027s first interview after the Beatles had disbanded.  The subsequent interviews were taped on Friday, September 24, 1971 and Thursday, May 11, 1972.  \n\nViewers, Beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among Dick Cavett and his guests.  John appeared to be in his element, happily chatting with the famous talk show host.  It was a good thing John rightfully defends Yoko during this interview and makes it quite plain that she did not break up the Beatles.  She has been wrongfully blamed for something that was bound to happen naturally - after all, the individuals who made up the Beatles needed to move individually; grow; develop their own individual styles.  The group could not last forever. \n\nCavett gives John and Yoko equal time.  He listens to them attentively; takes them seriously and at no time criticizes anybody or speculates about anybody.  It is very easy to forget the interviews are taking place before a studio audience as viewers are easily lulled into the flow of the conversation.\n\nYoko is very animated during this first interview.  She smokes; chats easily with her host about her undergraduate days at Sarah Lawrence and shows a film she made.   John and Cavett are actually funny, sharing some humorous observations about clothing and coiffure. \n\nBe sure to get this dvd collection.  It is funny; interesting; serious; thought provoking and memorable.  This is something for everybody and not just Beatle fans, Yokophiles and Lennonophiles.  The bonus dvd will certainly bring many smiles to many faces.\n",
    "\nBoy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I\u0027m interested to see what his earlier work is like.

Try and watch any regular martial arts movie afterward and all you can do is yawn, even the great Bruce Lee is tired and played-out in comparison to Kung Fu Hustle.  The movie continues to top itself throughout, with an escalation of fight scenes that peaks with the hero jumping higher than the clouds, seeing Buddha, lightly stepping off a bird, and plunging to earth to deliver a blow capable of knocking a fifty-foot hole in a building!  This aint just wire-fu, it\u0027s wired-fu with hilarious weirdness.    \n",
    "\nI know what you\u0027re thinking. If you\u0027re anything at all like me, when this movie was in the movie theaters and the previews were running rampantly, I thought this looked like the stupidest piece of trash to ever grace the big screen. But I\u0027ll admit readily when I\u0027m wrong, and here I absolutely was. I\u0027m not saying Little Nicky is the world\u0027s greatest film, or even comedy, but if you like Adam Sandler and silly comedies in general, this is a movie that won\u0027t disappoint when you desperately need something mindless to turn your brain into mush after a horrendous week (or even day) at work.\n\nA movie that opens with Jon Lovitz acting like a big, horny bird in a tree certainly promises to be very entertaining. And it is. And we\u0027re taken straight to hell with Harvey Keitel playing the devil himself very nicely, a brief encounter with Dan Marino, and the late Rodney Dangerfield to name a few. We\u0027re also treated to the heavens above with Reese Witherspoon and the guy who played Adam Sandler\u0027s golf mentor in Happy Gilmore. This movie has everything it takes to be insanely silly and entertaining. And you\u0027ll LOVE what happens to Hitler in this. \n\nDon\u0027t take it too seriously. If you do, you miss the entire point of Little Nicky. If this is your kind of movie, add it to your collection...you\u0027ll watch it many, many, many times again. Enjoy\n",

    "\n\"Annie Hall\" is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time. The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute\u0027s Top 100 (#31), as well as The American Film Institute\u0027s Top 100 Comedies (#4). The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic-comedies ever made. It really nails that awkwardness of romance. I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don\u0027t so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but can\u0027t really get a grip on love. He\u0027s been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic, which turns people off. Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton). Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it\u0027s share of ups and downs. Now, not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true-to-life but this film is also absolutely hilarious. When I see a movie on AFI\u0027s Top 100 Comedies, I tend to shy away from the films on that list. Not because they\u0027re not good, it\u0027s just that they don\u0027t really pick by what\u0027s the funniest film ever. Example, \u0027The 40 Year Old Virgin\u0027 was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot. But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny. The dialogue is quick-witted, some the scenes have become classics (Allen sneezing on the cocaine). In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it\u0027s nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is. This is a great film, a great romantic-comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece.\n\nGRADE: A\n",

    "\nI wouldn\u0027t write yet another review of War and Peace if I didn\u0027t have something new to say about it, namely, War and Peace and War by Peter Turchin. Near the end of Turchin\u0027s book, about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires, he quotes extensively from the parts of Tolstoy\u0027s War and Peace. Tolstoy, with his ratio analysis of various Napoleon Grand Arme metrics to Russian army metrics, was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time. Pick up Turchin\u0027s deep book, and afterwards read War and Peace, paying particular attention to Turchin\u0027s and Tolstoy\u0027s ideas.

    "\nI\u0027ve been a Christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of Rutherford\u0027s handling of the character.   I loved Joan Hickson\u0027s portrayal of Miss Marple and never thought anyone else could \"be\" Miss Marple for me.  Therefore I expected to be disappointed with these new releases.  I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED, I LOVE THIS NEW VERSION!  After I cautiously viewed the first episode I came to fully appreciate Geraldine McEwan in the role.  She is subtle, confident and highly adroit and I find her refreshing and wonderful.   The stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing.   Some reviewers complained that the scripts don\u0027t stick to the originals, but this is not an issue for me here.   Christie\u0027s stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they aren\u0027t always done the same way.   Any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times.  I think it\u0027s fun to be surprised by my old favorites!  Hooray for Geraldine McEwan!  I hope to see many more Miss Marple stories with her in the title role\n",
    "\nReleased during the \u0026quot;Just Say No\u0026quot; 1980s, this film is a cautionary tale of drug abuse.  Lenny is a guy just trying to stake his claim in the world, to make a little money. He soon impresses a big wheel  who moves Lenny and his wife to California where they are at first  overwhelmed by the opulence but then become willing participants in it.

    "\nI\u0027m the biggest \"Wuthering Heights\" fan I know (ask anyone who knows me, and they\u0027ll tell you I borderline annoying with the subject). Having money left over from my birthday, I decided \"Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?\". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I\u0027ve seen thus far haven\u0027t really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it\u0027s a good enough movie (as long as it didn\u0027t have Emily Bronte\u0027s Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn\u0027t showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than \u002792. \n\nNeedless to say, when I popped in the DVD, I was hooked by the first five minutes. Sure, the movie isn\u0027t EXACTLY like the story (I want you to show me a movie that is. And, as I said, this story is complex for the movies). Some of the things that are different/changed/added/etc., are the fact that, once again (as in many of the movie adaptations) Nelly is old from the start. Also, Heathcliff and Cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place (such as when they visit the Lintons). Most \"Wuthering Heights\" fanatics know that Heathcliff and Cathy never consemate their relationship. However, there\u0027s many a kiss in the movie. \n\nThere are some other details of the movie that are different than the story, but I, a crazy \"Wuthering Heights\" and Bronte admirer, give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan\n",
    "\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie: it\u0027s rife for debate. Gary Cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity, but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end, we know he\u0027d never do it again. Sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because \"I have to,\" and all that; but only a fool would think that a place like Hadleyville deserves protection. Can you imagine Clint Eastwood in Cooper\u0027s shoes? At least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown.\n\nOf course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with Hadleyville and its cowardly citizens, but has everything to do with Cooper and his code of honor. Isn\u0027t this the same Gary Cooper who played Frederic Henry in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, based on Hemingway\u0027s novel, a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and \"courage under fire,\" a character who says in the novel that \"abstract words such as glory, honor [and] courage were obscene\"? How could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day, never mind looking his wife in the eye again, if he\u0027d skadaddled? This existential hero had a choice to make, a life-defining one, and for him it meant only one thing. \n\nIt\u0027s that kind of movie - meaty and meaningful. The real-time experiment is interesting in these days of TV shows like \"24,\" and the McCarthy-era witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering, too. And let\u0027s not forget the music, either. But basically it comes down to Cooper reaching out and finding nobody there, and then doing what he has to do anyway. It\u0027s a timeless idea, and the movie is a classic\n",

    "\nThe age of the Hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the 20th century, then with the change of modern society in the 1960\u0027s, the western genre lost its allure and Hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare.  Thanks to Ted Turner and his love for American Western film making, the long lost western has been reborn in a big way.  Tom Selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of John Wayne.  Selleck is more than adequate for the part, big in body and big in acting skill.  He takes the part of Paul Cable, and turns his character into someone we can believe, like, and respect.  \n\nCable comes back from the Civil War months before its official end. He is tired of war and killing, and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of Arizona.  In trying to escape his wartime experiences, Cable runs into more trouble at home.  He finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence, and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning Confederate soldier.  Cable must not only fight to regain his farm, but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage.  \n\nThe story by Elmore Leonard is a solid one and very believable.  There are no dull or boring scenes, the picture grabs you and holds you throughout.  Selleck is terrific as Paul Cable, fighting for his family, his woman, and his life.  Selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of John Wayne.  He is every man\u0027s western hero. Selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease.  He is supported with a fine ensemble cast, including Suzy Amis as his embittered gritty wife, and Haley Joel Osment (of \"The Sixth Sense\" fame) in a minor role as Selleck\u0027s son.  Amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed.  Too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim, dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt.  Amis\u0027 portrayal as Mrs. Cable breaks the mould; we see her with dirt and dust on her face, with sweat dripping in lines across her face, and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands, or for that matter, a rifle.  I personally welcome this portrayal of western women, as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her muti-layered petticoats.  David and Keith Cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm.  Harry Carey Jr. plays a small role as Selleck\u0027s father-in-law.\n\nAs a collector of fine western films, I intend to keep \"Last Stand at Saber River\", as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great Hollywood westerns; it\u0027s not an epic, but it is fine film-making and will please those craving for a fine western drama. I recommend it.\n\nJames \"Konedog\" Koeni\n",
    "\nThis movie I consider to be akin to \u0027Vertigo\u0027 by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics \u0027Rear Window\u0027 in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire.\nHe slams the porn industry in some very funny ways. You will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes.\nWhat I liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end. I don\u0027t want to give away too much here, but a clever use of \u0027Hollywood Hijinks\u0027 and the line \u0027Don\u0027t believe everything you see\u0027 fit with the story very well.\n\u0027Postcards from the edge\u0027 was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be. In this film, DePalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be.\nAs in \u0027Dressed to Kill\u0027, DePalma relies on non-verbal acting to carry the story, and quite successfully too. The scene begins when Craig Wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he\u0027s been watching though a telescope. The scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach. I believe it\u0027s about 20 minutes. Played out well with body language and facial expressions, this scene couldn\u0027t work any other way.\nLike \u0027Vertigo\u0027, this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat. Maybe too much detail, not sure. I found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to continue.Not many movies attempt this slower approach, or do it in a way that makes it work.\nAll in all, definitely a must see. Keep in mind, the action is a bit slow at times.\nMelanie Griffith appears here and does a great job in her role, as do the other actors. Filming, camera angels and use of props all work well. The plot is complex. This is a must see for suspense/murder mystery fans\n",

    "\nWe have all heard about `Product Placement\u0027 especially in the James Bond films. Did you know it goes all the way back to DR. NO and was very prominent? In the scene where Bond kicks and tosses Quarrel and Puss Feller into a stack of corrugated cartons, notice that those cartons are labeled `Red Stripe.\u0027 That\u0027s right, `Red Stripe\u0027 Beer from Jamaica! In this case `Product Placement\u0027 was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film. \n\nIn fact DR. NO is one of the best films of the series. It is much closer to Ian Fleming\u0027s prose than most of the other films thanks to Sean Connery\u0027s performance, Richard Maibaum\u0027s scripting and Terence Young\u0027s direction. At the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here. Production designer Ken Adam\u0027s sets, attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional, adorned by Syd Cain\u0027s detailed Art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in DR. NO the benchmark. Peter Hunt\u0027s intuitive and effective quick-cut editing paced the film like no other at its time. Maurice Binder\u0027s brainchild opening `gun barrel\u0027 is an incredible piece of Title Design, which is equaled only by the `James Bond Theme\u0027, composed and re-orchestrated by Monty Norman and John Barry. Ted Moore\u0027s cinematography, especially the shot of bikini clad Ursula Andress emerging from the sea, is now a classic and also set a standard for future `Bond Girls.\u0027 \n\nWe are introduced to the organization known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in DR. NO. What is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by Joseph Wiseman. He is unlike future main villains of the series. He isn\u0027t exactly what you may call a `social animal\u0027. Joseph Wiseman\u0027s eerie and surreptitious portrayal made Dr. No one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series. In a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen Blofeld in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL. Rounded out by the beloved M portrayed by Bernard Lee, the lovely Miss Moneypenny played by Lois Maxwell, John Kitzmiller as Quarrel and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, DR. NO ranks as one of the best.\n\n",
    "\nThis movie was more than I expected. I was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects, and especially, the robots. You are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end. I did not expect it to be who it was. The reason why I rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from Smith. I was not prepared for it, especially since the movie is not rated PG-13 for language. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie.\n",
    "\n\"Kelly\u0027s Heroes\" is an odd, yet quite enjoyable war movie. This 1970\u0027s comedic, cinematic take on WWII, mixes genres such as the suicide mission/action film, the crime/caper film and the army comedy. In other words, take a lot of \"The Dirty Dozen\", mix a bit of \"Ocean\u0027s 11\" and add in some \"M*A*S*H\" plus \"Catch-22\" and you\u0027ll have \"Kelly\u0027s Heroes\". The film features a battered U.S. Army infantry unit, which has been on the front lines since landing at Omaha Beach. All they have on there minds is a little R\u0026R, that includes booze \u0026 broads. That is until Pvt. Kelly (Clint Eastwood) interrogates (with a bottle of brandy) a captured German intelligence officer, who tells him about a Nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars. Kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small French bank, that is being vigorously guarded by three Nazi \u0027Tiger\u0027 tanks. I know in this day and age it might sound rather odd, but this is one war movie, that is not only suspenseful, but is also a whole lot of fun! Is it an accurate portrayle of WWII? Probably not. (I doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the \"Big One\") This 1970 release pretty much through its\u0027 hilarious, sharp script  has more of a Vietnam era mentality, which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it\u0027s attitudes about war. Unlike the John Wayne style war films of the past, these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes, but they are just trying to make it through the war with their a**\u0027s intact (and maby make a little profit on the side). The film features a large, talented cast, some of whom, were already stars and others, who later went on to become big names in both television and film. This includes Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles, Caroll O\u0027Connor, Gavin MacLeod, Stuart Margolin, Harry Dean Stanton and Len Lesser (Uncle Leo from TV\u0027s \"Seinfeld\"). How can you go wrong with a cast like that? If your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs  mixed in, then I would highly recommend Kelly\u0027s Heroes\"\n",
    "\nIts hard to imagine that a war film can leave you with a big smile at the conclusion but here is one that will!\nWith non stop action, drama and comedy, Kellys Heroes has it all with a top notch cast and soundtrack to boot.\nThe original script of a bank heist behind enemy lines during WW2 is a classic and is brilliantly executed at all levels.\nEven though the film is based on a fictional plot, it still has an authentic feel and is rated an all time classic.\nhighly recommended\n",

Dont get me wrong the concert parts are so dope to hear my fav snoop classics and i was left with one question how did they get clearance from Suge to put out his Death Row classics, but this dvd shines as a replayable classic. You would be so so suprised at what is on this, see most people are happy getting a concert dvd like the up and smoke where snoop performs in one city, you watch it after fast forwarding through all the opening acts like westside connec and you dont have to watch it again for years...this is quite a different approach.  I was literally hurting from laughing so hard because this dvd gives you the bishop don juan, it gives you backstage, it gives you the norml conference...you cant even take it all in if you watched it once!  i say if you like snoop, if you like weed, if you like biatches and hiznoes, you got a winner with the puff puff pass\n",
    "\nMost of this movie is terrible, but who\u0027s complaining?  The epically long \"Begin the Beguine\" is the climax of the movie \u0026 it makes the whole mess worthwhile.  The last 11 minutes of this movie are mind-blowingly great -- absolute perfection.  The sets, the cinematography, the costumes, the orchestrations \u0026 the extraordinary routine itself -- everything combines to make \"Begin the Beguine\" the most ravishing, glamorous black \u0026 white production number ever put on film.  It\u0027s Hollywood at its apogee, the quintessence of silver screen glamor.  \n\nA few of the other numbers are fun: the first, \"Don\u0027t Monkey with Broadway\" is clever \u0026 pleasant; later on, Fred Astaire\u0027s lovely \"I\u0027ve Got My Eyes on You\" is also winning:  a charming routine that he dances to a delightful, cheerful orchestration.  Some other numbers are worth seeing, as well, but \"Begin the Beguine\" outshines everything else in this picture.\n\nIn between the numbers, there\u0027s a lot of dreary silliness afoot.  Happily, DVD technology makes it easy to skip over the dross \u0026 go straight for the gold.\n\nEleanor Powell was a very odd actress.  She was rather pretty \u0026 decidedly perky (how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality); she was also quite feminine.

But man oh man, could she dance! \n",

The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins.

    "\nI had often heard about Degrassi: The Next Generation. I went on to the show\u0027s website often, even though I didn\u0027t get the channel it shows on. I knew as much about the show that everyone else did, and I didn\u0027t even see the show. So after a year or two of trying to figure out how to I could see the show, I heard that they were making a DVD, and I was so excited! \n\nI ordered it on ebay a few months after it came out, and it was fairly priced. I watched all of it in a day, and I was ecstatic. This show is all about what it is really like being a teen. Nothing fake, but not over-dramatic. Giving life lessons on everything, like internet relationships, the effects of using ecstasy, presssure (beer), family, rumors, first dates, and all sorts of things. Season One is especially perfect for prettens and early teenagers because it is based around a group of 7th and 8th Graders.\n\nOf course, through the Seasons, the characters face changes and more dramatic situations, but somehow, there is always a Season for teens and Preteens of every age to relate to. And that\u0027s what everybody likes about the show. \n\nThis DVD also includes auditions for most cast members, which are fun to watch, bloopers and deleted scenes, which add more to the episode, and a karaoke of the theme song which is also very fun. With cast and characters biographies, you can tell that the creators of the DVDs put as much into them as possible, and it pays off.\n",
    "\nRonald Reagan might have gotten the nickname of the \"Gipper\" from this 1940 bio-pic of legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, but it was veteran character actor Pat O\u0027Brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead. James Cagney had lobbied hard for the role, but when the actor signed a petition supporting the Republican (and anti-Catholic) government in the Spanish Civil War, Notre Dame refused to okay him for the part. This was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in South Bend, and if you do know that the other one was \"Rudy\" you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one.\n\n\"Knute Rockne All American\", which was added to the National Film Registry in 1997, is a fairly standard bio-pic, evincing the almost documentary style that was standard at the time. We see how the young Rockne (played by Johnny Sheffield, a.k.a. Boy in the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies) learned to love football, revolutionized the game with the forward pass, and coached his alma mater to glory with the Four Horsemen and George Gipp. The result is a long series of episodes from Rockne\u0027s life that have varying degrees of appeal, such as when he picks up the idea for his backfield shift from watching chorus girls dance and experiments with the idea using his wife and their dinner guests.\n\nLots of footage of actual Notre Dame games are worked into the film, although I have no way of knowing if any of it is of the actual games being portrayed (I would be curious to know). O\u0027Brien\u0027s performance seems a tad wooden, but if you have ever seen actual film clips of Rockne you know he is in the ballpark. A lot of the charm of this film comes from the ethos of the original Rockne, an American legend who was probably the first famous victim of an airplane crash. The result is not great, but certainly compelling (plus we all learn the correct pronunciation of his name as being Ka-Nute).\n\nReagan\u0027s supporting role is deservedly memorable. That same year he would get to play third banana George Armstrong Custer to Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland in \"The Santa Fe Trail\" and would provide his best performance in \"King\u0027s Row\" before military service in World War II effectively derailed his acting momentum and ultimately set his life on a different path. \n\nFinal Note: While there is little doubt that Rockne invented the forward pass, there is debate over one aspect of this film. In his first scene as George Gipp, Reagan is sitting around doing nothing when Rockne orders him to go in at halfback to play against the varsity and run the ball. Gipp asks \"How far?\" and proceeds to run it back all the way. After crossing the goal line he bounces the ball off the endzone, instead of laying it down for the \"touchdown.\" An argument has been made that this was the first spike in the history of football. At least it is the first \"recorded\" spike. Did the current tradition of choreographed celebrations all stem from what Ronald Reagan did in this 1940 film? You decide if that is yet another part of the Reagan legacy that is being reconsidered this week\n",
    "\nIf no adjective appropriately suit this vivid collection of avant-garde films from the 20s and 30s, one reviewer came close in his chosen nomenclature: this one-of-a-kind-combilation, indeed, is \"indespensable\"!\n\nFor anyone interested in or in some way connected to film and film studies this box set is a true gem as well as an overwhelming visceral experience. One dare even call it \"edenic\". \n\nPacked with cinematic treats - ranging from early classics as Joris Ivens\u0027 \"Regen\", through film historical curiosities as Marcel Duchamps\u0027 \"Cinema An�mic\" and Richter\u0027s \"Rhytmus 21\" to absolute rarities such as Kirsanoff\u0027s \"M�nilmontant\" - this impressive collection of short experimental films guides you through all main avant-garde genres of the 1920s and 1930s. From impressionist masterpieces (\"M�nilmontant\", \"La glace a trois faces\" [Epstein]), through dadaist art-films (Duchamps), French and German cin�ma pur/Absolut Film (\"Symphonie Diagonale\" [Eggeling], \"Rhytmus 21\" [Richter]), futuristic statements (\"Ball�t mecanique\" [Leger]), dazzling city symphonies (\"Regen\") to such seminal early sound experiments as \"Romance Sentimentale\" (Eisenstein \u0026 Alexandrov) and \"Le tempestaire\" (Epstein).   \n\nWhile some films may, indeed, only be labled \"curiosities\" others are sheer strokes of genius - my personal favorites being Kirsanoff\u0027s rare impressionistic gem \"M�nilmontant\" (with its impressive - in every sense of the word - use of constant P.O.V.-shots, concealing the first person) and Jean Epsteins masterpiece \"Le tempestaire\" whose use of suspense-generating musique concr�te (or \"Slow-Motion Sound\", as it were) and vividly, picturesque imagery make for a unique cinematic experience. - As visceral as it is beautiful to behold.\n\nIf only for its lack of a few early classics (notably, Ren� Clair\u0027s \"Entr\u0027act\" [1924] and Luis Bu�uel\u0027s \"Un chien andalou\" [1929] and \"L\u0027�ge d\u0027or\" [1930]) this combilation of early experimental films may not be labeled \"perfect\". \n\nHowever, I am still to experience any other collection of its kind. For anyone studying film (whether by themselves or in University,) this box set may, indeed, only be ascribed the adjective \"indespensible\", as done also by a previous reviewer.\n",
    "\nA must-have for all Kate Rusby fans.  This beautifully-produced concert video is a pure winner, showcasing Rusby and her band at their best, before an adoring, appreciative English audience.  Several things are worth pointing out: first, what a delight to see how friendly and down-to-earth she is, and what a fine performer.  Authoritative, yet not stuffy or standoffish in any way, she presents these old trad ballads in a way that makes them seem like the most immediate and compelling of contemporary art... And, of course, the music is simply stunning -- the band plays sweet, but keeps things simple; it\u0027s warm and modern without muddling down in crossover pretensions, it\u0027s just simply lovely, lovely acoustic music.  Finally, there\u0027s the experience of seeing Rusby sing: is it possible such a perfect sound is coming out of that everyday-looking lass before you?  Guess so.  Now I\u0027ll have to redouble my efforts to see her when she plays live at a venue near me... I know it\u0027ll be a night to remember\n",

In the All-Stars pack you get to see A LOT more speacial features of things occured on the island but never made it into the broadcast.

    "\nI have been an Adult Swim viewer since Space Ghost CTC\u0027s early days. The Venture Brothers is probably my favorite of them all (The Brak Show was a riot also). I am in my 40\u0027s and so I can relate to all the jokes on the stuff I grew up on (Marvel, DC, Johnny Quest, Scooby Doo, etc). The formula started with SGCTC taking mundane kids 60\u0027s-70\u0027s shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references (many homosexual), uber violence for violence\u0027s sake, profanity (beeped out but you know what they are saying), well you get my drift (think excrement jokes). It\u0027s Ted Turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi American of good vs. bad in cartoons, and screwing it all to hell. But despite the same formula over and over (SGCTC, Harvey Birdman AAL, The Brak Show, Robot Chicken, Aqua Team Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and probably some others I missed), I still watch and laugh, with The Venture Brothers being the best of them all. One thing that I really laugh about is that the teens and gen X\u0027ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from, they are just laughing at the situations and don\u0027t get the parody. I tried to tell a co-worker (whose 25 years old) about a Robot Chicken bit about Hogan\u0027s Heroes and he never heard of that show!

My first job was in a restaurant much like Shenaniganz and perhaps that\u0027s why I found the movie so worth watching.\n\nThe game the employees play is over the top, but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on.

    "\nThis film burns the screen with power, sensitivity, unbreakable bonds and emotional connections that will blow your mind. Jolie and Burress shine in Foxfire in a way that you\u0027ll never forget. Every woman has been a girl, and, even if they store their feelings deep inside, they have to wish they had spent a few months like these girls. I know I do. But even guys have to relate to the realistic rebellious and connected spirit these girls reflect on-screen. Every character is well-developed. I wish I could change the ending of the movie, but that ending is what keeps things real. This movie is definitely a treasure\n",
    "\nFoxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world. The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don\u0027t care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her \u0026 Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don\u0027t like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She\u0027s astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina. \n\nAs a matter of fact, the entire cast turns in memorable performances. I think this is a great movie for women to watch but I don\u0027t know if men will enjoy it quite as much. I did see one male reviewer claiming he didn\u0027t find it to be just a chick flick, but he might be the minority. Guy or gal, if the story sounds intriguing to you, and it really is, then Foxfire is definitely worth checking out. I give it only 4 stars simply because the character of Maddy (wonderfully played by Hedy Burress) has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background. Left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with, but that\u0027s my only criticism.\n\nAt this price, it\u0027s a fabulous addition to your collection, though believe it or not, the low price right here on Amazon has been beaten by Wal-Mart...it\u0027s in the $5.50 bin. This is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing, but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe. Definitely recommended\n",
    "\nProbably the best place to start for Bergman initiates. Three decent films (although I think \"Through A Glass\" is in a different class to the other two features). Moreover, they all form a useful overview of the progression of Bergman\u0027s art from circa 1960 to circa \u002762; from the religious torment of 1961\u0027s \"Winter light\", through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of \"Through A Glass...\" to the explicit focus on familial relationships of \"The Silence\", (the latter reminiscent of Bergman\u0027s mid-to-late 60\u0027s output). In short, although there is nothing to match the astounding \"Persona\" (1966), the films do give a great indication as to Bergman\u0027s filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in Euroean Art House cinema of the early 1960s in general. \n\nDVD: Excellent Criterion transfers. The documentary disc a Swedish film about the production of \"Winter Light\") is excellent as well, worth watching alone for Bergman\u0027s casual conversations on his religious torment: he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread\n",

    "\nSoldier of Orange with commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven is a must-see for all history buffs, WWII historians and lovers of war movies.  Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema,  it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of  a small group of law students in Leiden, The Netherlands.  Verhoeven\u0027s commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray, while asking some very thought provoking questions.  Verhoeven and I are the same age, and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation.  His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different. I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate.  Having said all that, I still consider the DVD one of my most favorite productions, including the film itself.  Soldaat van Oranje is my choice for best ever Dutch film. Those interested in learning more about the real Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema should read \"Soldaat van Oranje Omnibus\" which includes \"De Verre Tamboer (The Distant Drummer)\" and \"Op Jacht naar het Leven (In pursuit of Life)\" all by Eric Hazelhoff Roelfzema\n",
    "\nYet another amazing film from Paul Verhoeven with so much depth and weight I can\u0027t even tell you.  Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do.  Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role.  Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films.  So many great scenes (i.e. Alex and Eric\u0027s tango towards the end, \u0026quot;april fools day\u0026quot;, vengeance on a bicycle, the beach scene and many many more.)  See this as soon as possible.  It would make a terrific double feature with the Young Lions\n",
    "\nThis is a wonderful collection of horror pictures made by MGM and Warner Brothers during the Thirties. Neither studio was noted for horror pictures, but the ones they did make are unforgettable to fans of the genre as well as late night movie addicts. Following is a synopsis of the films contained in the collection:\n\nTHE MASK OF FU MANCHU (MGM, 1932) - Boris Karloff is wonderfully creepy as Sax Rohmer\u0027s evil genius, Dr. Fu Manchu. It would not be the last time Karloff played a Chinese, as he later starred as Mr. Wong in Monogram\u0027s low budget detective series later in the decade.  The plot concerns a race between good guy Lewis Stone and Fu Manchu to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan. If Fu Manchu gets there first he will possess the magical relics placed there which, in turn, will allow him to enslave the world. Look for a young Myrna Loy in a delightful turn as Fu\u0027s diabolical, and scantily-clad, daughter.\n\nDOCTOR X (WB, 1932) - A good early effort by Michael Curtiz concerning the \"Moon Killer\" murders in which the victims are strangled, cannibalized and surgically dissected under the light of the full moon. Wise-cracking reporter Lee Tracy traces the clues to a spooky seaside mansion, where Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill) and his colleagues are conducting strange experiments. Made in early two-strip Technicolor, the film is wonderfully atmospheric, and the sets themselves will linger in your mind. Aside from the irritating Lee Tracy as reporter Lee Taylor, the acting is crisp and to the point. Atwill in particular is eerie. Fay Wray is good as Xavier\u0027s daughter. I won\u0027t give any more of the plot away, but just remember the phrase \"synthetic flash.\" Once heard, it will linger in the mind always. \n \nMARK OF THE VAMPIRE (MGM, 1935) - Tod Browning\u0027s remake of his \"London After Midnight\" with Bela Lugosi as the vampire, Count Mora, and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Newman. In the original, both roles were played by Lon Chaney. The plot concerns the death of Sir Karell Borotyn, who appears to have been killed by vampire Count Mora. Fearing that the vampire\u0027s next victim will be Borotyn\u0027s daughter, Irena (Elizabeth Allan), vampire expert Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore) is called I to protect her and shed some light on the goings-on. Look for Carroll Borland as the Count\u0027s daughter (a role played by Edna Tichenor in the original).\n\nMAD LOVE (MGM, 1935) - One of the great plots in horror film history, and one that has been repeated many times. Colin Clive plays the brilliant concert pianist Stephen Orlac, whose hands are crushed in a train accident. His wife, Yvonne, is a noted stage actress whose ardent admirer is Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre). Although she rejected Gogol previously, she is forced to seek his help in restoring her husband\u0027s hands. Gogol replaces Orlac\u0027s hands with those of executed knife thrower Rollo, and the fun begins. Clive is his usual tortured, neurotic self and Lorre is brilliant as the oily monomaniacal Gogol. Pauline Keal, in her book on Citizen Kane, stated that Welles copied Lorre\u0027s look for the older Kane.\n\nTHE DEVIL DOLL (MGM, 1936) - Tod Browning\u0027s last great film is about as respected Parisian banker (Lionel Barrymore), who is framed for robbery and murder and sent to Devil\u0027s Island. Years later he escapes in the company of a scientist who has discovered a way to shrink living things to one-sixth their original size. Barrymore finds a new use for the scientist\u0027s discovery as a means of revenge on those who had framed him.\n\nTHE RETURN OF DOCTOR X (WB, 1939) - The famous Humphrey Bogart punishment picture! After years of complaining about his one-dimensional gangster roles, it was said that Jack Warner decided to teach Bogie a lesson and put him in the role of a vampiric lab assistant who needs freshly drained blood in order to stay alive. Bogart is a hoot in pasty-faced white makeup and a grey streak through his hair. Wayne Morris play the wise-cracking reporter who exposes Bogie as the killer. (Tough job considering the makeup). Look for Olin Howard (Jensen the drunk in Them! and the Blob\u0027s first victim) as the undertaker. This film has never before been released on either VHS or DVD, so it is a welcome find for horror fans and Bogart fans as well\n",
    "\nIn my opinion; there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of Martin Short\u0027s humor with the exception of, \"Clifford\". My then teen children and I spilt our sides laughing at Short\u0027s work when we first saw this film! Several times we laughed so hard at a scene; we couldn\u0027t go on until we replayed the scene several times over. We were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter! All three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored. Even if you are not a big fan of Martin Short; you will enjoy, \"Clifford\"\n",
    "\nI was so disappointed they cancelled this series. I was hoping that the SciFi channel would pick it up. Hope you science finction lovers got this one because it\u0027s GREAT\n",
    "\nIt is movie about the strength of friendship and how three men carry out a promise to a dying friend.How men will fight to the end for a dream of one man.The characters drew strength from one another.It tells about the hardships of the old west.The unfortunate greed of men and how greed can kill.Tom Selleck\u0027s character showed the the ability to love a woman and his love of his friends.The other characters complimented each other.The movie was well worth the price.You will want more of the same\n",
    "\nRegarding the above title, there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the Dvd. There seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the USA and the UK as they do very little to the film\u0027s context. Still, it\u0027s a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore (if that\u0027s what you\u0027re into) and I\u0027d still give it a 9 1/2 out of 10\n",
    "\nTCM III was a good movie.It had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.It lacked the essential characters,though.It would\u0027ve done better if they had brought Chop Top or Drayton back to life.The film is about two friends headed down to Florida from Texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.We already know it was Leatherface,and the two drive on.The next day,they come upon a gas station,where a crazy,yet funny gas station attendant named Alfredo work.Also making his appearance here as well is Viggo Mortenson as Tex,a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.The two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods,pursued by the evr vigialnt Leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.It gets the job done every time.As in the Texas Chainsaw tradition,they are captured and prepared for dinner.One of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on Leatherface with the help of an Veteran they met along the way.It\u0027s an overall good movie and I loved it\n",
    "\nMy 2 and 3 year old boys really enjoyed this DVD.  This Backyardigans DVD is their favorite so far (they have the 2 others Snow Fort and It\u0027s Great to be a Ghost also).  The music is lively but not loud and obnoxious like some kid\u0027s videos. It introduces kids to different styles of music and has great characters whose behaviors you don\u0027t mind your children copying. The Backyardigans are one of my favorite shows for them to watch.  \n",
    "\nLove it...love them all.  Disagree about the pace of this one.  Heart of the Jungle is great even though it is slower and you have to own this one just to get the Tea Party show.\n\nIt is a must have.  Even if it is just for Polka Palace which is great unto itself. \n",
    "\nI cannot recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie, which is my favourite from the 1980\u0027s by far. The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in \"Big Business\",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood\u0027s Golden Age. A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn\u0027t seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory. The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in \"Big Business\", it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York\u0027s business world.\n\nThe story begins in a flash back when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton are passing through rural backwater Jupitor Hollow when Binky goes into labour. At the same time locals Garth and Iona Ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of Sadie and Rose but are also mixed up. We move forward forty years to where Sadie Shelton is the corporate head of Moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of Holomade, the local industry in Jupitor Hollow. Getting wind of their plans the militant Jupitor Hollow resident Rose Ratliff decides to go fight these \"Pinstriped Trouser Snakes\", on their own territory and Sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring Jupitor Hollow. Through a mix up they end up staying in the Plaza Hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as \"sinks in the living room\", and \"soaps in the shapes of swans\"! Complication piles on top of complication as Sadie Shelton\u0027s ex husband Michael (Barry Primus), can\u0027t believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural Sadie for his hard nosed wife and Jay Marshall(Michael Gross), can\u0027t for the life of him understand why Rose (Ratliff) is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure Rose (Shelton). All comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two Sadie\u0027s are really the city Sheltons while the two Rose\u0027s are really the twins meant to be in Jupitor Hollow. The fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when Sadie (Shelton), is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to Sadie (Ratliff), to put all her watching of her idol Alexis Carrington in \"Dynasty\", to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing Jupitor Hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully. \n\nClassic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins, on the classic 1960\u0027s comedy series \"The Patty Duke Show\". I dont think I\u0027ve ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in \"Big Business\". Her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails Sadie Shelton who\u0027s all \"hostile takeovers\" to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin Sadie Ratliff who only wants to be able to say \"keep the change!\" is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter. Her classic mirror sequence with her \"twin\", is a total riot and her statement that \"this whole thing has got UFO written all over it!\",will have you breaking up with laughter. Equally Lily Tomlin as both country activist Rose Ratcliff, \"I\u0027m gonna go kick some snooty New York Ass!\", and as Rose Shelton the awkward out of place city girl \"I hate shopping and I hate New York in June!\",is also top rate. Her rejection of Jay\u0027s engagement ring as a supposed \"bribe\" and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a \"great big belly scraping pile of cow plop!\", is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene I never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening I have of this movie. Of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at New York\u0027s Plaza Hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up. Two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk\u0027s (Joe Grifasi), continual mixing up of Sadie Shelton/Ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined, and especially Fabio Alberici\u0027s (Michele Placido), total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers, the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone! The hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women (one from the country and the other from the city), seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff. It is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first. Classics like: \"Im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease!\",\"Oh my God it\u0027s so COSMOpolitan\", \"Oh sure its full of crowds, smog, sex fiends, and white slavers, it\u0027s a pistol, I\u0027ve got about as much use for it (New York), as a Toad has for spit pearls!\", \"Computer chips, they\u0027ve got their ways!\", and \"Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase?\", are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script. \n\nTotal escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more. It is a real pity that \"Big Business\", so far has marked the only time that Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle. This film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages. I\u0027ve been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as I am! So I\u0027d say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven\u0027t already. You wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends, in Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in \"Big Business\". Enjoy!   \n",
    "\nWhile Elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video, that is not the only good thing about this one.  It features several shorts with cartoons and different characters.  My favorite part of the video (and my daughter\u0027s) is the part featuring Ernie and Bert.  Ernie decides he is going to be a doctor, and needs Bert\u0027s help so he can practice doing the things doctors do.  Bert just wants to know if he is healthy, and after putting him through several tests, Ernie says that he doesn\u0027t know if Bert is healthy or not because he isn\u0027t a doctor-but he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not!  The cartoons are funny, and there is a never before seen Elmo\u0027s World at the end all about doctors, too.  Very cute\n",

The concept is utterly ridiculous...2 stoner community college kids mistake an enclosed environment, the bio-dome, for a mall and get trapped inside for a year.

    "\nMasterful pretty much says it all. I agree with the reveiwers who rated it \"one of the best all time movies\"---not just among westerns. This film is Wayne\u0027s HIGH NOON. The hard edges play well with today\u0027s viewers and the things we confront. You will travel with the Duke as he is consumed by hate. He\u0027s not out to save the young lady, but to destroy her. What will happen when he is face to face with her? Watch and enjoy a great film!  If you are looking for a new western I highly recomemend \"Broken Trail!\n",
    "\n\nAn exercise in self-aggrandizement, but done so well it\u0027s forgivable. Set in London circa 1910, Chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill. One day as he stumbles home drunk, he smells gas, and rescues a young girl (Claire Bloom) from a suicide attempt. He nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career. Between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat, Chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past, including a great sketch with Buster Keaton in which he plays the fiddle and Keaton the piano (it was both their swan songs). The movie is autobiographical and reeks of self-importance, with a number of references to Chaplin\u0027s carrer in pictures alluded to. But there\u0027s intelligence, too, and not a little sentimentality (what Chaplin picture doesn\u0027t contain this?), but Chaplin is such a demanding master that there isn\u0027t a moment of sloughing off or cheapness. Chaplin did everything, from writing the script to composing the music, and all of it is touched with genius. Made in 1952, the movie, amazingly, was not seen in Hollywood until 1972.\n",
    "\nMany shows have their moments, but this is the first show I\u0027ve ever laughed OUT LOUD, multiple times in one episode.  The humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed.  I will say that you do need to be around my age (I\u0027m 40) to get alot of the inside jokes, but if you do their hilarious.  And if you don\u0027t there\u0027s still plenty to make you laugh.  I would HIGHLY recommend all three Volumes that are out now\n",
    "\n(Just as a note, that\u0027s the Japanese title)\n\nThere\u0027s something about this movie that I\u0027ve always liked. I\u0027m not sure what it is, but being a Pokemon fan, of course I like it. The movie have always been great, and this one has something that I really like about it. \n\nThe movie starts out in the North Pole, with a scientist named Dr. Lund, his friend Yuko, and his son, Tory. There is suddenly an explosion, and Tory is trampled by a frightened pack of Walrein. And, as they say, after that, all heck broke looks.\n\nA meteor is the reason for the explosion, and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average Pokemon. Deoxys, a rare Pokemon from another planet (woah, more than one Poke-Planet? Niiice.) The strange creature, carrying a rock with a gem inside, is suddenly attacked by the large, dragon-esque Rayquaza, a frequenter of the Ozone Layer. So, what the heck is he here for?\n\nAh, So Rayquaza feels threatened by Deoxys, and so, both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle. (With some pretty cool background music, might I add.) So, professor Lund flees with his colleages, and son.\n\nFour years later, a young Pokemon trainer named Ash Ketchum, along with some friends, enter the high tech city of La Rousse, and as fate would have it, Tory\u0027s hometown. And, well, I won\u0027t spoil it from there. The plot is good, and Deoxys\u0027 \u0027destructive\u0027 intentions are less cruel than one would think. Don\u0027t worry, folks, no angsty Mewtwo-copy here.\n\nAlso, Rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie. His fights against Deoxys are totally awesome. The soundtrack is also great. I really love the music played during The opening scenes of the movie, and the fights between Rayquaza and Deoxys. The animation is very spiffy, shiny bright and new :P. \n\nI haven\u0027t had the pleasure of watching the original Japanese version of the movie, but when I do, I\u0027ll tell you all about it, \u0027kay?\n\nWell, I guess that pretty much wraps things up. Oh yes, Tory\u0027s afraid of pokemon, due to the whole \u0027get attacked by a herd of walrein\u0027 thing. Heh. Okay then, Sayanora, faithful readers!\n",
    "\nI did not have many expectations when this came out as a movie but was pleasantly surprised! The dvd was a must own as soon as it came out\n",
    "\nWrath Of The Dragon.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nThe Dragon Ball Z series is one of the finest animes out there, as any fan of Japanese animation will tell you. The series has a \"love it or hate it\" reputation, but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons. Young people love the series for the fast-paced action and adventure, while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters, and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time. It\u0027s no wonder the series is considered Akira Toriyama\u0027s magnum opus, and by far the best of the three Dragon Ball series. When Toei animation made Dragon Ball into an anime, they didn\u0027t copy Toriyama\u0027s mangas verbatim. They added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga, often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace. Toei even created movies based on the series! There were thirteen movies, two television specials, and one OVA/OAV. While not usually canon to the storyline, they are an undeniable part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise that can\u0027t be ignored.\n\nOVERVIEW:\nThis is the thirteenth of the thirteen Dragon Ball Z movies. \n\nTHE STORY:\nMajin Buu is beaten. Our heroes have won. Peace has returned.\n\nYeah, right. \n\nJust as everyone has settled down, Gohan and Videl rescue an old suicidal man, and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the Dragon Balls. What they don\u0027t know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe. The Z Fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe. But are they strong enough?\n\nREVIEW OF STORY:\nThis is one of my favorite Dragon Ball Z movies, due in no small part to the unique storyline, and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular. Granted, I wish Vegeta had a larger role, but no big complaints there. There is no other part of the Dragon Ball Z series that has a storyline anything like this. The interaction between Trunks and Tapion is excellent as well. And the ending? Let\u0027s just say it stands on a plane all its own. You won\u0027t want to miss it.\n\nOFFICIAL?\nThis is a rare example of a Dragon Ball Z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline. Right after the defeat of Buu, this would fit into the actual series continuity. It didn\u0027t exist in the original manga so I consider it unofficial, but you be the judge.\n\nREVIEW OF DVD:\nAll of FUNimation\u0027s Dragon Ball Z DVDs are pretty much the same as far as content goes. There is no bonus content, unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the DVD to be bonus material. And honestly, I could have lived without them. Some more recent DVDs have character profiles, though these are lacking and could have been written better. Why couldn\u0027t get get interviews with cast and crew, or trivia/facts, something like that? FUNimation has a lot of room to improve on the DVDs.\n\nTHE DUBBED VERSION:\nLots of people tend to bash FUNimation\u0027s dub of the Dragon Ball Z series? Why? It\u0027s inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid. They can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes, such as Full Metal Alchemist, but every time they\u0027ve tried dubbing Toriyama\u0027s classic, they butcher it to hell. The nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series. Stick with the uncut subbed track.\n\nOVERALL:\nGet it. Dragon Ball Z movies don\u0027t get any better than this.\n\nEDITION NOTES:\nIt was released in edited and uncut versions. Do I even have to say it? Get uncut. And watch the subtitled Japanese version.\n",
    "\nI really liked this DVD...has a lot of information and covered a lot of their important games. The special features are interesting, as well\n",
    "\nI was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The sex scenes were some of the best I\u0027ve seen because they were graphic yet very realistic. The story was touching and honest.

    "\nI am a huge Chef! fan. I have been watching the show since it was on BBC America and my local PBS station. I was excited to find that the \"Complete Collection\" was finally available on DVD. I got the package and could not wait to start watching the show and that is when the dissappointment sat in. I realized that shows were missing from the \"Complete Collection\" like: Divorice?, Gareth\u0027s Father and the Christmas Special \"A Bird in the hand\". Can someone please tell me how this can be the \"Complete Collection\" with those episodes ommitted from the DVD?\n",
    "\nI thought this was an excellent, excellent film. I saw it for the first time last night, and I was struck by how well it was acted and filmed. (It was directed by Jean Renoir, so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation, but it was exceptionally good.) In response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors, I would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized (the prison rooms looked like slightly-dingy hotel rooms, and the treatment of the prisoners.)However, one should realize how different World War One was from World War Two or other more recent wars. WWI had a few decent reasons for being fought, but primarily it was about European countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings. As seen in this film and \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", (and the poetry of e.e. cummings) many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches. They fought for the ideals of their respective countries, but separated from the propaganda, your enemy could be your neighbor. In WWII, there was an obvious evil (genocide) to fight against that needed to be defeated, but WWI had mostly stereotypes to lend menace. \n\"Grand Illusion\", like \"The Rules of the Game\" reflects the decline of the great aristocratic families of Europe that was occuring during and after WWI. Ancient families that had controled dynasties for centuries were left without the power they had held. The world moved on and left them in anachronism, a reality which Von Rauffenstein and Boieldieu foresee. Much of the film is focused on the universality of the human condition. It doesn\u0027t deny the differences between people, but it shows how the connections between people can transcend some of these barriers when faced with the reality of war\n"

I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.\n\nThe picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I\u0027m very happy\n",
    "\nMy new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.\n\nMy cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in \u003d garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\n\nThe quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.\n\nSet-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\n\nAll in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner\n",
    "\nSo, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn\u0027t work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn\u0027t find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn\u0027t matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It\u0027s not a night-and-day difference, but it\u0027s a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \nThis product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it\u0027s control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I\u0027ll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \n\nMy recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it\u0027s not an option and you don\u0027t want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\n",
    "\nI have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it\u0027s biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an \u0026quot;ABC\u0026quot; book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use\n",

I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations.\n\nNo lag while playing my Playstation 2 console...\n\nThe only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press \"SOURCE\" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it\u0027s annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it\u0027s a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space\n",

    "\nThe intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I\u0027m drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I\u0027ve heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it\n",

    "\nI wouldn\u0027t be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That\u0027s all there is to it, that\u0027s what it does and it does it well. \n\nOn the down side, and it\u0027s a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you\u0027d sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don\u0027t like the attachment to the neck strap, I don\u0027t like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\n\nI use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don\u0027t have an issue. \n\nIf Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it\u0027s a bit lacking here\n",

    "\nThis is an excellent machine.  I bought two of them.  There are a few things you need to do.  I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVD-R up to 8x.  I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\n\nOne of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\n\nGet one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made!  Throw away your VCRs forever!  Just remember to baby them\n",
    "\nI bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I\u0027m sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can\u0027t go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn\u0027t seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I\u0027m still going to give it a full 5 stars..it\u0027s not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.  Really, if you\u0027re new to this technology, you\u0027re not going to have any problems..believe me..A++\n",
    "\nThe other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.

A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that\u0027s not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a solution, but just can\u0027t figure it out.  Any tips\n",

I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well.

    "\nI\u0027ve owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).\n\nPLUSES: \ndecent sound\ngood functionality\neasy set-up and intuitive operation\nsimple remote -- but only covers basic functions\n\nCONS:\nvery short speaker leads\nunattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox\nonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units\n\nAt first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can\u0027t expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven\u0027t blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.\n\nI originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn\u0027t have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality\n",

    "\n(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)\n\nMajor modes of operation are:\n\n1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up)\n2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)\n3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)\n4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a \"virtual\" cable; you need two to get the job done)\n\nA pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian\u0027s comment that this wouldn\u0027t work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.\n\nI rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.\n\n1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment!\n2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well, it\u0027s not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.\n3. Something that 99% of the world won\u0027t care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it\u0027s attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this\n",

    "\nI got this jacket a month into having my ipod.  I had to buy it because I had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when I pulled the iPod out of that case it was easy to drop.  One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs.\n\nThis case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine.  My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out.  It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction.  Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface.\n\nIt will protect your pod though\n",
    "\nThe product works perfectly.  The only problem is, the manual only includes directions for the most common setups.  To use one port as an \"uplink\" to a router, for example, you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled \"1\" and then leave port \"2\" open.  The directions do not state this, and I had to call Linksys to get it to work.\n\nOther than that, it is fast, reliable, and small.  Perfect\n",
    "\nMy setup:\n- Dell Latitude PP01L (Intel chip)\n- Win XP Pro\n- D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router (with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna)\n- Enabled the WEP feature\n\nI unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in.  Windows found the new card and did its Plug-n-Play thing.  Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately, but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn\u0027t \u0027see\u0027 with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card.  This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers.\n\nThe CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D-Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up-to-date.  I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D-Link card. I\u0027ve never had a problem with D-Link\u0027s website (or customer service, while we\u0027re on the subject), so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D-Link\u0027s site.  \n\nEither way...  install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates.\n\nBe sure to enable the encryption feature.  If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can\u0027t go snooping through your stuff.  Or worse, lift the signal, and ultimately your personal information.\n\nI\u0027ve had no problems with my current set-up.  I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop up-to-date\n",
    "\nThis review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. \nThe cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. \n\nIn short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk\n",

    "\nFor those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful.  Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc.  It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one.\n\nOne of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section.\n\nI record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station\u0027s tape deck to my iRiver.\n\nFor those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it\u0027s a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before -- you can\u0027t change it on the fly.\n\nI\u0027ve recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on.  Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.\n\nI\u0027ve also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I\u0027m still refining with later iRiver products.\n\nThe single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved!\n\nThe negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive.\n\nFiles are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don\u0027t know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can\u0027t trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don\u0027t think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.\n\nAlso, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.\n\nI\u0027ve had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I\u0027m only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses, it\u0027s starting to wear out.  But it\u0027s still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.\n\nI have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it.  Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.\n\nI\u0027m quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future\n",

I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It\u0027s actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked.

Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.

    "\nI have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \n\nThe variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \n\nThe only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don\u0027t need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can\u0027t say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won\u0027t regret it.\n",

    "\nWith boys aged 2 \u0026 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I\u0027m driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn\u0027t take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children\u0027s cds in the car I don\u0027t always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I\u0027m very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \n\nThis product repairs a disc to \"useable\" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It\u0027s also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \n\nI agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. \n",

I can\u0027t tell you how many pieces of junk I\u0027ve bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don\u0027t think you have a choice but to pick up this radio\n",

    "\nThis was my second DLO transpod. I had an older white one that I bought used. I figured I would \"upgrade\" to this one since my iPod and my car\u0027s interior are black. overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one, but with a few little changes.\n\nFor one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts. That normally doesn\u0027t matter if you choose a good empty frequency, but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect. \n\nNext, I can\u0027t turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.\n\nLast, the most annoying part of this whole product, is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use. I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back, as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.\n\nSince my car doesn\u0027t leave me many options for stereo replacement, this is the best product for my specific situation, though I may try and get that old one back from my friend...maybe an \"upgrade\" to a newer one will settle the deal\n",

    "\nThe reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...\n\nI could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.\n\nTons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  \n\nReally easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.\n\nDid I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.\n\nBest of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.\n\nThe end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver\n",
    "\nThis item does exactly what it\u0027s suppose to do. It also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception. Worth the money. Only drawback would be, there is a lot of cord hanging around\n",
    "\nThe Sony SS-MF650H are a low-cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.\n\nThough I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.\n\nThe sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don\u0027t get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\n\nThe bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don\u0027t worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won\u0027t suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\n\nIgnore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\n\nYou get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\n\nI would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you\u0027re willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.\n\nI also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you\u0027re looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\n",
    "\nI listen to a wide range of music, from hard rock, techno/electronic, to classical, and I\u0027ve found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this -- at least until I ordered this set.  I was apprehensive about buying online (and also about the Sony brand for speakers), but I\u0027m very happy with this purchase.  I\u0027ve been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course, this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I\u0027d definitely recommend this speaker set\n",

The only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage-free from Amazon, diminishing its \"bargain\" appeal somewhat.)\n\nThese modest-sized and priced speakers perform as advertised: the sound is more than adequate; they\u0027re small enough that I can take The Stephen Colbert Report  with me on walks; when not in use, they fold up into a mini Porta-John. My only misgiving is whether I should have spent 2-3X more for a unit with a dock connector. But for under twenty bucks you simply won\u0027t find a better sounding, more compact unit\n",

    "\nThese headphones are lightweight, fairly comfortable, and sound head and shoulders better than any pair of $20 headphones I\u0027ve ever heard.  Here are the aspects people always want to know about:\n\nBASS: these don\u0027t pound your eardrums in, but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I\u0027ve heard.  You can really follow the bass line with these, rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration.\n\nMIDS/HIGHS: this is the reason to buy these headphones.  Not too bright, but very clear, warm, smooth, soothing, and musical.  The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I\u0027d never heard before on that song.  In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones.\n\nThese obviously can\u0027t play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don\u0027t think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.

(disclaimer: I am not an audio professional, nor do I have any expensive headphones to compare with.)\n\nThey have great detail in both low and high end. In fact, I can hear things in some of my music that I never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam on-ear style or earbud styles.  This is good when listening to original CDs, or HQ mp3/AAC, but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that I had just not heard before...\n\nI tested these with a frequency response program on my Mac, show as having 25-15,600 Hz (in my ears, your ears may vary...) .  This range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds.\n\nThey do a good job of blocking out external noises-- great if you are in a bit of a noisy space.\n\nAnd, yes, they were a bit tight on the head initially.  To fix that, I got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches (pun intended). This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.

    "\nI bought these headphones a week ago and I am very pleased with them. At the electronic store, I listen to 3 pairs of Sennheiser (HD-433 ; HD-437 and HD-457). I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\nI do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\nOverall, I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\nWhen it comes to music, I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\nVery good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong. I highly recommand them for computer users (music, DVD movies and games)\n",

    "\nIt\u0027s not listed in the product description but the Pico works with the iPod Mini too.  Like the other reviewers, I found it easy to setup: tune the radio, turn on iPod, connect the Pico, tune the Pico, done).  In my car, the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae, or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality, my other car has a built-in iPod connector.  The Pico sound quality is comparable, somewhat muted, but enjoyable.  The Pico does offer the advantage of displaying the iPod menu to select tunes.  I\u0027ve read mixed reviews on other FM transmitters, but I am pleased with the Pico\n",
    "\nI ordered this device to sit on a player piano, which can play ipod encoded MP3 files, once they are transferred from the special CDs that are designed for the piano.

It allows me to sit across the room and pause the piano or select the next piece of music\n",
    "\nI was looking for an inexpensive, yet high quality, long lasting, and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane. A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter\n",

If you can\u0027t find it, you might want to buy a phone with less buttons and less features. And it\u0027s pretty simple to redial a number in the CID display... when you see/get to the number press Enter twice (Once to bring up the \"MENU\", and Once more to \"DIAL\"). In fact you can also save that number into the phone\u0027s memory through the menu (press Enter once and scroll through the options)\n",
    "\nAt first, I was not sure about if this Windshield Mounting Bracket was going to stay in place while I drive trough the streets. However, I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another, even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment, and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise.\n\nPros: Strong suction rubber system, GPS mounting system\nCons: Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane, so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that\u0027s why I give 4 stars\n",

    "\nI was paranoid about having buyer\u0027s remorse from this unit. For such a cheap price I was sure I would end up regretting the purchase. What is the tradeoff? Shoot if know, but I haven\u0027t regretted buying it one bit. The receiver is perfect for home theater, particularly DD 5.1 shows. There is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content, which is important for TV watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments.\n\nAs for power, it\u0027s not an even match with some of the more power hungry and expensive analog amplifiers out there, but it easily crosses the threshold of annoying the neighbors.\n\nDigital is something to get used to. On conventional receivers, you turn the sound up high and it becomes somewhat sloppy, or what some call \"warm\". Not so with the digital Panny. It\u0027s distortion free up to very high levels. I wouldn\u0027t call it bright, but the response is very linear and precise. I like hearing all the details in music and cinema, even at loud volume. Others don\u0027t.\n\nThe weaknesses are very minor:\n\n-The FM tuner is nothing special.\n-It lacks fancy DSP modes of expensive receivers.\n-No fancy on screen display (must do most of the tweaking with knobs)\n-It does not upconvert video.\n-The remote control is an el cheapo.\n\nFor this price, though, who cares\n",
    "\nI purchased this receiver from Fry\u0027s Electronics in San Diego, CA for $199.99. At first, I was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver. When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it\u0027s home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30\u0027s as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections. BUY IT!!!\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn\u0027t as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it\u0027s not nearly as soft as some I\u0027ve seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don\u0027t need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn\u0027t be happier\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve had these headphones for just over two years, and I\u0027m happy to see that they\u0027re one of the few pairs marketed as \"surround sound\" that have done quite well. The reason behind that is because they\u0027re truly excellent headphones. The range is spectacular and the inputs even more so. You\u0027re given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical), which is all you really need. \n\nMovies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind, in front, and to your left and right when you\u0027re connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds \u0027boomier\u0027 and a tad crisper than Dolby D does, especially in Gladiator. \n\nHonestly, I\u0027ve nothing to complain about. As a college guy, I couldn\u0027t bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which, I might add, never sounded as good as my headphones, mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You\u0027d be amazed at Coldplay\u0027s \"The Scientist\" if you heard it on these headphones. It\u0027s indescribable.\n\nAnd by the way, I\u0027m a slight audiophile.\n\nYou seriously can\u0027t go wrong with these headphones. And $65 for each additional pair of headphones, allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station? Even better...good idea for families in apartments.\n\nIncredibly advanced technology, incredible sound, and incredible results. Can\u0027t go wrong here.\n\nOh, and they\u0027re extremely comfy\n",
    "\nI just recently purchased the Quickcam STX for my sister who lives overseas in Greece. It\u0027s a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis.

The fit is great, of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected)\n",
    "\nThis is my second FM transmitter and works much better than the Belkin that I ended up returning because it simply wasn\u0027t working.\n\nIt plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there, unlike the Belkin (I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci). It is easy to use with the preset FM stations. It works right out of the box, you\u0027ll be ready to go within seconds. The sound is crisp, with some static interference, which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car\u0027s antenna helps a little but doesn\u0027t completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.\nThere is nothing to mount the iPod so you\u0027ll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t spend more than $45 on any FM transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas. I won\u0027t be getting rid of my CD changer just yet\n",
    "\nI have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord.\n\nStrengths: Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3!  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it.  \nThe other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \nThe battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \nWiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed\nJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.\n\nWeaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it\u0027s way better)\n\nProblems: Don\u0027t use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\n\nConclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well\n",

In fact, the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended.\n\nMy recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted, to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic.  Bose replaced them with no hassles, no receipt, no registration, just sent them back and got a brand new pair.  I think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago\n",
    "\nI recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It\u0027s great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative\u0027s website).  I\u0027m very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it\u0027s playing or not.  There\u0027s even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3\u0027s, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\n",
    "\nAgain, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    \ni tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.\nright now, im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano, then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.\n one more thing, if your going to use the line-in cable for a device other than the zen micro, be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers line-in jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review. \nI love these speakers and i even use them for my t.v and they sound great for that too\n",

    "\nEchoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don\u0027t wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven\u0027t put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.\n\nLearning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\n\nIt may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does, and success is not guaranteed.  But it\u0027s worth it! And to save your hearing, don\u0027t forget to turn down the volume, since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise\n",
    "\nThis was the largest set that would fit into my space. I also looked at the Westinghouse 37 inch HD moniter at Best Buy. The first time, I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy. Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp. I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD, the picture is amazing. It\u0027s also quite good on regular TV. \nMy only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in.

    "\nI purchased this radio to keep on my kitchen counter.  I chose Boston Acoustics over Tivoli because you can\u0027t preset the stations in the Tivoli and I like to flip through commercials. Other reviewers wrote that the bass can be overpowering.  I listen to rock music and do not notice the bass. My complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly.  It does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house.  Also if you are listening to the radio you can\u0027t see the time display.\n\nThis radio is great if you have limited space.  It looks good and sounds like a much larger radio. It has a lot of power for a small radio.\n",

That was enough for me. My speakers are bi-wired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful.

    "\nFor the background, I\u0027ve owned \u0026 used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75.  Here\u0027s my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:\n\nPros:\n1. Very good bass \u0026 well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\n2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I\u0027d need to crank up the vol.)\n3. Very light weight\n4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\n5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p \u0026iM716 have better isolation)\n6. Moderately priced ($50)\n\nCons:\n1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\n2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\n3. No pouch or case\n\nPS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80\u0027s experience :\n",
    "\nAll in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it\u0027s physics, there\u0027s nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \n\nThese headphones are called \"asymmetric,\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn\u0027t spill on the wire.\n\nI paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\n",

    "\nI love the new nanos. I don\u0027t think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I\u0027d rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren\u0027t as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don\u0027t know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don\u0027t notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I\u0027m so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star\n",

    "\nThese Verbatim discs have the DataLife Plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100+ years. I\u0027m a professional photographer and it\u0027s crucial to store my client\u0027s digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come. I\u0027ve tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data (read errors) many times but so far with the hundreds of Verbatim discs I\u0027ve burned so far, I haven\u0027t had a problem yet. The Kodak brand discs were also excellent, but Kodak discontinued making them. SONY also makes a good disc. These discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the Epson R200/R300/R320, and the surface area is printable right up to the hub! I have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as Verbatim continues to make a great disc\n",
    "\nThese Verbatims are terrific.  As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually, you\u0027re safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim\u0027s are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I\u0027ve bought one every couple months and I\u0027m on my 3rd spindle now.\n\nThey have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned, dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200).  Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos.  Not one coaster so far, burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X, it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMR-E55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly).  So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) .  Over 134 discs so far, and they look great, play great, and are a great price for hub printable discs.   Highly recommended...I\u0027m ordering more!\n",
    "\nNotebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.  Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues.  B\n",

In order to do so, you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player.\n\nI bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an X-Rocker chair with built in speakers, and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible, too.

    "\nI am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats, etc. Very handy! The unit did all that it promised, but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation, but not recording or EQ.\n\nNeeded additions:\n1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??!? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky. Better to have \"radio buttons\" associated with the App window. To be fair, the Widget does have better station selection, but the button is labeled with a \u0027heart\u0027...\n2. No station \"scan\" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.\n3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multi-band EQ that works well, mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also, one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though, for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this:  AUDACITY.\n\nOddities\n1. When first installed, the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings, they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions. Re-installed software and it began working well.\n2. Initially did not seem to work well thru an external (powered) hub; now has no problems.

    "\nI have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new iPod.  All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course!  And man- they still have it.  These aren\u0027t the greatest phones I\u0027ve ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice, full- the bass doesn\u0027t thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it\u0027s smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I\u0027ve ever owned!  My bottom line- anyone who doesn\u0027t grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I\u0027ve used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)\n\nI believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.\n\nWhat do you REALLY get for a \"high end\" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don\u0027t know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!\n\nWhat does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:\n---\n\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"\n\n---\nA digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn\u0027t degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\n\nOverall, I\u0027m very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)\n\n(P.S. for first time users, don\u0027t forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you\u0027ll never need them again.\n",

    "\nI purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \n\nMy laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I\u0027ll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don\u0027t really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it\u0027s really hot in the room, or if I\u0027m running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \n\nOverall, I\u0027d say I\u0027m very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) \n",
    "\nThe Logitech MX 400 mouse in my opinion was a good buy.  It is very reliable, accurate, scrolls smooth, and is precise and responsive on every surface I have used it on.  It is also light weight and comfortable, making it the purfect mouse for the price\n",
    "\nI bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They\u0027ve both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn\u0027t affected by it so I don\u0027t consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it \"should,\" but likewise, it\u0027s something to be expected with this much use and hasn\u0027t affected comfort.\n\nThe cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I\u0027m used to, which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.\n\nI\u0027ve compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ-50\u0027s (which I own) and a library\u0027s Koss UR-10\u0027s or 15\u0027s (can\u0027t remember which).  Though the QZ-50\u0027s do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20\u0027s are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won\u0027t eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50\u0027s\n",

The buttons on both of these Logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless.  This was not so on the MS 6000.\n\nIf you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook, the Logitech V450 is it.  My hands are fairly large, and for the $15 more than the v200, it is definitely worth it as I spend a lot of time on computers\n",

There\u0027s just no other easy way I\u0027ve found to keep track of all my receipts.  \n\nEven with some of the negativity about the accuracy on the receipt recognition, I still wanted to try this out for myself.\n\nI noticed the following will increase the accuracy of the receipt scanning:\n\n1) Scan your receipt ASAP once you have it.  Receipts are pretty cheap in quality and will fade over time.  Also for that matter, you risk the chance of loosing the receipt the longer you don\u0027t scan it in.  \u003d)\n\n2) Ink quality on the receipt matters.\nIt does the best job when the dots of the letters/number are together and dark.\n\n3)wording on the receipt.\ne.g. the receipt can say visa/mc then scanner will pick it as visa.\n\nBusiness card scans have been excellent for me.  Be sure to upgrade your sw to the lastest version.  Mine is 2.55 at the time of writing\n",

    "\nI live in Manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception. I use it hooked up to an HP 3200 lcd tv with built-in tuner. It took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception. The cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light. I have it resting atop my center channel speaker. $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football\n",
    "\nThis is very comfortable and works very well.  It\u0027s heavy enough that it doesn\u0027t move around or push the keyboard, as some of the other types of wrist rests that I\u0027ve used have done.  Yet it\u0027s cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support. \n",
    "\nI type medical reports for a living, up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week. Without the wrist rest, my wrists would not be able to hold up. The wrist rest is the perfect size. It stays in place on the desk. The gel continues to be supportive, even after a year of working on it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell. I can\u0027t smell it while typing, only when I pick it up for cleaning. I wish there was the option for half stars - I\u0027d give this 4-1/2 stars\n",

    "\nThis Uniden phone/answering system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago.  Here\u0027s a list of the other things about this phone that I like most:\n1.  The corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off.  This, along with price, was the main reason I bought this phone system.  This feature is unusual for a cordless phone system.\n2.  The controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you don\u0027t have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording.\n3.  Also, the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.\n4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week, sometimes more.\n5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.\n\nHowever, there is something about this phone system that I don\u0027t like.\n--The cordless handset has a pretty limited range.  I had to locate the base unit in a central location in my 2,300 square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms.\n\nBut overall I think the phone is a good buy, if you can live with the distance restrictions of the cordless handset\n",
    "\nVery effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone I have. Sound is ok for what it does. However, in a moving vehicle, it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noise-cancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise-cancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music, the intruding noise is over. Otherwise, no complains\n",
    "\nI was debating over the PictureMate, Kodak Printer Dock 3, Sony DDP-FP50, and the HP Photosmart 475. I made the choice of the HP and I LOVE IT! The prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints. I use the HP 4x6 boarderless Premium Plus photo paper with the HP Ink and the prints are just wonderful. Forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all. (...) The HP produces bright, vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime. The PictureMate is also alot larger than the HP 475. The 1.5GB hard drive is a plus as well. HP said that the remote is not included but they lied, they come with the remote and battery. Overall, this printer is the best I have own\n",
    "\nThese DVDs are absolutely top quality, and you really need to use bad DVDs to know how bad they can get.  I ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far.  Not a single coaster, and Nero data verification (I always do that for DVDs) has not brought up any errors ever.  BTW, the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files.  The burner is the DVD multi drive on my Dell Inspiron Laptop (1505).\n\nHowever, I should mention (to those who haven\u0027t bought this product) why they are called Shiny Silver.  You know that print on the top of DVDs with lines and that matte finish?  Well, there\u0027s no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I\u0027m talking about- No special surface; however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.  Huge cost cutting here I guess, but definitely not in the quality department.  I will buy again\n",
    "\nI burn a ton of DVDs and have used almost every brand out there.  Many have errors, even the top brand names like Memorex...etc.\n\nI have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting.  \n\nI\u0027ve switched all DVD media purchases to Verbatim.  They are by far, the best of them all.  Would recommend to everyone\n",
    "\nFirst off, these puppies sound good! However, there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know:\n\nThe sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn\u0027t permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \ni didn\u0027t give it five stars.\n\nAlso, the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) \u0026 RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn\u0027t realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.\n\nRiding while using them can be dangerous, since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. \n\nBang for the buck, ( I paid $69.99 on amazon), I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados.\n",
    "\nI purchase two of these phones to add to our base unit. Very easy set up. Quality product\n",
    "\nI had slight confusion whether to choose the sony 64 MB memory stick, which is nearly the same price or this one, which has twice the memory capacity of the previous one. I choose this one for the better deal and to add to my surprise J\u0026amp;R Electronics shipped it so quickly(You guys Rock!!!). This one comes par with sony memory media in every field. So why choose the one with lesser memory capacity. Choose this one and feed your camera with some memory space\n",
    "\nDelivered on time, no problems setting it up (just followed the instructions to format it because I didn\u0027t want the default format it comes with, which is less safe). It\u0027s been running fine ever since I bought it. I can\u0027t comment on the speed of access because, since I leave it backing up over night, I don\u0027t really care. It\u0027s all done in the morning anyway, so I don\u0027t really need anything faster\n",
    "\nI like this unit. It is hooked up to an S-Video in from my Digital Cable Box, and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV. Picture quality is very good; I\u0027m very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P, but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box, but then I\u0027ve not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program, deleted it, and then recorded again, it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy, anyhow. \nAll told, I\u0027d recommend this DVD recorder without hesitation\n",
    "\nI don\u0027t normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can\u0027t go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn\u0027t wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer\u0027s codes which they list in a handy guide.  If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won\u0027t be disappointed\n",
    "\nI bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk...I WAS TOTALLY WRONG!!! These are great, they give the bass right where you want it. Sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much. Watch out these come on sale instores for around $8.00 sometimes. That\u0027s where i got my 1st pair\n",
    "\nThe sound range and clarity is quite good, they are comfortable. My only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes, I\u0027d like to use it with my computer not a MP3 attached to my belt\n",
    "\nI got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple\u0027s part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It\u0027s smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.\n\nIt holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it\u0027s still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother\u0027s mp3 player, needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it\u0027s job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.\n\nAnother huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod \"family\" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I\u0027ve actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that\u0027s how much I love it!\n\nFor having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it\u0027s amazing!    \n",
    "\nI haven\u0027t written any reviews for Amazon before, but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball, I had to respond.  I\u0027ve been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90\u0027s when Kensington first came out with the \"Turbo Mouse\".  It was great then, and now it\u0027s better.  This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don\u0027t understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it\u0027s worth that.  It\u0027s a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.  If you need (or want) a high performance trackball that you\u0027ll be able to use with many computers to come, get this one\n",
    "\nThese speakers are awesome for the price.  They charge your ipod even when the unit is off.  The sound quality is great for around 50 bucks.  I bought these for traveling and they are small enough to fit in a suitcase without taking up too much room.  They also stack so they don\u0027t take up much counter space.  I can\u0027t say enough about the sound quality.  They are great\n",
    "\nI work for a small sized consulting engineer\u0027s firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text (magazine articles, old projects, letters from the client, books, etc).\n\nWe got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner ( still working ) and we have been impressed with its speed, small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality PDF files.\n\nA couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them.\n\nPROS :\n- incredibly easy to use ( you don\u0027t need to teach anybody )\n- fast for PDF scanning\n- great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled )\n- very small, perfect for a desk\n- good construction quality, no one of our 4 scanners ever broke\n\nCONS :\n- quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams, double-feeding that some time occurs.\n- not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ).\n\nI strongly suggest it for small-medium sized businesses to scan documents.\n\nIf you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better. \n\n",

    "\nThese are some great headphones with a few minor flaws:\n\nPros:\n1. Great sound quality\n2. Very comfortable\n3. Light\n4. Worry-free charging\n\nCons:\n1. Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy, could require pressing the tune-in button several times\n2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast\n3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)\n\nMy experience: I\u0027ve had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it\u0027s not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \n\nRegardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep. \n",
    "\nI have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd\u0027s.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \n\nFirst off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn\u0027t 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \n \nWhat brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \n\nOnce I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \n\nSince I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \n\nMy test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren\u0027t drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \n\nAll in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\n\nGood:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\n\nBad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\n\nFor their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer\n",
    "\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nJust a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy \u0027toys\u0027 before exploring what it is that they\u0027re buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\n\na- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software\u0027s auto-boot.\n\nb- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I\u0027m guessing that those company\u0027s that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the \u0027Uninstaller\u0027 on their site.\n\nc- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim \u0026 Memorex.\n\nd- For those who want portable software but don\u0027t want U3 or don\u0027t have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\n\ne- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics \u0027toys\u0027 available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don\u0027t meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\n\ng- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent \u0027roll-back\u0027 feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G\u0027s pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn\u0027t be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3\u0027s, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won\u0027t cut it because XP ain\u0027t as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software \u0027toys\u0027 that run under 2K, and the \u0027admin\u0027 can prevent you from loading a lot of software \u0027toys\u0027.\n\nh- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you\u0027ll have better luck getting what you want, and you won\u0027t look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\n\ni- When you truly understand the product, you\u0027ll be able to write TRULY useful reviews, and that what all readers want, useful information.\n\nTo one and all, may your \u0027toys\u0027 keep you happy\n",

    "\nI purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house. To start, I bought only one additional phone. I\u0027ll buy the rest later. So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that I have found very useful. Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.\n\nYou can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the \"Living Rm\" rather than phone #3, etc.\n\nIf you have caller ID, you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn\u0027t transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. \n\nAlso, on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own, the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say \"home\", etc. On this phone, the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. \n\nI think the phone is great, I just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature.\n\n",

    "\nI recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \n\nThe E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \n\nI am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \n\nI also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\n\nMy biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi\u0027s 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \n\nI bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded\n",

IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \u0026quot;over-the-head\u0026quot; headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can\u0027t beat that price\n",

I don\u0027t really like the band to go around the back of my head, causing my ears to support the headphones. I like the ones that go over the top of your head.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY.\n\nI have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter. These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes (PSP also) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord.\n\nFEATURES.\n\nCoolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls! About 3X feet away\n",

I\u0027ve not had any problems with interference, background hiss or anything of that nature.\n\nBattery life has been excellent.  I have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they\u0027ll last, but I use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they haven\u0027t failed me yet.\n\nThe only reason I would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use.  I\u0027m not really a big fan of this \"sport\" style of headphone, and probably wouldn\u0027t have tried these if I hadn\u0027t gotten them on clearance.  But, I found that after experimenting a little I was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable, even wearing them the better part of a workday\n",

    "\nFirst off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n\nInstallation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\n\nOne big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn\u0027t true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic\u0027s claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn\u0027t sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it\u0027s going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\n\nNow for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven\u0027t purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I\u0027m comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn\u0027t worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It\u0027s not bad, but it\u0027s going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\n\nAs with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer\u0027s website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\n\nAll in all, I\u0027m very impressed so far, and I\u0027m really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can\u0027t complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\n",
    "\nI\u0027m using this AP, along with a Netgear 802.11g PC Card to test streaming live/recorded TV to other parts of my house.  Seems like a capable product even if I didn\u0027t use the 108Mbps feature.\n\nHowever, be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it, configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network\u0027s DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.\n\nI noticed that there is are hordes of wireless APs around my house, I guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well.  However, this D-Link AP is able to function correctly abeit all the other APs around (2 using the same channel as mine I\u0027ve found).\n\n\nOverall, recommended if you want a good AP.  Just be sure to update the firmware\n",
    "\nThe sound quality is pretty darn good, except that if you pace around while talking/listening, there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite, and, if you stand still they go away.  I\u0027ve had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around, and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking - at least this phone doesn\u0027t do that.  \n\nMy 900 MHz DSS Uniden didn\u0027t have these sounds (while pacing or otherwise), and still had greater range.  I don\u0027t know why the new technology can\u0027t measure up.  Still though, this is the best 5.8 I\u0027ve tried.  (Yet I\u0027d rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore.  All of today\u0027s 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)\n\nAnother annoying thing is that you can\u0027t recharge the phone with the belt clip attached, so the clip goes on and off (and on and off).  (Many (cell) phones have a charger that allows this.)\n\nThe plastic is a bit cheap.  Don\u0027t drop this phone.  My friend has one and it hasn\u0027t worked since it was dropped.\n\n(I haven\u0027t tried the bluetooth yet, and have yet to see how good the battery life is.\n",
    "\nI got this base and added 6 TCX805 handsets to it.  The whole setup works great.  I got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone.  That features works well, there\u0027s a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that\u0027s trivial.  I will say this, you need to keep your cell phone within about 20\u0027 of this base.  I just take mine off, turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.\n\nSo if you want the cell dialing feature and like the more traditional upright handset, get this base and expand it with other handsets. \n",

    "\nResearched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32\" LCD.   Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   \nI mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn\u0027t be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  \nI\u0027ve also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42\" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There\u0027s also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  \nThe only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can\u0027t use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna.  \n",
    "\nI had a Zen Vision:M but I returned it because I decided I didn\u0027t need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player, so I decided to go with the Zen V since it\u0027s interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M\u0027s(which I liked).\n\nThe first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn\u0027t that impressed, but it\u0027s really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.\n\nThe music is organized your standard Artist-Album-Song interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still, it\u0027s as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hit-or-miss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.\n\n The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard, although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  \n\nThe player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also, if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer, album art will not be attached to the music tracks.\n\nIf you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bit-rate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player, half as much as advertised.  \n\nSummary:\n\nPros:\nExcellent physical design\nEasy to use interface\nGood navigation\nGreat sound quality\n\nCons:\nOn-the-go playlist creation is flawed\nAlbum art support hit-or-miss\nSlow transfer speeds from WMP11\nAccesories rarely available in brick-and-mortar stores\n\nUltimately, I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it\u0027s vastly superior physical design. \n\n\n\n",
    "\nI have had these speakers for over a month and I love them they sound awesome. They were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described\n",
    "\nI read the other reviews for these speakers so I had very high expectations. I can only say WOW! The premium price (compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems) is absolutely justified\n",
    "\nFor reference, I\u0027ve owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\n\nI initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1\u0027s because of the fantastic reviews they\u0027ve gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend\u0027s ProMedia 4.1\u0027s (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\n\nI tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500\u0027s which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\n\nSo... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021\u0027s which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they\u0027re probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\n\nThe sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\n\nSubwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It\u0027s very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn\u0027t shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn\u0027t have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don\u0027t sound right to me.\n\nPROs:\n* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\n* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\n* Power button on control pod\n* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they\u0027re on, not while they off. 100% silent.\n\nCONs:\n* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren\u0027t always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\n* Remote is a bit useless\n* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\n* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\n\nAnd finally, don\u0027t be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn\u0027t matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn\u0027t pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve owned these Altec\u0027s for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!\n\nSOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I\u0027m very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I\u0027m confident that this is the most crisp sound you\u0027ll find in any speaker\n\nVOLUME --- these suckers can get LOUD - just take my word for it\n\nCOMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\n\nCONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer\u0027s controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\n\nSIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy\n\nPRICE --- believe me - it\u0027s a bargain at under $200!!!\n\nOverall, I give my full recommendation here -- you\u0027ll love these speakers\n",
    "\nMy sound improvement wasn\u0027t as dramatic as many people describe, likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers, but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3\u0027s, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I\u0027m not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\n",
    "\nI wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $60.  I kept thinking, what could be so special about it.  Well, I don\u0027t know where to begin.  I like it so much, I\u0027m getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I\u0027d never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn\u0027t care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That\u0027s not why I got it, although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming, I really didn\u0027t notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.\n\nMy only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks \"homemade\".\n\nI would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a PC\n",
    "\nI got the Razor Diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it\u0027s performance.  For gaming it\u0027s great, but I do not recommended it for everyday mousing around. \n\nThe resolution on the Diamondback was the selling point for me, and if that\u0027s something your interested in you will NOT be disappointed.  It\u0027s really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it\u0027s design, but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked!  Oh, it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.\n\nDesign problems that I have noticed... Buttons squeak, button placement is not optimal, it\u0027s kinda small for people with big hands, programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement. If you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse, highly recommended\n",
    "\nI decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the \"g\" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.  Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So, I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet, over the last 5 hours.\n\nThe reason I took away one star is the fact on the Wireless Network Monitor V2.1 there seems to be a flaw.  When I connect to the network and internet the monitor says it is hooked to the network but unable to find the internet.  Obvious by my submission of this review, the internet can be found and used.\n\nAll in all a good product that functions just fine in my A45-S121 Toshiba laptop.\n\nPhil (Mesa, AZ\n",

    "\nI recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \n",

    "\nI bought this package purely for the keyboard. I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together, however.\n\nThe keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I\u0027ve ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven\u0027t gotten used to but it\u0027s fine.\n\nI have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I\u0027ve experienced no problems here, it\u0027s spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven\u0027t use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.\n\nI do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had built-in bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don\u0027t use the mouse very much, but the times I do use it I experience no problems.\n\nBoth the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.\n\nThe battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.\n\nOthers complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens, but I haven\u0027t had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is, and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.\n\nI highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse, or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way, you cannot go wrong with this package, it is extremely excellent\n",

    "\nBottom line up front:\n\nWorks very well, very low price, works much better with the \nincluded drivers than with the generic windows xp driver\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI bought this so I could use my new Treo 700w with my non-bluetooth-enabled laptop.  The price was my main motivation in buying it.\n\nInitially I just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay, however it didn\u0027t always work and i\u0027d have to unplug/replug for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other.\n\nAfter getting tired of that, I decided to install the drivers that ship with the product.  I\u0027ve had a much better experience since i did that.  I was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price, but it\u0027s actually quite good and gives you a TON of options that the standard XP driver does not provide.\n\nIf you use a this with a laptop and you dock/undock it, you\u0027ll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to docking/undocking.  Otherwise, you\u0027ll probably end up having to unplug/replug it\n",

    "\nI purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from, the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you\u0027ll know when they\u0027re calling without picking up the handset.\n\nTalking caller ID is great too. No more rushing to find the phone only to discover it\u0027s a sales pitch or a call that could wait.\n\nI set this phone up on a voice over IP cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear. \n\nThe phone is running next to an 802.11b/g wireless computer network and has NO interference at all. \n\nOne suggestion to make the batteries last longer: Do NOT leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time. This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays \"recharge\" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You\u0027ll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so\n",
    "\nI was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when I ran across these on a website. I was a little hesitant at first because I don\u0027t think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don\u0027t let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.\n\nI started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn\u0027t believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumps!\n\nIf you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you. If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector, these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these, I would have paid much more than I actually did\n",
    "\nThis is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don\u0027t think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\n\nOn the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I\u0027ve ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB\u0027s ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n\u0027 bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\n\nIt should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB\u0027s a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \n\nIn terms of build, the EB\u0027s superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM\u0027s (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB\u0027s don\u0027t extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB\u0027s.\n\nOh, and some people think that the EB\u0027s look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB\u0027s stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\n\nLike all of the UE IEM\u0027s in this series, the EB\u0027s are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM\u0027s, cord tangling.\n\nIt\u0027s unlikely that the EB\u0027s will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB\u0027s are well-designed and definitely fun\n",

    "\nThis is the 2nd Gamepad I\u0027ve owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4-button + D-Pad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system, plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted, etc.\n\nI love this controller.  I\u0027ve had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I\u0027ve only used it in NFS games (I have them all).\n\nThe WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.\n\nThe rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFS-MW is very slight but that\u0027s not the controllers fault, it\u0027s a matter of programming by EA Games.\n\nI like the weight of the controller.  It\u0027s not feather light, so with that motor and battery weight added, it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it - canadian dollars).  I didn\u0027t like how my gravis gamepad as so light, so this is a step up.\n\nThe analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for non-slip action.  I am used to the D-Pad, so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don\u0027t have time during a race to press a button before switching.\n\nIt works as well as my old gamepad, but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA, you\u0027ll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt\u0027s not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI\u0027m very satisfied overall and I knew I may have to get used to the way it feels when I hold this controller since changing from the old SNES style Gravis Gamepad.\n\n4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold\n",

    "\nI work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words, I don\u0027t talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don\u0027t use speaker phone features. Let\u0027s just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn\u0027t care less about.\n\nThis phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\n\nThe screen is attractive. A big step up from back-lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.\n\nI like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute, adjust volume, and page through your caller history.\n\nThe belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.\n\nI know many 5.8 GHz phones don\u0027t mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don\u0027t know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing\u0027s for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\n\nOne other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it\u0027s nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin\u0027 and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.\n\nFinally, I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone\u0027s screen displays the time.\n\nSo far I\u0027ve found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I\u0027ve owned\n",

Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!).

    "\nWith so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market, it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I\u0027m not an Apple-white drone).  The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.

Then I got my hands on some of Canon\u0027s Photo Paper Pro, and my pictures were magically crystal clear.  The difference is amazing.  I never would\u0027ve thought paper would make this much difference.  I\u0027ve since bought Canon\u0027s 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don\u0027t care much about the quality of the output, while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame\n",

    "\nThose people giving these speakers low reviews because they don\u0027t have enough bass are idiots.  I don\u0027t know what people expect of these little speakers, but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do.  These are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels; from Paris to camping in Northern California.  I cannot imagine going everywhere without them.  They are not  equivalent to a $10k stereo system, but they are not meant to be.  All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers.  Do not listen to the other reviews, these speakers will make a decent stereo of your MP3 player.  Enjoy them anywhere\n",
    "\nI have used VoSKY Skype Call Center (USB07051C-01) for about a year now as my only home Skype In phone (paying $3.16 a month) after getting rid of Verizon (for which I was paying $50.00 a month).\n\nPROS\nIt works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone.\nEasy to set up.\n\nCONS\nOnce in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the Vosky software and start again.\nYou need a computer.\n\nIn summary good value for money and the best way to use Skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like Skype Wi-Fi phones Netgear and Belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out; or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router\n",
    "\nAlthough I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever, I will try to address the issue at hand, and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.\n\nAs far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn\u0027t give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can\u0027t seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.\n\nSo despite the downfalls that I mentioned above, there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.  I simply love it, I just wish those other issues never happened\n",

    "\nI\u0027m a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub-woofer) I decided for this not-as-portable model.\nWell, these are perfect to keep on your desktop (though the ideal placement of any sub-woofer is on the floor close to a corner), as it has a small sized sub-woofer all controls in one the speakers.\n\nThese speakers sound really nice, slightly superior sound to Creative\u0027s corresponding model (SBS 350) but with less output power (Creative\u0027s SBS 350 sub-woofer is larger and more powerful)\n\nPros:\n\n- Headphone jack and POWER button in the left speaker\n- No \"wired remote\" (which adds more clutter to your desktop)\n- Nice design for the price\n- Even cheaper than Creative\u0027s SBS 350\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Small sub-woofer\n- No \"wired remote\" which means you have to keep one of the speakers close.\n- No bass control (which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control\n",

I bought it because, while my Dell laptop backpack is well padded, I wanted to make sure that my Quest 2 GPS was protected \"just in case\". This case fits perfectly, literally like a glove. When I got it, I was sceptical; it looked to small, but I was wrong; the dimensions are perfect. And there is more than enough padding to protect the GPS from harm, yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket, which I sometimes have to (late day meetings where I leave my backpack at work). All in all, it\u0027s another great product from Garmin\n",
    "\nI have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years. It keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn. The barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt.

They are a little noisy, but the horses don\u0027t care\n",
    "\nI purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount.  I don\u0027t know what the \"feet\" of the base is made of, but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F-250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it\u0027ll stay there.  Occasionally, on long or \"bouncy\" trips, it\u0027ll creep out of position a couple inches and I\u0027ll have to move it back.  I\u0027ve seen some comments complaining of that - but I don\u0027t see it as a problem since common sense says it won\u0027t stay perfectly still since it isn\u0027t bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.\n\nMy wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I don\u0027t recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion\n",
    "\nI got the dash mount because a friend recommended it.  I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also, there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to \"mold\" to fit the surface of the dash.  However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.  Anyway, it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when I stop, thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber\n",
    "\nThis is my first HOTAS, but I did a good bit of research.  It is very easy to set up, and the SST Programming is very helpful setting the shift key.

    "\nWe bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming \u0026 marching.  This is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice.  This is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades.  The drum is a bit heavy,large, cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is LOUD.  The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set.  If you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans, spoil him/her with this first-class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood\n",

Lets be real, this stuff SHOULD be plug and play and IT WAS. It came right up and worked and has worked for the past three months flawlessly. I have decent range downstairs, it works with the Macs and the PCs and doesnt seem to care a whit.

When the paper ran out I looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive - on the order of 40 cents per page.  Since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a letter-sized sheet of paper, that comes to about 20 cents per print, not counting the cost of ink.  Finally I stumbled upon this paper - Epson S041727 - and the price per print was around 12 cents, which rivals the cheapest Internet photo printing services I\u0027ve found.\n\nIf you print a lot of 4x6 pictures, this is a great value for a great product\n",

    "\nLet\u0027s just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD\u0027s, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn\u0027t need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I\u0027m sure 1000 songs will hold me. \n\nI looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.\n\nThe case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3.

    "\nI had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. \nI got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! \nI really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. \nI also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. \nPeople are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!\nI think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!\n",

The files are copied over to the device quickly, and easily.\n\nThe 2 Gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive.  \n \nScanDisk even includes a \"Synch\" software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data.

Considering the price of it i just couldn\u0027t see it holding up for what i wanted to do. to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations. For recording vocals this mic is amazing. a real professional sound for a extremely low price. i definitely recommend this mic to anyone out there looking for an in expensive way to make professional sounding material\n",
    "\nI have some decent mics in my cabinet, as well as a nice preamp, A/D converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup.  I wasn\u0027t expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.  Way to go, Samson\n",

    "\nThe 6500B was the last one I tried of three.  I\u0027ve had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a two-line phone that wasn\u0027t 2.4Ghz.\n\nThe first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn\u0027t know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \n\nNext I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It\u0027s a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it\u0027s simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it\u0027s answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn\u0027t have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We\u0027re so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it\u0027s not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\n\nThe Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic\u0027s phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn\u0027t work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\n\nThe 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It\u0027s much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7.  Also, can\u0027t name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number\n",

    "\nThis isn\u0027t my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don\u0027t underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you\u0027ll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you\u0027ve got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don\u0027t have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can\u0027t tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.\n\nAn unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won\u0027t have a heart-attack. Its doesn\u0027t hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you\u0027ll want more than this player anyway. \n\nThe best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3\u0027s and wma. It won\u0027t play AAC but if most of your music is this format you\u0027ll better off with an ipod.\n\nThis would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. \n\nI\u0027m giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle\n",
    "\nI decided to purchase this item because I needed to get SD memory for my g/friends digital camera, so I chose this one because of the price and the brand. SanDisk is known for their memory.

    "\nHow many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  \n\nThe SanDisk SDSDB-128-A10 Secure Digital 128MB, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.\n\nI truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs\n",
    "\nIf you buy this service plan, print out the contract (found at the top of this page) and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n\nSome notes on the contract:\n1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I\u0027m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\u0027s warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn\u0027t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don\u0027t cover accidents and they don\u0027t cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN\u0027T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don\u0027t hold me liable since I don\u0027t have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n\nAssuming they aren\u0027t jerks with their discretion and aren\u0027t too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn\u0027t get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

    "\nI have had mine for a week. I had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years, which was misplaced. I bought the navigation kit at the same time I ordered a 60 CS. It makes what I bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies. I had no problems loading software and maps, upload or download from/to my gps.\n\nI am impressed by the softwares ability to \"recalculate\" in navigation mode. If I ignore the suggested route, it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where I am.\n\nI am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc. are concerned but I am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained. I have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example (to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane), and knowledge of one-way streets etc.\n\nThe real test is yet to come to negotiate San Francisco\u0027s endless no left turns, one way streets, construction and limited freeway on ramps!!\n",

For example, I have an issue where I cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the USB receiver after a system start-up, however I am able to find those menus in the software if I remove and reinsert the receiver.\nBut as I said before, superb mouse function and tracking...this thing works on upholstery, leather, my jeans, and thick carpet!!\n",
    "\nThe V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn\u0027t get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn\u0027t weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn\u0027t fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don\u0027t like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn\u0027t a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\n",
    "\nWhen I purchased this product I was a little sceptical, however, once I unpacked it and started using it, it was so absolutely easy to use, and the pictures have such a fine quality, and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection.  So, I see it as a win/win product.  The only draw back is the weight and size. I just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel\n",
    "\nFirst and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can\u0027t comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.\n\nThat being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\nSo why four stars?  Well, for a few reasons:\n\n--Only available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I\u0027d have liked to match it.\n\n--No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn\u0027t disconnect so easily from the Nano that I\u0027d fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.\n\nFor this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn\u0027t the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.\n\n--NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano!  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only!\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners\u0027 fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\n\nAll in all, I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for\n",

    "\nThe Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they\u0027ll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I\u0027ve been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I\u0027ve always been satisfied with merely \"decent\" audio.  Until now.\n\nI\u0027d previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that\u0027s now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it\u0027s time to rip everything into lossless format.\n\nI cannot recommend these headphones more highly - they are simply extraordinary.  When your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality, though, life\u0027s going to get a lot more expensive, as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation.\n\nStill, this is a bloody miracle.  My ears have finally been opened.  Wow\n",
    "\nHaving been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\n\nEach time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600\u0027s, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP\u0027s. The difference in sound going \u0027lower\u0027 down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \n\nWhether you use Sennheiser\u0027s merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600\u0027s ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600\u0027s give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\n\nThe reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70\u0027s all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called \u0027\u0027Economy Class Beatles\u0027\u0027 George Harrison\u0027s and Ringo Starr\u0027s albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600\u0027s reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD\u0027s still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more \u0027round\u0027 in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600\u0027s make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600\u0027s are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to \u0027\u0027Take IT Away\u0027\u0027 from 1982\u0027s Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to \u0027silence\u0027 a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \n\nIt gets much worse than \u0027Take It Away\u0027 on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it\u0027s just too bad the rest of the album doesn\u0027t sound as good as that one song.\n\nWhen you listen to your CD\u0027s, vinyl, DVD\u0027s in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you\u0027ve spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney\u0027s JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600\u0027s, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \n\nCan I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I\u0027m trying to prove a point doesn\u0027t it.\n\nAlbums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600\u0027s. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\n\nIsao Tomita\u0027s The Firebird (1976)\nGeorge Harrison\u0027s eponymous album (1979)\nSteely Dan\u0027s Gaucho (1980)\nJoe Walsh\u0027s The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get (1973)\n10CC\u0027s The Original Soundtrack (1975)\nGodley \u0026 Creme\u0027s Consequences (1977)\nSupertramp\u0027s Crime of the Century (1974)\nXTC\u0027s Black Sea (1980)\nPeter Gabriel\u0027s 3rd album (1980)\nKate Bush\u0027s The Dreaming (1982)\nEarth Wind and Fire\u0027s All \u0027n\u0027 All (1977)\nLevel 42\u0027s The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)\nBilly Cobham\u0027s Spectrum (1972)\nFrank Zappa\u0027s One Size Fits All (1975)\nRingo Starr\u0027s Goodnight Vienna (1974)\n\nand a truly incredible sounding album from the 90\u0027s, Prince and The New Power Generation\u0027s \u0027\u0027Symbol\u0027\u0027 album from 1992.\n\nAlbums NOT HD-600 friendly:\nTodd Rundgren\u0027s Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)\nBlue Oyster Cult\u0027s Agents of Fortune (1976)\nPaul McCartney\u0027s Venus and Mars (1975 - and quite a few others)\nJohn Lennon\u0027s Imagine (1971 - and avoid 1970\u0027s Instant Karma like the plague, the piano track will hurt you . .  )\nYes\u0027s Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)\n\nand surprisingly enough, many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain\u0027t broken.  \n\n\nIf you have to save up for a pair, or do some heavy searching for HD-600\u0027s that are affordable, do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed, especially when I kept up with their pace.\n\n\n\n",
    "\nI just purchased one of these and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews that stated how difficult it was to load the information into the unit. I had no problem at all. In fact it was quite simple. I am truly amazed at how acurate and easy to use this unit is. For the price, you can\u0027t beat it\n",
    "\nI bought the Transcend 1 GByte card for my PDA. My Axim x51v immediately recognized it and is working flawless for the past few weeks. I am planning to get the 4GB model too which is currently retailing for $90 to $110 elsewhere.\n\nHar\n",
    "\nI was mislead with Amazon review which said it supports conversion to MP3 format with the software supplied, it does not. The help quite clearly states \"You cannot convert a file into an MP3 file\". It will convert to .wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to MP3.\n\nIf it had MP3 support (at least conversion on the PC from the Sony proprietary format which is .msv) I would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible. It you record in full quality mode (1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing. The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.\n\nBut it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion. Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space.\n\nBut I would buy one again, as it is very easy to use, small, and very high quality. I just hope Sony would listen to consumers and support MP3\n",

    "\nBefore I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website, \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was, I didn\u0027t like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\n\nIt was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It\u0027s very simple.\n\nI am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn\u0027t fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I\u0027m perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\n\nIf you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I\u0027m sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there\u0027s a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer\u0027s \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\n\nOverall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product\n",
    "\nThe HP12C has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years. I bought my first one when I was a consultant and it lasted until August 2006. It withstood all the travel and constant use well. I use it for simple and complex math; statistical analysis and financial analysis. It is much faster and simpler to operate than a PC. My new one has all the same great features. I highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis.\n",
    "\nI bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn\u0027t work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse. \nAnother nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control\n",
    "\nThis is a great printer.  I have used it several times and it makes great pictures.  I had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great.  Tried this on a regular printer and the print didn\u0027t look near as great.  A great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have.  You can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards.\n\nColors are great and vivid.  Also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop.  I have not tried printing to non Epson paper so I can\u0027t say how prints would look.  I know that Epson printers look the best printed on Epson paper. \n",

    "\nI love this keyboard. \nAfter searching through just about every keyboard available, I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I\u0027m so glad that I chose this one.\nIt is excellent! The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It\u0027s a great keyboard for gaming, office use, media or just ordinary, everyday use.\nThey keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool, but I don\u0027t use it much. It\u0027s better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though.\nI really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files, e-mail or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don\u0027t like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can\u0027t see any way to reasign it. However, it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard.\nAside from all of that, how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it.\nTo top it off, it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability\n",
    "\nI have been into MP3s since 1996 - I used winplay, and l3enc, and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere - Africa, Europe, My living room.  \n\nAfter about 70,000 hours of use and abuse, it finally died.  \n\nI needed a replacement, so I looked at iPod, and Zune, but why would I stray from Creative Labs?  Besides, it\u0027s better in every way - better screen than the ipod, better interface than the Zune, and a better battery than either one.\n\nWhen I plugged it into my computer, I was blown away.  XP found the player, and without any drivers or proprietary (think iTunes) software, I was able to drop my non-DRM ;) mp3 files right onto the generous space available.  I was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything, or ever being forced to reboot my PC.  I transferred a couple of movies and I\u0027m looking forward to my next flight\n",
    "\nThis is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  I bought it three weeks ago.  If I hadn\u0027t seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I\u0027ve had with it.  I\u0027m not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I\u0027m listening to music.  I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the MP3s, because I\u0027ve never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would\u0027ve added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would\u0027ve rated it a 5\n",
    "\nBought this DVD player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  It has many features and a good picture. You can\u0027t beat the large screen. I like the zoom feature especially. Another feature I like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you don\u0027t have a bulky protrusion when it\u0027s attached.The sound is not loud as others have said but I have yet to find a portable DVD player that has good sound.  You\u0027ll have to use external speakers or ear phones(included). Another thing I notice is that DVD-RW or DVD+/- R are not supported. They play but the menu system does not work. You have to access the file manually. That being said I cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than $299.  The shipping was fast and free.  There is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold \"as-is\" but the unit I got was brand new and not refurbished. So far so good.  I don\u0027t thonk you will be disappointed\n",

The Belkin Gold unit with RF/EMI suppression up to 75db cured all the rattle and hum problems with speakers, satellite signal, the \"dirty\" line into my modem, and a week later I haven\u0027t had to reboot my system once. Amazing!\n\nI had already had a great experience with a Belkin SurgeMaster on my Home Theater setup, so I went one level up with this \"Gold\" unit. One of the better investments I\u0027ve made lately. I paid $60 at the local Office Depot, the price Amazon is advertising is ridiculously low at $35. Belkin.com\u0027s price is about $70 so my advice is to buy this unit now before somebody at Amazon wakes up  and jacks the price.\n",
    "\nI bought this recorder to use as backup for real-time event video recording.  I have also used it concert settings.  The record quality is astounding, full range of dynamics, using both the stereo mini-plug input and the 1/4\" inputs.  It is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio.  First thing I did was to upgrade to a 4GB Compactflash card.  The provided card is too limited.\n\nBattery life is adequate for hour plus recordings, and connection and downloading to PC is a breeze.  The WAV files are really high quality.\n\nIt all works as advertised.  The only minor glitch I have had, is that when you first try to start a recording, it gives a \"media full\" message, even tho the media is empty.  Then you select record again and it records just fine.  I went several iterations with Tech Support, who were very friendly and helpful, but the problem has not been resolved.  I also suspect the 3rd part flash card may be contributing to this glitch.  I would buy this recorder again\n",

The Sony progressive scan and LG plasma now are like looking at real people no a screen , the HD stiff is simply the best , digital cable it good and the dvd\u0027s are quite near HD.  All in all I would highly reccomend this to anyone.  \n\nThe blue light is quite bright but i placed a piece of blue painters tape over it and it is no longer a problem.  the voltage meter light is adjustable and not an issue.

I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card.  CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)... Caused more artifacts on HD channels, so couldn\u0027t use the cable line filter.\n\nBottom line: Seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing @ Amazon\n",
    "\nActually 4 and a half stars...I borrowed one of these Logic3 amplified Ipod speaker systems for a weekend camping trip and was impressed with the sound and portability. I decided to buy one of my own after looked at several other makes and models all of which were more money. Plenty of connectivity along with base adapters to hold most Ipod models securely.

    "\nI was looking for something suitable to house my sansa, and this fit the bill better than most. The leather case is superb, looking sharp, snug and protective. I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven\u0027t figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances. This way, I suppose, it wouldn\u0027t be able to fall off\n",

I created the  design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper. The results  were outstanding for a do-it-yourself project. I followed the instructions  included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake. One thing that I  did find out - keep the transfers dry after they have been printed. One got  wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in  contact. This product also does a very good job in black and white, not  just in color. The shirts that I did, laundered according to the  instructions, came out of the wash lookin\u0027 good. I won\u0027t hesitate to use  this product again in the future.

    "\nWe purchased the YSP-1 in August as a companion to our Hitachi Ultravision wall-mounted television.  What a fabulous piece of audio equipment!\n\nWhen we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system, my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wall-mounted?  Doesn\u0027t take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment.  The other, on the salesroom floor.  In both set-ups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement.  So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer.  My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall, we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space). \n",

Yes, there are more complex set-ups, with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room, but if you just want the magic without the madness, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX is an incredible (and very affordable) solution that\u0027s quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes.\n\nOf course, there are other 3-speaker desktop systems by makers like Logitech, Cyber Acoustics, and Intec, but here\u0027s the difference: Klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer, while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers.  NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose, Harman Kardon, JBL, and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3-speaker sets both sound nasal and \"tinny\" on the high end, while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great, but are more expensive.  So, after a good look (and listen) around, I went with Klipsch.\n\nIn any case, this is an incredible sound set-up for your computer-based music player and should not be overlooked.  Enjoy\n",
    "\nThis splitter was set-up as part of a configuration that splits one line from the street into three and then into sixteen ports and a line to the cable modem for a fraternity house. I used this brand of splitters and a moterola amplifier all the way through, and the results were amazing. The picture quality is crystal clear, even when almost all of the ports are in use, and the internet is blazing fast. Compared to the set-up we used to have, with some cheap splitters and a radio shack amplifier, these pieces are WELL WORTH THE SMALL EXTRA COST\n",
    "\nThese cables are super with my new DVD player. There is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment. The picture is soo clear, and vivid. The cables themselves are really made well, they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt. If you get these Monster cables you won\u0027t be sorry\n",
    "\nI previously had a 2.1 sound system for my computer, that were pretty good a few years ago when I bought them.  When I decided to replace them with these I was rather happy with my choice.  The sound is extremely clear and crisp, whether it be music or games, and I am very pleased with them.  The only downside to them is how many extra cords there are behind my desk, but you have to expect that with a 5.1 sound system\n",
    "\nI am glad I bought this backpack. It exceeded all my expectations. I strongly recommend this one\n",
    "\nThese are really great. Super noise cancelling. Affordable. They cover my ears completely without problem. At first, the headset was a bit tight, so I stretched the top headband upwards a little to relax or slightly loosen it. No more problem, while still having a snug fit. These headphones also fold up very compact, have two plug adapters and a nice durable sack for storage.\n\nIf you buy these, just make sure they fit well for your ears. If so, these are great; if not, try another type. Like all things that touch the body, it is best to try at a local store, before you buy it. \n\nThis is the lowest price I have seen for this product.\n\n",
    "\nI am happy with my purchase.  I only bought it because I don\u0027t like the idea of going deaf listening to loud music through earphones.  I would not use this product to entertain at a party, but it serves my needs\n",
    "\nOn a recent trip, I was 23 hours in transit and couldn\u0027t have made it without this little device. It powered my movies and TV shows for at least 12 hours or so without a flicker. I was worried that the four AA batteries would make it heavy to carry but it didn\u0027t matter when the device was sitting on my tray table. Besides, it was comforting to know that AA batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world. By the way, I substituted the original batteries with Duracells on the advice of previous reviewers\n",
    "\nI bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it. I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time. Reading other people\u0027s reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great. The only complaint I have is the suction cups aren\u0027t that great. Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. \n\nOverall, I recommend this product. It is a little bulky, but if you\u0027re someone like me who cannot live without music, it\u0027s a great product to have if you aren\u0027t going to be able to charge your Ipod\n",
    "\nI have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control.  I experienced the same thing until I realized that I mistaken the up \u0026 down buttons with the + \u0026 - buttons.  The volume works just fine on my wife\u0027s old Sony receiver.  The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do.  As stated in others\u0027 reviews, you can\u0027t read the screen from a distance, thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.  However, it would be worse if the remote couldn\u0027t scroll through menus.\n\nIt is compatible with the latest video iPod.  I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers.  I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me.  I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again, I don\u0027t expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.  Since I have this little gadget for my wife, I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better.\n\nIn summary, this dock does a good job and the design is not bad.  The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote.  If you are looking for great sound quality, I haven\u0027t encountered any dock that is better than this one, so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock\n",
    "\nI\u0027m really happy with this purchase. I was worried that it would not work with Rhapsody (which is the media player I use the most), but it proved to work well with it. In fact, it works with all the media player I\u0027ve thrown at it, including Windows Media Player, MediaLife, RealPlayer, iTunes, Rhapsody, DivX Player, WinDVD, and PowerDVD. \n\nAll the buttons are functional (and I worship functionality - hence the 5 stars), although Firefox users have to deal with extra configuration steps to make the back and forward button work. No biggies, though, since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver, point to the intended buttons that you want to program, and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case, it\u0027s Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click \"Apply\" and you\u0027re good to go a-browsin\u0027!!\n\nBattery life so far is really good - it\u0027s been going on the same set of Duracell AA batteries since I got it 3 months ago, and still going strong. \n\nThe RF range is really good, although admittedly my room isn\u0027t big enough to really put its range to the test. Dorm-dweller users should be happy with the range, though. You could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie.\n\nThis mouse is also great looking; not cheap-plasticky but actually sharp and slick. It does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control, but as a mouse it\u0027s really sturdy and ergonomic. \n\nI can\u0027t comment on installation since it\u0027s been a while since I first used it, but I guess no impression is good impression - if it was troublesome I\u0027m sure I\u0027d remember.\n\nI\u0027d second the other reviewer\u0027s gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse, and this fantastic mouse doesn\u0027t come with a cordless keyboard... But it\u0027s a great buy, all in all\n",
    "\nIt would seem, even to a non-tech, that someone has switched your Uniden mobile/base tech. data around. Secondly, terms such as \u0026quot;standard\u0026quot; mean less than trustworthy when applied to sensitivity and selectivity.

    "\nUntil an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound, these were my favorite pair of earphones. They were comfortable (I often left them in when I went to sleep), affordable, lightweight, durable, and had good sound quality. I used them with my Sony CFD-V5 boombox, my Oritron OP5034 portable CD player, and my RCA RP2410 MP3-CD player. On all three, bass and detail was great, and there was no distortion at a higher volume. All in all, these earphones were a great value; the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound, which I got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones (it lent a bit of warmth to the music). I plan to buy another pair in the near future, and I highly recommend that you do so as well\n",
    "\nOrdering was fast and easy.  Could not detect any inferiority in the cartridges and will order them again\n",
    "\nI received it today, and it\u0027s a monster.  If you\u0027ve seen one in a store, it looks twice as big on your desk.  Until a few hours ago, I was running two 20\" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP, I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides, I didn\u0027t feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world, or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).\n\nTo my great relief, the monitor worked on the card right away, even showing me the POST and Windows start-up screen (it did for the 20\" displays, too).  But to my absolute delight, the card is actually running both the 30\" and a 20\" in 32-bit color.  The 20\" looks absurdly small next to the 30\", like I didn\u0027t water it enough or something.  The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved!  Maybe I\u0027m just sitting too close.\n\nThe only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20\" plug to fit it below the 30\".  I\u0027m not a gamer, so I can\u0027t say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20\" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse, Flash, Photoshop, etc., but no video editing or 3D stuff.\n\nThe screen had a slight warm cast that I didn\u0027t like.  Nvidia\u0027s control panel let me adjust it manually, and now my 30\" and 20\" look almost identical.  My biggest fear was of course dead pixels.  By the good grace of lucky ducks, this is the third panel I\u0027ve gotten from Apple with no dead pixels.  Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges.  It\u0027s not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it.\n\nIn any case, I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once, and it does a fine job at that.  I\u0027m using the 20\" for browsing and, alas, a few panels that STILL don\u0027t fit.  Apple, where\u0027s 3840 x 2400??  I strip one star cuz it\u0027s crazy expensive.\n",

    "\nI ordered v8 as soon as it was advertised by Garmin but they shipped v7 instead.  Six weeks later I got the v8 update dvd.  My wife and kids had to make due with v7 while in Madrid.  She was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence.  However, she noted that Madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways.  In the end, she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit re-calculate her route. \n",
    "\nIf you understand this product\u0027s limits before you buy it, you\u0027ll be happy.  It shows topographical contours, rivers and most streams for the entire United States.  In addition to that, it shows roads that were in existance 10-20 years ago.  These major roads are also named.\n\nThe limit is that newer roads don\u0027t show up.  It also doesn\u0027t support auto-routing, even if your GPS does.  Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package isn\u0027t suited for it.\n\nThe product support could be better.  Neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 CDs on your computer so you don\u0027t have to swap CDs when transitioning between zones.  The company\u0027s web site doesn\u0027t give a good explanation of what the software can and can\u0027t do.\n\nYou\u0027ll be disappointed if your expectations aren\u0027t grounded in reality.  Garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available\n",

I resisted spending the money on a new monitor for a long time, but now I\u0027m glad I made the switch to LCD. The color and clarity is wonderful. Most of all, I love having all this extra space on my desk. For the money, this is a great monitor\n",

I hooked it up, and to my surprise, it  wasn\u0027t any better than my old player as far as quality. Then I purchased  S-Video cables from Monster Video and now the colors are more vibrant, the  picture is in higher-res, and I can see every little detail on the screen.  The picture quality that these S-Video cables produce are surpassed only by  component video cables, which cost many times more the price. If you are  considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of  only one DVD, you can get better performance and picture quality\n",

    "\nI love sound systems. So when I got my new reciever (Sony STR-DE898/B) I hooked up the new speaker wires with the THX Certified Gold Plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference. I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire, I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I\u0027m ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn\u0027t on my old system. I like testing sound with: The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks), Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach), and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product\n",
    "\nThis is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen, the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I\u0027m so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn\u0027t do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case, no screen protectors out for it. I\u0027d love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune.\n",

    "\nI did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse.  I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable.  At home, I use a Wacom tablet.  Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington.  Wireless was key for portability.  I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn\u0027t want the USB adapter sticking out.\n\nI received it today, and I\u0027m on my first charge.  So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway).\n\n- I have large but skinny hands.  Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers.  Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size.\n\n- I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4).  Excellent Bluetooth connection.  Also very good response, very little delay.  Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position.  It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. \n\n- USB charger works well.  The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse.\n\n- As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge.  Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers.  Once I figured it out, not so hard. \n\nOverall, I don\u0027t seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me.  I haven\u0027t tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I\u0027m more or less in awe\n",
    "\nThis card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use.  \n\n512 MB is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 MB or less camera, assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time.  With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often, this card holds over 400 photos, and it will hold even more for those using a more email-friendly setting.  Do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you, but I\u0027ve had no problems with SanDisk products\n",
    "\nI have to admit, I\u0027m a GPS junkie.  I\u0027ve had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3 - the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving.\n\nI am greatly impressed with this unit.  It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.\n\nThe user interface is very easy to use.  I\u0027ve used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface.  I think Garmin\u0027s is better.\n\nOne highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI), but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  This allows you to identify, say, hotels along your route while you are driving and then, using the telephone info provided by the unit, to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive - \"let your fingers do the walking...\"\n\nIf you don\u0027t tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn\u0027t know which city to specify and I did a search for \"Eagle Rock Rec\" (I was too lazy to spell out \"Eagle Rock Recreation Center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn\u0027t know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\n\nThe advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all In-N-Out Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you\u0027ll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\n\nThe newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven\u0027t tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340\u0027s text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\n\nSince I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin\u0027s MapSource Topo mapping software, I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300-500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked!  So now I have the c340\u0027s excellent built-in maps and POIs for on-road trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for off-road adventures.\n\nOne thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit\u0027s WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.\n\nAlso, since this unit has a touch-screen, fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammonia-based product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog.  Instead, use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don\u0027t use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid.\n\nI give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it\n",
    "\nThis paper works excellent in the hp series printers. I have tryed many other makes of Photo paper and they just don\u0027t cut it. Some other makes don\u0027t dry in a timely manner, others have a dull finish them, some have a red tone. This HP Photo paper allows you to print store developed quality photos from your hp printer.

    "\nThere\u0027s no need to take anybody else\u0027s word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user\u0027s manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl\u003dDVPNS90V\u0026LOC\u003d3. I\u0027ve been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is \"no bass management,\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user\u0027s manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD\u0027s are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user\u0027s manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVD-Audio discs.\" Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A\u0027s that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVD-A\u0027s (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A\u0027s, and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it\u0027s bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. In short, you\u0027ll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user\u0027s manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features\n",
    "\n...what it has that the xr55 does not: HDMI, dual-amping of front mains now available during 5.1 playback, one extra set of component inputs, and all-channel stereo (called \"party mode\" on other receivers).  \n\nOtherwise the internal components are identical, so expect similar performance---in other words, outstanding SQ when matched with the right speakers, blows away all other receivers under five hundred bucks and most under a thousand.  \n\nSee my lengthy review of the xr55 for more details.  \n\nBoutique audio shops do not want you to know about this product, because it\u0027d put them out of business...they make much higher margins selling you receivers costing several times this Panasonic\u0027s prices, since their profits are usually a fixed percentage of the street price. \n",
    "\nThis is the second Brother HL-2070N printer i\"ve owned. The first died during a storm and I forgot about electrical surges. The only negative on this printer is a slight curling of the pages.

    "\nMuch cheaper than other Sony machine.  Works fine -- then again, I wasn\u0027t looking for anything fancy.  Don\u0027t have problems with the speakerphone or message recording as the others did.  I like the dual keypads\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve had my Epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent. I run exclusively on Linux (currently Gentoo) and the Linux support for this printer (using CUPS) is superb. All modes, resolutions, etc. are supported. I use this printer a lot for engineering work printing B-size (tabloid) drawings and it works great for that.\n\nLike just about every review states, this printer slurps ink like Homer Simpson slurps beer. Because I don\u0027t print many color photos this is not a problem for me--if I was doing that I\u0027d get the Niagara system other reviewers cite. I\u0027ve researched the Niagara system and  it looks like a good deal for heavy users. \n\nMy main complaint with this printer--and the reason why it only gets four stars--is the ease with which the heads clog up. This printer wants to be used constantly. If you let it sit for a day or two it\u0027s almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you\u0027ll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the front-panel control or, in more extreme cases, run the head-unclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to \u0027blow out\u0027 the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a sponge-sandpaper-like thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That\u0027s when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this \u0027trait\u0027 I would not recommend this printer for casual users.\n\nStill, for B-sized printing and high-quality photos, and considering how well supported it is under Linux, there\u0027s not much else better out there\n",
    "\nHaving owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen\u0027t have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I\u0027m giving 5 stars on the Epson 128\n",
    "\nI ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn\u0027t support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer\u0027s have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won\u0027t process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore\n",

    "\nEarlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don\u0027t understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.\nNote to the technosavy: I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites, so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also, the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out, so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this, you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.  \nNote 2: the factory referbished models come with a DVI cable, a 20-30 dollar value that many don\u0027t come with\n",

    "\nBREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.\n\nIs this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative.\n\nThis dock basically serves three purposes:\n- The traditional synch \u0026 charge function available since the early days.\n- It helps you get \"Line\" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.\n- The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends \u0026 family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the \"Apple iPod AV Cable\" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.\n\nIn summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV.  If you don\u0027t do it, it\u0027s just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box\n",

It does not support VCR+ or a TViO-style program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus.

Every on-screen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.\n\nThe commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn\u0027t quite granular enough, but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. \n\nMy only complaint: The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on right-hand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet, the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can\u0027t shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won\u0027t open if it\u0027s too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.\n\nAt the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I\u0027d say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting, only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk, the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The four-hour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flex-mode option I haven\u0027t tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.\n\nIt\u0027s too bad other vendors haven\u0027t adopted the -RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media, but it won\u0027t play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison, but this unit can play and record on them. \n\nWatching one show while another is recording (or the same show that\u0027s recording, but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained on-screen pretty well, but you should spend some time in the manual if you\u0027ve never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.\n\nOne interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using, the signal is sent through the s-video output.\n\nIt can\u0027t burn music CD\u0027s which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won\u0027t lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star\n",
    "\nI purchased the Monster Cable MP HTS 1000 without reading the reviews,(which I don\u0027t usually do) for the simple reason of where I purchased my hdtv, Samsung HLS-5687w they were trying to sell me but for a $150, which was too much.  I plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound.  I have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable.  That connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop.  After switching around the cables I had a picture again.  I can\u0027t really see an improvement in the picture quality (HD is beautiful) I bought the monster basically for the protection\n",
    "\nThe 50G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1GB operating system file address space. Only about  0.9GB of the SecureDigital flash cards (a little more on the HP 49G than on the HP 50G) are accessible. The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards. The HP 50G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate. The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49G red (or tomato) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate. The black HP 50G looks tastefully geared for serious users. They still have no display backlighting or a color display. The HP 50G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970\u0027s series of the HP hand held calculators\n",
    "\nThe convenience of this product is terrific.  Whenever I show people how it snaps in half, they\u0027re amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one.

    "\nI am going to strictly comment on the Linksys PAP2. A lot of the reviews on here have been for the Vonage service. The Linksys PAP2 is NOT THE Vonage service, but one of many adapters you can use. \n\nI am extreamly satisfied with my Linksys PAP2. It is small, light weight, and perfect for those who need to travel. The voice quality is excellent and people say I do not sound like I am talking over VOIP. There is no line noise, static, popping, etc. \n\nI am giving this product 4 stars. Why? Because there is only ONE ethernet port. If you have a router, just connect the PAP2 to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go. If you do not have a router, consider getting another Vonage phone adapter with built in 4-port router. There are several.\n",
    "\nI read the other reviews and don\u0027t understand where they are coming from UNLESS they are all by AT\u0026T or BELL employees.  I\u0027ve had Vonage for 3 years and have nothing but good things to say about it.  I have local numbers for Seattle, Salt Lake City, Boston and San Francisco so my friends can stay in touch. These numbers only cost me $4.99/each a month.  Customer service is excellent.  They stay right on the phone with you until everything works perfectly.  This is especially nice after they added 911 service\n",

    "\nInstallation on a normal home network setup is very easy. My setup was a little more complex due to voip router, and 2nd wireless router. Sling has instructions on their web site but I still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work. To work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. Once I worked this out everything is great. \n\nVideo quality is good in the house, haven\u0027t tried it from another location. I\u0027m running the Sling AV with Netgear Ethernet power adaptors to my router and then watching TV via wireless to my laptop. Now we can watch TV in any room of the house. My wife loves being able to watch the news in the morning while in the kitchen. She also loves being able to surf while having a show running in a small window on the side. \n\nControl of my Dish DVR is very good. We can manage any feature of our Satelite/DVR box. This will come in handy when we travel as we have our sons Seaseme Street shows on the DVR and now we can take those with us on the road. \n\nOverall, I\u0027m pleased with the Sling AV. It offers good performance at a great price point. Now Sling just needs to get the Mac version out so I can watch TV on my beautiful 15.4 inch Mac Book Pro\n",

    "\nI bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint.  I use it in Chicago.  A lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal, not true at all.  I think the longest I have ever waited was 20 seconds.  It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes, when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.\nOverall, this GPS works perfectly.  The auto-reroute is fantastic, it is very quick to recalculate my route if I miss a turn, and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn. You will not be disappointed with this purchase\n",
    "\nSoundwise the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s were everything that they were supposed to be.  The bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted.  The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection.  Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case.\n\nSomething to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound.  The wires themselves are long enough and there shouldn\u0027t be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room.  One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8\" plugs for hooking up the sound source.  If you want optical you\u0027re going to have to go elsewhere.\n\nPlease note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality.  If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money.  Same goes for music quality, if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding, not the speakers.  If you can\u0027t spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive.\n\nOverall these speakers are a great deal.  While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies.  For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good, however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system.  Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast, don\u0027t bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.  If you are more worried about loudness, do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers, you won\u0027t even notice the difference\n",

    "\nGreat for frequent air travel to pass the time. Minor complaints - instructions are sparse (had to get my son to show me how to use iTunes \u0026 load songs), but still haven\u0027t figured out how to arrange songs on the iPod. My problem\n",
    "\nThis backpack has been such a useful companion for me.  There are lots of space inside even for huge text books, and compartment is arranged just right to hold variety of stuff---CDs, DVDs, paperback books, pens, cell phones, water bottles, etc., etc.  There are numerous creative ways of storing stuff.  Indeed my whole life as a student can be inside at once.\n\nAs a notebook backpack, this would not provide the best protection.  Padding is fine, but depending on how much stuff you have a notebook inside could be squeezed a bit more than you desire.  Also, the clip to fix the cover flap onto the backpack almost is broken after a year of daily use for me.  I have had Dell 14\" and 15\" laptops with the backpack and fitting was just fine for securely hold it inside.  Wearing comfort is pretty good, and things are quite adjustable for your body.\n\nI would recommend this backpack if carrying more than a laptop, e.g., testbooks, is essential for you.\n\nP.S., I ended up using a warranty support to fix the buckle.  Targus\u0027s customer support is first rate---prompt, courteous, and reliable.  They actually replaced the backpack with a newer version of the same product.  Their service totally make them highly recommended\n",
    "\nI had to \u0027fix\u0027 this ipod holder with a bicycle hand grip to stop it from shaking my ipod. I have a decent car and the roads are just ok but this thing shakes and shakes. I also put one of those beer coolers around the base of the foam hand grip and its now rock solid. Oh yeah and it holds the ipod just right too. I also put some of those velcro dots on the bottom for a little more security from my cup holder\n",
    "\nI hadn\u0027t seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod).\nThe holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It\u0027s very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me.\n\nThe part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups.\n\nThe only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn\u0027t affect functionality so it doesn\u0027t make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn\u0027t hold iPods in their cases. So if you\u0027re like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.\n\nI like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you\u0027re willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.\nEdit: I bought it for $20, but now it\u0027s $15. One more good reason to get this one.\n\nI\u0027m not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this, so don\u0027t buy this for your 5G iPod unless you\u0027re already sure or can try it before you buy it\n",

She did want some extra compartments for organization. \n\nThis case has met all her needs, it is light weight, constructed of durable material, well organized. Her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease. She is satisfied with this purchase. We would recommend purchasing this case.\n\n",
    "\nI have owned many Sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now. The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory, you run out when you need it most. That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig. Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go. \n\nLook, when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (3-6 megapixels) per picture, which you should always do to get the best possible prints made, your camera will need a ton of storage space.  Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn\u0027t expected like a wildfire, a plane crash, a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens. You can always \"resize\" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space. Trust me, take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.\n\nYou never know. I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things. I have a helicopter crash, police car up a power poll, deer in downtown Oakland, house fire before the Fire Dept got there, tons of wild animals, any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park. If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!\n\nMatching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea. No problems ever!! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems. They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer. They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable. I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality. If you want quality buy SONY\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve used the iTrip by Belkin, the TunecastII by Belkin, and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough, though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.\n\nI think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you\u0027re taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI -- that\u0027s a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can\u0027t do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn\u0027t work).  Also, you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8, I don\u0027t think going higher would help because there\u0027s more congestion.  I like the single button because there\u0027s no confusion whether you\u0027re going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can\u0027t use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car, it does what it should and does a decent job of it\n",
    "\nWorks precisely as advertised.  None of the complaints in previous reviews hold for my experience. Specifically, battery backup works and sound quality of messages is excellent. Only negative: too many words spoken by the machine and they sometimes seem to overlap\n",

The unit\u0027s appearance and styling is sleek and modern. The controls layout is good with everything in view and accessible on the top. My last machine had some of its controls on the sides causing me to have to pick it up and turn it around and around looking for a particular control. This machine is better in that respect. \n\n3. Learning to use it is a very easy and intuitive process especially if you have used other machines. The included instructions clearly explain how to use its less obvious features.\n\nThings I didn\u0027t like: Nothing, really. \n\nBut some minor annoyances include:\n\n1. The electronic accent of the generated voice of the machine was a little hard to understand at first. But I quickly \"learned\" its accent. Your callers will never hear it after you record your own greeting which will be clear and sound like you. Otherwise, your callers will hear a default message in the machine\u0027s voice.\n\n2. I installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into AC. Removing the battery, then plugging in the AC, then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally.

Because the hard drive spins to lift the heads above the disk, moisture from condensation will cause the head to crash if, brought in from a cold car and turned on.

The cost difference between buying it at a Best Buy store and Amazon online will not be much, and you\u0027ll have to wait a few days to have it in your hands, but you get to avoid the drive to the store.

I have not had an issue with either the software or the drive, and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract.

    "\nLet me just preface this review by mentioning that I read many customer reviews(here and elsewhere) on this product before purchasing it. I focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws. After using this keyboard for almost 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality. \n\nCommand Pad: Many reviews bash this feature. It is quite a basic pad as compared to some, but it gets the job done. My only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrl-alt-delete. During games such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever. The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me. The customers who claimed it to be \"impossible\" and \"buggy\" seem to be computer illiterate at best, and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews, possible English illiterate as well. If you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad.\n\nKeyboard: The quietness, response, and overall feel of the keys rival any Logitech design. I am a huge fan/customer of Logitech equipment, and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality. Saitek took a more simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc...) and the price shows it.\n\n*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of key-symbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. \n\nLast and probably least comes the aesthetics, of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark, the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch, especially for the keyboard deficient, I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I\u0027ve been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination, apparently an oversight on their part. \n\nI will recap this lengthy review by recommending this keyboard to any capable computer enthusiast who desires a good value.  \n",
    "\nUpgraded from 19\" Viewsonic CRT. This monitor is superb!

Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau, absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can\u0027t comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27\u0026quot; Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36\u0026quot; does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again.

    "\nI agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I\u0027ve listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I\u0027ve actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before!  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC.\n\nAudio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.\n\nMy biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually, I wear high-quality buds.  So, perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.\n\nSo, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.\n\nUPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also, the comfort is much better.  They don\u0027t pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you\u0027re thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead\n",
    "\nI purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone.  The combination is killer.  I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO, this is too complementary.  For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone. \n",
    "\nAll 3 kids have a Tunebase.  It works great, easy to use.  It also charges the iPod while we travel\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They\u0027ve included Koss \"The Plug,\" Sennheiser PX100, Koss UR29, Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far, this has been the closest I\u0027ve had to a good balance.\n\nFor my tastes (not necessarily anybody else\u0027s), strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR-NC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears, despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They\u0027re also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years, I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s.\n\nThe K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture, the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. Isolation isn\u0027t as good as the UR29, but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller, but they\u0027re a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 55-60% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds, I now run at 35-40% comfortably. In terms of comfort, they\u0027re comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don\u0027t bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You\u0027d be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You\u0027ll know if you\u0027ve unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here\u0027s an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn\u0027t get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that\u0027s as good a seal as you need. I hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don\u0027t use these pads, so I don\u0027t think they\u0027re really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. In fact, without the pads, I barely feel the headband at all.\n\nOverall, I\u0027m satisified, especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way, don\u0027t be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada. Read the whole warranty sheet! A separate section on the sheet covers a limited warranty for these countries, so yes, it is covered\n",

    "\nI initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It\u0027s audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59\u0027s tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).

    "\nI bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because I trust Toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.  We have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained.  We haven\u0027t had any problems with the mechanics of the player.  We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination.  Also, the battery has never run out, and charges quickly.  My only problem with it is that the volume doesn\u0027t go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner.  But, my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway, so it wasn\u0027t that big a deal for us. \n",
    "\nThis DVD player is great for the road, and even at home when you don\u0027t want to be bothered. Unless the are much loud noises happening around you, the players\u0027 speakers work fine. It comes with all of the accesories you\u0027d want, including a car outlet, wall adapter, remote, and the battery. It charges in under 4 hours, and plays for over 3 hours. \n\nThe player is sleek and so is the battery, but together are a bit bulky, not bad. Screen quality is good, great for a portable. Made of good quality materials. I\u0027ve had it for a month and nothing is showing signs of wear-n-tear.\n\nA recommended accessory to purchase is a carrying case, which will haul all your add-ons that are included. I bought the targus sport, which is great also. For 160 bucks, it\u0027s well worth it!\n",
    "\nI do not have a hearing problem, but my previous cordless phones were inaudible even at high volume.. this phone fills the bill -- at least so far!  The only caveat: no speakerphone, which would be handy considering the amount of time most of us spend on hold.\n",
    "\nThis car kit works very well. The screen is a bit larger than other DVD players of similar type. The only down side is that the battery only charges for about 2 hours (shorter than many movies). So, if you are going to use this in the car, you need to be able to charge it\n",
    "\nWe bought this unit from Sam\u0027s Club right before a trip to Disney World. (8 hours in the car with a toddler--eek!)  However, it was/is perfect!  We still use it for trips around town when we\u0027re in massive traffic or our son is being really fussy.  The case that keeps the dvd player on the back of the seat needs a little work, but we figured out a way to make it work for us.  Also, the remote doesn\u0027t work well, but we don\u0027t really need to use it as a DVD usually lasts long enough between stops\n",
    "\nThe cable was a good price, and it fit my printer perfect. Worth the few pennies I paid\n",
    "\nThese speakers are great for the common traveller and have great clean music. the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it doesn;t fofill the height of volume I wished. It is pretty loud, but I like really loud. I do not own this but one of my friends does I hoe to get logi3 i station for my ippod it seems awsome according to the reviews\n",
    "\nThese speakers are not what i had expected from their size, price, and looks.  Their quality, even at high volumes, exceeds many other speakers i\u0027ve seen at double the price tag.  The reason I bought these was because of the other reviews and the size.  Another reason was the proposed battery life, 35 hours on 4 aaa batteries, not bad at all.  So far its been very close.  I have heard the other speaker (systems) and yes the JBL OnStage and the Bose Sounddock are both very good and do live up to their reputations, but your stuck with using them only when there is an outlet nearby\n",
    "\nI spent a lot of time reviewing Toaster Ovens to replace our 8 year old Delonghi Alfredo one. Most of the others had so-so features or bad enough reviews that made me pass on them; however, with the 5-star review and Cuisinart name, I chose the TOB-30BC.  It toasts, it bakes, it looks nice and it has the knobs that my hubby likes in lieu of digital. Overall, it\u0027s a great oven and we have no complaints with it\u0027s cooking abilities or the sturdiness of the unit; but less than a month later, one of the knobs broke off the unit. They are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening. My hubby sent an email to Cuisinart and they are sending a replacement knob, but one would have expected better engineering from a name like Cuisinart\n",
    "\nWhen we needed speaker systems for a batch of new workstations, price was the main consideration. The price for these units was well below budget.  Since our main application for them was for audio-enhanced CAT (Computer Assisted Training), High fidelity and volume were not issues.  They worked admirably for the purpose.\n\nThe use of a USB port for the power supply was a clever twist. One of my aggravating support woes is keeping speaker power adapters matched up with corresponding speakers.  I had been buying unpowered (unamplified) units with no manual volume control.  The USB trick gives me just what I want\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve purchased several Logitech mice(cordless optical)and I\u0027ve been satisfied with all of them, except for the battery life.  I had to change the batteries in my previous mouse once a month.  This new Logitech mouse is terrific.  It\u0027s been several months and I have not had to change the batteries yet ... and I am not even using the on-off switch (I want to test the battery life without the switch first).  Battery issues aside, the mouse is smooth, light and accurate.  It was simple to install and I\u0027d buy it again in a heartbeat\n",
    "\nthis stereo works great and its cute and small so it doesnt take up alot of room, it lights up blue when u turn it on in the dark and i love the remote, now i dont have to get up to switch the station\n",
    "\nI bought this headset and I must say it\u0027s a great buy. First off it\u0027s lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams. It\u0027s small which definately helps when your wearing it around. At times it\u0027s like you don\u0027t even feel liek your wearing anything. Exactly how a headset should be. I\u0027ve place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires. The only problem I have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset. Not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones. But that a small price to pay for such a great, inexpensive headset like this one\n",
    "\nI was looking for comfy earphones to replace my Phillips one I got awhile back cos the rubber coating had fallen off and I stumbled on this one. I was a bit skeptical about the volume control thinking it would give out after a few times of sliding up and down but it works wonderfully and is so light and responsive to touch as well as being sturdy. \n\nI started out using the foam that came with it but that proved to be a bother and pretty much useless as the plastic earbuds are comfy enough. And they stay in your ears like glue. No more readjusting and I loved that.\n\nFor the price, this SO worth it.\n",
    "\nI bought These earbuds for the first time 3 years ago for $15 now u can get them for under $10 They last more than six months of hard wear and tear  before they need replacing awsome i\u0027ve been using them for a long time and don\u0027t plan on changin\n",
    "\nLenmar Is great to work with, When Beach Audio will not do exchanges for faulty equipment. Beach Audio told me I would need to purchase another one then when they get the faulty one back they would refund my money for the second one that I had to purchase. POOR RETURN POLICY. So I just sent it to Lenmar under the warranty and they sent me a new one. Only took one week to get it. GO LENMAR.\nI\u0027ve been able to watch on a 10in. Portable DVD Two (2hr) movies on just this battery with a little to time to spare. ***NICE BATTERY*** \n",
    "\nI really likethe design on this Protector, and bought 3.\n\nIt allows you to plug multiple transformers in, and still have room for regular plugs. Slipping plus in is a firm push, but not that tough. \n\nI also like the fact that it gives you a warning light if you get up around 12 amps.. Cool, but you have to keep in mind a 15 amp circuit shoulldn\u0027t have 12 amps to one plug..\n\nThe cord restraint system slides out to hold all the cords, then wedges backin to hold them in place. A bit hard to set up, and a zip tie could achieve the same thing, altough this is way easier if you change things\n",
    "\nOverall, I like this surge protector and would buy it again. I bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets, six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brick-style transformer plugs. I did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration, and this unit always came up.  It has worked just fine for the month or so I\u0027ve owned it. I particularly appreciate the angled plug, which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem.\n\nI only have two quibbles with the APC--the color and the stiffness caused by the plug-activated safety shutters.  Plugging and unplugging cords requires some force to overcome the safety shutters, which could be a problem if you are trying to get something plugged or unplugged while the unit is in an awkward position or hard-to-reach location.  On a much more minor note, the black unit and cord stand out quite a bit against light-colored walls and carpets, even when tucked behind a desk.\n\nI don\u0027t use the phone or coax plugs, so I don\u0027t know if my unit has the problem (or \"feature\") other reviewers have reported with Internet signal degradation\n",
    "\nMy mp830 has performed well in the time that I\u0027ve had it.  My family members have found it easy to use as well.  I was saddened at the early demise of my Epson cx6400 which suffered from a common problem of dried ink clogging the feeder tube.  I chose the Canon after reading good reviews, and I got it for an excellent price right here on Amazon plus free shipping.  It still sells for more at my local Office Depot and Best Buy. In truth I haven\u0027t tried all of it\u0027s claimed capabilities, but I\u0027m happy with what it\u0027s been able to do thus far.     \n",
    "\n   I use this in my videography business, primarily for weddings.  So far I\u0027ve never had a problem, and the mic has always given me a clear recording of voices from a lapel position.\n   I use it in conjunction with my iRiver-795, to record the sound directly, and it\u0027s worked like a dream... recommende\n",
    "\nThese 2.0 speakers sound great (and not just for their size), are adjustable, small, and good looking. I\u0027m about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when I turned the volume up so I could understand human speech. I\u0027m happy I spent the money. These are real quality in my opinion\n",
    "\nI recently bought an altec lancing headset for $20 and it was the worst headset investment I\u0027ve made. Horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two. So I bought this headset and I have been quite pleased with it. The mic output is extremely crisp. While talking with clients they said that it sounds like I\u0027m talking on the telephone with them or better. They are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing. All in all a good headset.\n",
    "\nWorks good for me. Some time one can hear some interference but over all a pretty good product\n",
    "\nThis product is awsome, i intalled it on my car with a sony stereo system, i placed the end of the ilink cable inside of a compartment of my car so i could put my ipod in, the sound quality that the cable delivers its outstanding, besides, it does not look like a cheap cable, it has a thick rubber coating that gives it some stiffness....\nIf you are realy thinking on connecting your ipod to your home or car stereo this is the right solution\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve been using this CF card on my Nikon 4300 for a couple of months now.  It writes fast compared to my other CF (Canon stock, from another camera).  However, start up of the camera takes longer (because of the size), and as more pictures are stored, there is a noticeable degradation in speed in writing.  I\u0027ve also used this on a Dell Axim, and it worked great!  No problem in formatting\n",

    "\nThere are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:\nI got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2\u0027s that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2\u0027s had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don\u0027t do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\nAs a last comment, I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon !  (no - I don\u0027t work for or invest in them ;-\n",
    "\nI bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. By the way, I\u0027ve owned the Sony MDR-V600\u0027s for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now\n",

    "\nAlthough there are more expensive options, if you\u0027re just looking for something to keep your iPod from sliding all over in the car, the iSqueez is a great option.\n\nI use this with the Monster iCarPlay FM Transmitter/Charger, which uses the dock connector.  I can\u0027t get my iPod mini to fit all the way down in where it should because of this, but it still fits in there well enough to stay in place.\n\nI find that it holds the iPod at a great angle for viewing the screen from where you\u0027re sitting (though I\u0027d recommend putting the passenger in charge of finding music)\n",

I carry it around on a little pouch on my keys that I keep on my belt loop. When I pull it out of the pouch it will sometimes pull off the cap and skin.

It was really simple and it worked well with our Comcast/Netgear wireless cable modem.\n\nExcellent product\n",
    "\nI\u0027m not entirely sure how other people are finding ways to damage their earphones, but I have used the same pair since the summer of 2000 (purchased from Amazon), and I have never had any difficulties besides losing the essential earpiece covers, which were easily replaced. When they are wound up in their little yellow case, the headphones\u0027 wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that don\u0027t offer such security.\n\nCompared to other headphones I have used, especially noise cancelling of both active and passive varieties, these phones have superior bass response, and all levels of sound seem reasonably clear.\n\nI have used these earphones with many different devices over five years: CD players, MP3 players (including iPods), Pocket PCs, desktops, and notebooks. They always sound great, EXCEPT - due to their greater sensitivity to sound, I often am able to detect the hiss caused by poorly designed audio hardware, which I otherwise wouldn\u0027t hear with over-ear phones. Pocket PCs especially seem prone to this, as their audio hardware is crammed so tightly in with noisy backlit screens and processors\n",

    "\nI purchased my iTrip about 4 months ago and now can give an objective review of the product.  The iTrip is a good choice over competitors\u0027 products and offers a good value for the money.  Radio reception is good; I especially like the changing channels feature.  The fact that it charges the iPod while in use even makes it better.  The only negative thing that I\u0027ve discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.  That\u0027s mostly due to rattles and I imagine will get worse with time.  \n\nOverall, good product, good value for the money, and if carefully handled, will last a long time. \n",

    "\nThis review concerns the \"v3\" hardware and firmware v3.0_20 - I did not purchase from Amazon.\n\nFor the most part, everything works pretty well.  I have discovered a bug where the log is not cleared after a scheduled-email out, which leads to strange behavior for the log-emailing function.  I can always go into the web-interface to view or clear it with no problem.  Another thing to note regarding the log is that VPN (not pass-thru) has its own separate log area, which does not get emailed out.\n\nAs expected, Netgear support is mediocre.  Level 1 support can only handle very simple issues and Level 2 support is VERY slow.  I recommend you use the incident-submission area of the \"My Netgear\" website, so you can more easily track/respond to support incidents.\n\nFor those of you using the FR114p model, this is basically the same thing with 8-connection VPN service minus the printer port.\n\nI figure, after a few more firmware revisions, this will be a really good unit\n",
    "\nThe navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on. Our Toyota Highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top, but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well.

    "\nI have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year. I have been very happy with them, and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup. \n\nThe Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that\u0027s the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\n\nThe Bad: Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them, but they\u0027re not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you\u0027re sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn\u0027t make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won\u0027t stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \n\nOther Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. Also, I often wear it when I\u0027m not using it, because you can forget it\u0027s there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However, I blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug.\n\nI bought mine at Target, where they were labelled $24.99, on \"clearance\" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another \"clearance\" price), I bought a second pair as a backup. I\u0027m glad I did -- I\u0027m still using the second pair. Battery life is great. I don\u0027t know how many hours I get, but I can go at least a couple of weeks using my iPod for at least a couple of hours per day, listening to podcasts and audiobooks\n",

It may be my cats that walk on it at night and press a weird sequence wit their paws :). The only cure I have found is to pull the power plug, which reboots it\n",
    "\nAmazon has a nice price on the JBL Duet Speakers (July 2006 - 36.95) dealmac is a site I used and returned to amazon.\n\nI purchased these for my office desk where I wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening. Anything from Ambient, to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely, nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers, as the 2-pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the \"hints\" of bass in the music but no thud, if that\u0027s what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music, sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. \n\nBuild quality is \"ok\". I got the white speakers and they are the nice \"Mac\" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  \n\nThe design is very modern and cool tho. They look nice on my desk.\n\nYou will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully... break in. They sound awful right out of the box and after maybe one hour of keeping these on they will sound better.\n\nOn the low end of speakers out right now, these will probably sound the best and are most modern design, compared to the black boxes out there\n",

It is really nice to have twice the screen real-estate.\n\nI figured that mostly I would put background stuff on the laptop screen (like email) and use my big hi-resolution screen for what I was activly working on.  But, now that the laptop screen is up at eye level, I tend to use it just as often as the big monitor!  It turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it, even though I was not aware of that until I got it raised. \n",
    "\nOne of the least expensive ways out there to raise your computer screen to eye level. I am 6\u00273, so when I sit I am still pretty high in the air. With this stand I am able to sit with great posture and look straight ahead to my screen. I would definitely suggest getting one of these if you\u0027ve ever thought about raising your monitor up off the desk\n",
    "\nI\u0027m overly critical of sound quality. At home i have the Tritton surround sound headset running off optical connection. this doesnt\u0027 compare to that but the Tritton is $99 too. \n\nFor the $ this is really nice. Sound, microphone and wire quality are all good. Controls are easy to use and the software is easy to use too. They\u0027re also fairly comfortable. Good headset for work\n",
    "\nI love this printer. I purchased it to print 8X10s from my digital camera. The ink doesn\u0027t fade over time like my HP did.\n",
    "\nAs you may already know, this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these Panasonic models: KX-TG2700/KX-TG2720, KX-TG2730/KX-TG2740. \n\nThe Panasonic KX-TGA271V, does not need (or use) a telephone jack. It simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above.\n\nThis phone was also very easy to register. (It had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) I simply had to press the \"MUTE\" button on my base unit and then press the \"PLAY\" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the LCD display on the phone!) Please know that I did find the Panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.\n\nSome features that are NOT mentioned in this description which ARE included are: finger grips/ergonomic sizing on the sides of the phone, the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone (the base unit to the KX-TG2730 has a digital answering machine, and I suspect the other Panasonic models do as well) ---- THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE, YES THE KX-TGA271V WILL PLAY YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGES OFF THIS PHONE THROUGH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OF IT!!!, a separate \"call waiting\" dedicated button is also included.\n\nAlso, this phone will use any standard headset, it does NOT need a Panasonic branded headset. This was very important for me because I ofen use a headset and I do not want to purchase another one. I have since learned that ALL cordless phone headsets can be used on ANY type of cordless phone! \n\nPlease know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the KX-TG2730 system (that is the model that I have.) Also, the KX-TG2730 phone can\u0027t be charged in this charger, and vice versa. That is (likely) because the KX-TGA271V phone is slightly smaller and weighs less. \n\nThe face of the phone is white with a purple trim. The back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half. The \"white\" in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white, and the \"purple\" is not shiny at all. Some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the KX-TG2730 model. And the LCD screen is not flat, it is indented slightly, and bordered in silver. \n\nI purchased this phone from an Amazon.com merchant and am very pleased with it. I noticed that another Amazon.com merchant is selling the same phone that I purchased for less ($30.), however that merchant has HORRIFIC feedback and I was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that I would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work! \n\nPanasonic makes very good phones. The only (big) problem is the battery life. The batteries often die after less than 90 minutes. I have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries. However, this is still not a perfect solution. So, I had to purchase another set of cordless phones (Uniden.) I now keep two phones in each of the rooms that I had each of the Panasonic phones, and so far have not run in to any problems. I hope Panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon.\n\nAll in all this is an excellent phone. I hope the extra details that I provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision. Amazon.com rarely provides specific details to these types of questions (does Amazon.com only employ braindead dimwits?) and the Panasonic Website does not offer this info\n",
    "\nI recently bought an HP 17\" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling. This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder. It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed- that came in handy in the airport.\n\nThis case looks extremely sturdy (well built!)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17\" laptop, PDA, Cell phone, computer mouse, one-time-use cameras, Ipod, and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books, keys, a folder filled with directions and plane tickets, a notebook, and two dvd\u0027s in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn\u0027t likely to fall off easily).\n\nThis bag is extremely well-designed. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay! Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.\n\nBecause this bag does all that and more, it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However, I am 5\u00271\" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York. It looks great, if I needed to go to a meeting with my laptop I would gladly take it in this case. It looks professional enough.\n\nhappy buying!\nps. let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17\" laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible. Also, in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon!! If you have a smaller laptop, this case will work just fine too! It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case.\n",
    "\nVery reasonable price and a must have as a spare for those that leave affixed to windshield year-round. Fast shipping. A great shopping experience\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget. I\u0027ve owned mine for about three years and I love it. I use it nightly. The application I find this perfect for is Audio Books stored on MP3. This of one of the only small, portable MP3 players that has it\u0027s own speakers. I go to bed listening to audio books and I don\u0027t want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around. However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip, where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.\n\nThe big gripes I\u0027ve seen repeated in the other reviews are:\n 1) Poor radio reception.\n 2) No Bass from the mini speakers.\n 3) Short Battery life.\n\n1) I never use this to listen to the radio, so I won\u0027t comment on it good or bad. But there are thousands of good and cheep radio\u0027s on the market so if you need a radio, go buy a radio.\n\n2) I\u0027ll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone\u0027s yield small bass. It\u0027s a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room, it\u0027s been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.\n\n3) Battery Life. I\u0027m surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 30-35 hours of use when I\u0027m on the road using the AA\u0027s. When at home or in a hotel, the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. \n\nPerhaps this is because I primarily play MP3 disks which it spins up to read into it\u0027s buffer then spins down until it needs more data. \n\nAnyway I wanted to toss in my two cents, as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners, and I would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a Walkman sized device.. It\u0027s my hope that we\u0027ll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit. But bottom line, I\u0027ve got my monies worth, and if anyone doesn\u0027t want theirs, I\u0027d be glad to take it off their hands.\n",

The hard case protects the iPod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs.  It also does not obscure the screen.  An enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit.  \nThis case is not compatible with a Bose Sounddock as the user must remove the iPod from the case.  Also, Contour Design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves.  I spent $5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case.  \nThe price seems high for a couple pieces of plastic but a case is essential and this is the best one for the 20 GB iPod. \n",

    "\nI\u0027ve had this controller for over a year now, and it still works great and reliably as ever.  After many months, the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little, but a quick jiggle and they\u0027d be back to center.  \n\nThe profiler software is excellent, allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse.  This allows you to play any game with the controller, even ones which don\u0027t naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell.  With the \"shift\" profile function, you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X-Wing Alliance, completely keyboard free, using only the gamepad.\n\nOnly downside: The D-pad is hard to control precisely.  It\u0027s difficult to press only Up, Down, Left or Right.  You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead.  This made the D-pad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter, but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway\n",
    "\nFirst, I should say that I\u0027m surprised at how sharp and clear the image is.  The display card at CompUSA said this monitor has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, and I\u0027m not sure what that means, but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture.  The contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels I looked at, which have a contrast ratio of around 500:1 to 700:1 (including Samsung\u0027s own 20.1\" non-widescreen model).  Everything is crystal-clear, which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies.  It is also good for gaming - Half-life 2 and Unreal Tournament 2004, for example, both look great.\n\nIts wide-screen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks.  It also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 4:3 (which makes a square picture centered on the screen), so if you have any games or other applications that don\u0027t support widescreen modes, you can use 4:3 mode so that the picture doesn\u0027t look stretched and distorted.  Plus, the monitor has DVI, analog VGA, S-Video, and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees, and it has built-in speakers and a headphone jack.\n\nBeing a flat-panel display, it is also lightweight and compact, which is ideal for areas where space is limited.  This is my first flat-panel display, and I was surprised at how lightweight it really is.\n\nAll of these features, especially the sharp image, make this a great monitor, and it is worth the money\n",

If you don\u0027t then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your GPS and that is no fun at all.\nI have used mine for over six months and it works without a hitch. A nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you don\u0027t have excess cordage lying around your dashboard. Right now I loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism. Others may run into this problem. The alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles. A minor hitch but not earthshaking.\n",

And for that reason, since it works I do NOT intend to flash the firmware to the latest, as the saying goes if it isnt boke don\u0027t fix it.\n\nBTW home network is a mix of print server, wired PC, wireless Apple powerbook, everything running smoothly\n",

    "\nAfter reading the online reviews of this product vs. the portable product I went with this one. Portability is not much of a need, I plan on being around a power outlet. The sound is in line with a radio/boom box of the same size and it\u0027s about the same weight. I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal. Keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit. I have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and I can hear it all over the first floor of my home. So far I\u0027m happy that I bought it\n",

    "\nThis case is a veritable dirt magnet.  It attracts more lint than I ever knew existed on my desk.  However, it protects very well.  One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen.  However, it doesn\u0027t even touch the ipod.  Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn\u0027t quite as sensitive, it makes it more precise in my opinion, seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod, even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It\u0027s still vibrant.  \n\nOne complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button.  Truthfully this doesn\u0027t bother me, because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button.  But those without could have a great deal of difficulty.  Also, the hole for the headset isn\u0027t quite large enough, and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I\u0027m not using the earbuds that came with the ipod, so I do not know how those would fare).  \n\nOverall, it\u0027s a great case that you won\u0027t lose your grip on.  It protects well, and you never have to take it off, even to plug it in.  I would recommend it, though it is a bit pricy.    \n\nIn a bit of an update, with this case on, my iPod survived a ferret attack, with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case.  I think this case is well worth the money.  My iPod could have been destroyed, but it\u0027s perfect\n",
    "\nPrinters have gotten inexpensive.  Let\u0027s face it; the game is, cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills.

I have used every function, am pleased with them all.\n\nSure, it feels a little flimsy; it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office.  However, it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months, so that flimsiness isn\u0027t really even a complaint.

    "\nWe bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago.  One handset gave us problems from the start, but was promptly replaced when returned for service.  The system works fine in our 2-story, 2,300 sq. ft. home.  I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house.  As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street.  I like the features, including paging system, call transfer, and handset speakerphone.  Being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus.  I think the sound quality is very good, and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive.  I agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag.\nOverall I feel it works as advertised, and we\u0027ll be using it for a long time\n",

    "\nOperation of the Sony DVPNSS550/B single disc DVD player has been straight forward.  Picture quality is very good, and the desired basic features have functioned without problems.  In other words, in the 2 1/2 months since we have owned this player, quality and reliability have been high.  Price too was very reasonable.  That means durability is the last quality to consider, which is why I have given the player a 4 rather than a 5.  There is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years.  But we won\u0027t know that for years.   \n",

    "\nThis is a great multi-function printer/scanner/copier/fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload.\n\nPrint quality is excellent, scanning quality is excellent, copying quality is excellent, faxing is faxing.\n\nThe control software is fine; not great, but it does the job.  The networking features, including built-in wireless, makes this printer a snap to integrate into your office / business using a wireless network.  \n\nSome concerns:  after heavy usage the top document feeder, used for scanning, faxing, or photocopying a stack of loose documents, begins to jam.  The rollers need to be cleaned to avoid this, and getting jammed paper out of the top document feeder is very difficult.   \n\nHowever, the fact that this piece of equipment even has a document feeder for this sort of functionality is pretty good.  \n\nThe fax log keeps a record of outgoing faxes and you can re-send them easily enough, but you can\u0027t re-print faxes received; the fax log merely logs their reception, but not the fax itself.\n\nOverall it\u0027s a good multi-function at a reasonable price with a lot of functionality built into it.  Would recommend to anyone who only has a light document load, with maybe the occasional large document scanning / copying requirement\n",
    "\nAs long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall!  Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you\u0027d swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.\n\nThe only things to be aware of are the following:  First, you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.  Second, they don\u0027t have an inline volume control, which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s.  Finally, plenty of sound escapes.  So don\u0027t crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith\u0027s funeral.  \n\nOther than that, you have no excuse.  Put your iPod\u0027s lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong, and order these (or if you don\u0027t want to fork out $40, order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these, and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range.) \n\n",
    "\nGood sound for the price, and very durable. Discrete design. I prefer the \"plug\" design to other headphones. They don\u0027t fall out, and I can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane, it makes almost no difference. Just be careful in the traffic ;-)\n\nThe  sound is good, especially for music where the bass is most important, but the treble is also good for pop and rock. The middle range is a bit dry for e.g. classical music, but still good enough for an mp3-player. \n\nI have two pairs.\n\n",
    "\nThese earphones are excellent quality. Noise that gets in from outside is so low that I can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me. In addition, the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones. \n\nThese earphones do in fact rest in your ear. It can be slightly uncomfortable to put them in the first time, but you quickly get used to it, especially when sound is playing. In addition, the package includes three sets of differently sized earpieces including the default mid-sized piece shown.\n",
    "\nI just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano.  It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit.  Has anyone experienced this with theirs?  My first generation nano does not experience this noise.  I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement.\n\nJust a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective.  Lesson learned for everyone else, if you don\u0027t have to get a new toy right when it comes out...wait...let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself\n",
    "\nI have never been a fan of the Ipod. I have been an Iriver H120, H320, and H340 owner. I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500. The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple, don\u0027t let me down\n",
    "\nThe KOSS Pro-4AA\u0027s were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP\u0027s or CD\u0027s).  Also, they require a 1/4\"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.\n\nThese Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators \u0026 attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studio-reference headphones)\n2) Tight headband - as noted, the fit is fatiguing if your \u0027hat size\u0027 is greater than 7 1/2.\n3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it\u0027s actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).\n\nPOSITIVES:\n1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA\u0027s is almost impossible to beat.\n2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.\n3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil.\n4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.\n\nThe sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.\n\nThe biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA\u0027s for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they\u0027re not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware.  If you just want \u0027jogging/exercise music\u0027, then these will not work well. If you want hi-fidelity at a bargain price, the Pro-4AA\u0027s are still the best choice around.\n\n",
    "\nBought this mouse over 3 months ago, and its still going strong. The batteries last forever (I\u0027ve never replaced them yet). My only problem is that at times, I will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom, but it won\u0027t seem to turn off! I reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again, and this always does the trick. Other than that, very ergonomic, extremely smooth and precise.\n\nI like the solid feel of a slightly weighty mouse, and with the batteries, this mouse feels just right.

    "\nMy first purchase of the Q9b resulted in a return as the display wasn\u0027t mounted properly within the plastic housing. This resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1/4\" and made the viewing unpleasant. The screen also wasn\u0027t very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100%. Having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it. Suffice to say, quality control missed this one.\n\nAfter getting a new Q9b replacement, I unfortunately had a bad pixel. After using the Q9b for a week now, I noticed some red aliasing between characters. The crispness of the display is fine but I changed display fonts to 120dpi to make it look better. The control buttons on the monitor are too small. The built-in speakers leave less than desired and useless. \nThe Q9b does not have DVI ports. At 1280x1024 mode its fine for doing basic computing like web surfing and office applications. Viewing DVD movies at full 1280x1024 mode was difficult to watch.  At smaller sizes (400x300) was fine.\n\nAll in all, the Q9b is not a bad monitor for the price for general computing work\n",

    "\nI have used GPS units from Cobra, Garmin, and Lowrance.  I consider this Cobra unit to be one of the best.  I started with the Cobra but it was stolen after a month.  Then I bought the Lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the Cobra. I returned the Lowrance and bought the Garmin 340.\n\nAdvantages of the Cobra is that it has a large screen and a solid mount (despite its size).  The interface isn\u0027t quite as intuitive as Garmin but once you learn it it is actually better.  The traffic service is also nice (costs more with the Garmin).  The Cobra is the most capable of the GPS units I mentioned but overall I am happier with the Garmin because of it\u0027s smaller size and lower price\n",
    "\nThe unit operates as good as any other GPS system available, plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches.  I am very impressed with the GPS, but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed.  The unit falls off the window and from the dash, plus the power cord comes out too easily.  The unit deserves a five star rating, but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided.\n",
    "\nI would highly recommend reading the BusinessWeek review on this product that came out on September 12, 2005.  BusinessWeek as reviewed all the major GPS navigation options on the market and ranks the Cobra NAV ONE 4500 as number one.  Here is an excerpt from the BusinessWeek article:\n\n\"Cobra\u0027s NAV ONE 4500 and Garmin\u0027s StreetPilot 2720, which each sell for $800 to $1,000, use a more straightforward approach. The traffic info travels along with FM radio broadcasts from Clear Channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets. An FM antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system.\"\n\n\"I preferred the Cobra, mostly for its big, bright 5-inch screen and its built-in radio receiver. (The Garmin receiver is $200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio.) When you encounter traffic, a pop-up on the screen and a voice give you three options: Keep driving, reroute me, or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one.\n",
    "\nIf money was no object, I would prefer the totally wireless headset phone, however, this has been a great alternative.

I find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain, but, the product works great.  I have had no problems hearing anyone, nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me.  The earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off, even for someone with elfishly small ears like me! \n",
    "\nI\u0027ve owned this headphone for about a year now, and I\u0027ve got to say, after going through multiple headphones, this beats all others I\u0027ve tried. If this one ever broke (I doubt that\u0027ll happen anytime soon), I\u0027ll surely buy another one again!\n\nPros:\n\n- Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses, you won\u0027t feel uncomfortable.\n\n- Clear treble, middle, and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones, take time to \u0027break it in\u0027 to have it function the best it can (it means, to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time non-stop, about 24 or 32 hours).\n\n- Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also, it\u0027s single wire format.\n\nCons:\n\n- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won\u0027t fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\n\n- As some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements.\n\n- You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones, so it\u0027s not a huge negative point.\n\n- The headphone is quite big and on a small head, you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.\n\nThat\u0027s all I\u0027ve got to say, and overall, this headset is definitely worth your money\n",
    "\nI think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable.  Mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where I can get an open computer.  I have W2K at home with USB 1 and XP Pro at work with USB 2.  Never had any type of compatibility issue.  This 128 MB size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion.  I plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon.\n\nThe amazing this is that I have just removed my USB drive from a clean pair of pants that went through the wash and dry cycle.  And this was the second time.  I can\u0027t believe it still works.\n\nMaybe I\u0027ll have to start using that ridiculus cord and wear it around my neck.\n\nThrough away your zip and floppy disks and get one of these things.

    "\nI\u0027ve used the keyboard/mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all I would wish. Of course, any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup, but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.\n\nThe only drawback, and it is minor, is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally, it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit. Yes, it would draw down batteries more quickly, but as an option it would be user selected.\n\nAll in all, a good wireless keyboard/mouse combination, and one I am quite glad I purchased.\n\nLife is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body. \nBut rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming,\n\n\"WOW, Lord!

I still love it, and did get a *lot* of use out of it, but snapping 9V batteries on and off so many times caused the wires leading from inside the battery compartment to the \u0027snaps\u0027 that connect to the battery itself to break off.

    "\nI am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone.  It looks good, but more importantly, it feels good.  Button placement, weight, smoothness, everything was done well.  Coming from wired mice, the lack of a wire is very freeing.  I am also especially happy with how small the USB radio receiver is.  I am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is.\n\nWhat\u0027s strange is I bought the S 530 desktop set for Mac at the same time.  The mouse in that set looks nearly identical (except for color).  However, it has a different weight and simply doesn\u0027t feel quite as comfortable to use.  It only fits the hand the same but once you move it, it lacks the same comfort and ease of use as this mouse\n",
    "\nReceived this speaker as a replacement for the Advent AW-810 which did not work at all.  This one was much easier to install and calibrate!  Very happy with range and sound quality.  Highly recommended\n",
    "\nThese are very comfortable to wear, and the sound is great.  I use them out jogging, and they stay put, without any pressure on the ear.  The tight fit blocks out any outside noise, so be careful around traffic, as you cannot hear cars.  I would highly recommend these to anyone\n",
    "\nI bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great\n",
    "\nThe Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel was purchased in Sept. 2006. I have had this for two months at the time this review is being written.\n\nI bought this to replace the corded version of the same item. The cordless works as well as the corded one. The trackball doesn\u0027t has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did, but the difference is minimal. I wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use.\n\nI find the shape of the Logitech Trackman to fit the hand very naturally. It is also much less strenuous on the wrist than a normal mouse, which is why I use it.\n\nI replaced the corded one so that we could easily move the mouse to different locations for use. This is for home use with multiple users, with different mouse location preferences. I took the corded one to use at work, where it still performs flawlessly 8+ hours a day.\n\nI also have a Logitech cordless keyboard.\n\nThere are two places where both these items could be improved:\n- Each one of these items needs it own receiver. It would save some of my limited home desk space if these could be combined into one unit.\n- I initially had the receivers out of sight behing an LCD monitor. I found that it was necessary to move them away from the monitor to get them to work reliably. This is a documented requirement in the owners manual, but that necessity takes away from the convenience of the wireless. The receivers, as stated earlier, take up space I would rather not spare\n",
    "\nWe have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer.  It works just as well as the corded one when I\u0027m in my office.  For travel, the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel.  It\u0027s not a small, USB stick that goes in the back.  It\u0027s a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan.  I don\u0027t think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel.  All that said, I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me\n",

    "\nIf you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n\nSome notes on the contract:\n1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I\u0027m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\u0027s warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn\u0027t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don\u0027t cover accidents and they don\u0027t cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN\u0027T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don\u0027t hold me liable since I don\u0027t have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n\nAssuming they aren\u0027t jerks with their discretion and aren\u0027t too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn\u0027t get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

    "\nWe used the GTX600VP4 to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling. The 5-watt power gave us ample range. Does it reach 18 or 20 miles, don\u0027t know.  But 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem. Range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the Rocky Mountains. It\u0027s a great way to stay in touch when traveling. The batteries are rechargeable, both A/C \u0026 D/C. The ear pieces were very good for privacy. Very easy to use and well worth the price. A good investment.\n",
    "\nI was hesitant to get this, since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception.  Now that I bought it, I\u0027m very glad I have it.  It does all the things you might want in a disaster, inluding a flashlight, red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night), a siren (if you\u0027re trapped in a building), AC, battery, and crank power, and multiple radio bands.  While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM, FM, TV, and NOAA bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn\u0027t try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.\nOnly minor criticisms:  The case seems like an afterthought:  it doesn\u0027t hold the AC adapter; the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case, and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). However, it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.\nOverall, this is all you should need for light, siren, and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster\n",

The color is just so much more vivid using HDMI compared to component 3 wire connectors. Get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others\n",

Be sure to remove the RAZR battery to clear the access slot for the Micro SD.  The V3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems.  I used Motorola Phone Tools to transfer my entire music library.  The program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer. The entire music library...a full 1GB...transferred reasonably quickly.  The V3m is slow to access \"My Music\" using menu function #3 under \"Get Tunes \u0026 Tones\".  Function #6 \"Manage Music\" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good, but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.  The SanDisk 1GB MicroSD Card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the V3m as cell phone with \"MP3\" player\n",

    "\nOkay so it was about 8:45 at night. I was coming on to a 1/2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where I live. I was doing 60mph, the speed limit is 40. As I start to approach the bridge I start getting a small K-Band warning. I instantly slow down to the speed limit. As I start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so I slow down even more to 35 mph. Then it gets to full K-Band. I look to my left where there is a service parking area, and in the pitch dark I see the reflectors of the one and only Crown Vic Police Car. As I pass the police car, I start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead.  \n\nIf I didn\u0027t have this detector he would have gotten me doing 20 over the limit. Thank you Escort!\n",
    "\nThis is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50. The first one is in another car. It saved me many times for getting caught though I\u0027m not maniac driver. The detection range is very good, it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car. I love the blue color and it only costs $30 more than red. The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals, especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals, and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car. I\u0027m not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it won\u0027t help much, I have it turned off. Overall, it\u0027s very good detector, you will get payback if you own one. \n",

    "\nI got mine to work in about 30 min following S Huffs directions below (followed exactly).  There was only one thing not mentioned that I had to do to get it to work.  Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase, I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender.  Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5, this is what worked for me at any rate.\nI\u0027ve had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised.  I gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain.\n\nFrom S Huff: The tips that Anthony Taylor left helped me get it working... but I still had some issues. I\u0027ve added onto his tips from his review below \n\n1-Disable WEP on your Router or AP \n2-Hold the auto-configuration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue) and unplug while still holding button. Plug back in after 10-15 secs. \n3-open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 (default ip of expander), a window will pop up. leave the user name blank and put admin as a password (this is default password). \n4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP,change password on the expander if desired \u0026 save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) \n5-Enable WEP on the expander, once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase), save settings again. \n5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it\u0027s now setup for WEP and your router isn\u0027t - keep this in mind - drove me nuts. \n6-Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP. \n7 - UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in -- Bang you\u0027re DONE. Enjoy \n",

    "\nI have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.\nAs far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon\u0027s price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product\n",
    "\nThere is a little story before this:\n\nI bought a pair of Sony MDR-XD100\u0027s (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that, even at full volume on the player, it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.\n\nOn with the review:\n\nYes, there is a slight hiss, but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft (IE, on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone, this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won\u0027t bo too much of an issue.\n\nIt also does a great job of amplifying the signal, it works very well, I can now listen to my XD100\u0027s properly (and they are very good!). I haven\u0027t used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very, very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half, my headphones start to distort.\n\nIf your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though, mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course, the hiss but it isn\u0027t too loud \u0026 I can live with it.\n\nI reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer\n",
    "\nThis does what it\u0027s advertized too.  I like not having wires.  The iPod in my bag, and just the headset.  It would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset, ie turn off the headset, receiver and ipod all from the headset.  Instead, I have to get the ipod back out, turn it off, turn the receiver off, then turn the headset off.\n\nOtherwise, the sound is good and the headset hasn\u0027t broken for me yet\n",
    "\nI picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon, and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do, let it cure overnight).  Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses).  Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding.  My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650.  1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can\u0027t use the advance track feature of the headphones)\n",

    "\nPurchase/Service:\n\nFor $2,200 at Amazon, this was a great purchase since it would have cost over $2,700 at a retail store (including tax and shipping).  Eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the Amazon estimate, unloaded the TV right to the TV stand, and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture / sound worked, I signed for it.  And, Eagle asked if I wanted the packaging carted away.\n\nVery pleased with the service part so far.....\n\nMy Set-up:\n\nS6187 61\" HDTV\nSony AV and 5.1 surround (this is not a digital unit.....I wasn\u0027t sure it would work but there are three options to hook-up a home theater: 1) Basic connection; 2) Optical; 3) HDMI)\nSony DVD\nMotorola HD-CATV box (We use Comcast)\nSony VCR\n\nExperience:\n\nAs far as the tv, the HD channels look sharp and clear, however the non HD channels aren\u0027t as sharp as my 36\" Sony CRT TV (there are several settings on the Samsung for 16:9, 4:3 and wide format; setting to 4:3 or wide for non HD channels improves the picture quality a little).  But it doesn\u0027t effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD, and it blows me away.\n\nThe TV controls are simple to use, and the on screen menu\u0027s are easy to navigate.  \n\nThe sound out of the TV is not adequate for surround sound, but I hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes HD come to life.\n\nI like the fact that you can connect components to an AV and/or the TV, so there is room for 3 additional components with my set-up.  \n\nI also hooked up my laptop (there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the TV).  After changing the video settings on the Laptop (the mannual does a nice job for XP users), it was incredible!   \n\nThe camcorder hooks up to the side of the TV, so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall.  It was a simple set-up, and again, the picture quality just blew me away!!!\n\nI highly recommend this TV to anyome looking for a 50\" plus TV\n",

    "\nIt is remarkable that, even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence, none of them are near-perfect.  I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.\n\nThe case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don\u0027t have to worry about it scratching.\n\nThe case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.\n\nThe most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel, but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling.  Actually, I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.\n\nThe only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases.\n\nUnfortunately, even though this is a great case, it is not readily available.  I couldn\u0027t find it in any store, and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers.  I ordered from Applelinks, and they delivered it to me in four days.  Whatever you do, don\u0027t order from the iSkin company directly.  I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases.  They should re-dedicate themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them\n",

    "\nThis printer was purchased for my wife\u0027s birthday and arrived\nin two to three days. Considering money spent the printer\nworks quite well. Pictures come out very good overall.

    "\nI tried both Microsoft\u0027s LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had \u0027em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. \n\nSo, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB\u0027s price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven\u0027t used so far.\n\nAlthough I haven\u0027t tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a \"USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing\" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.\n\nThe audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing.\n\nThe Orbit\u0027s special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven\u0027t tested in actual live conferencing yet.\n\nAll in all - for webcams, I\u0027m now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They\u0027ve certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you\u0027d better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I\u0027ve relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I\u0027ve generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech.\n\n",
    "\nEasy to operate and good focus. Just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam\n",
    "\nGarmin iQue M5\n\nI\u0027m very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it\u0027s not perfect, it\u0027s pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.\n\nIt has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn\u0027t very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he\u0027s learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It\u0027s very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you\u0027ve viewed your route before starting out.\n\nI used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it\u0027s generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn\u0027t always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you\u0027re going and if you\u0027re \"directionally challenged\" like I am, it becomes indispensible.\n\nThe car mounting bracket works fine.  It\u0027s popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car.\n\nI\u0027ve spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you\u0027ll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \n\nThe PDA has so many functions that it\u0027s hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I\u0027d find much use for a PDA but I\u0027m using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. And even though it isn\u0027t that intuitive, once you\u0027ve learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.\n\nWe\u0027ve called Garmin Tech Support a few times and, although they are only open during regular business hours, we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product.  Since a good GPS will run at least [...], this was a great bargain at around [...]  We\u0027ve purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won\u0027t wear out too quickly, as I\u0027ve heard Palm Pilots tend to do.  I\u0027m really enjoying the iQue.\n\n\n",
    "\nWe bought this about a month ago from Amazon.  The product itself seems fine - we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back.  At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However, you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn\u0027t always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also, it was missing certain stores, restaurants, etc. that had been around for awhile.\n\nWe liked that it is a PDA though.  My husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it.  This way, when he has to wait around, he will have something to do.  \n\nCONS: \n- You should be tech-savvy to get one of these set up\n- Match sure you get patches as unit will lock up\n- Manufacturer has DISCONTINUED this model.  They still offer some support but be warned that this is a DISCONTINUED model.\n- Since it became DISCONTINUED, it dropped in price about $60 two weeks after I bought it which annoys me somewhat\n- Will be spending extra to get bigger memory card\n- Came with EXPIRED Outlook coupon - why bother including this?\n\nPROS\n- Nice display and controls\n- Came with mount and dock (some don\u0027t - you have to buy extra)\n- We had no trouble with the suction cup mount (had to pry it off the window with a knife one time) but agree that most placement seems to block driver view through windshield\n- Also a PD\n",

    "\nNot much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture. You wouldn\u0027t think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an I-Pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the I-Pod.\nThe unit is not perfect, it does freeze occasionally, but the re-set function has always unlocked it. The video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also. But the conversion software was able to handle very large files. I suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions.\nSound quality is great. Combine this with Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds and you\u0027ll love it.\nThis is my forth MP3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product. The previous player, Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3, quit working the week the warranty ran out.\nThumbs up on this one\n",
    "\nI purchased this cable solely to connect my GPSmap 76S to my HP laptop.  So far it has performed perfectly.  I have not tried to use it for other applications yet, so I can\u0027t comment on how well it would work in other situations. \n",

It is very easy to transfer files to it I always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software.

Movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution hasn\u0027t been a problem. The design is probably the neatest looking out there (subjective I realize). The ONLY gripe I have w/ this monitor is lack of swivel (sigh). Other than that I\u0027m very pleased with everything about this screen\n",
    "\nWow...just got one of these at a great price, hooked it up to my Mac G4 via a DVID cable, and it boots up at native resolution (1680 x 1050) automatically - no muss, no fuss. Text is crisp and clean\n",

My old phone only captured 10 digits (xxx-xxx-xxxx) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first.  This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number.  I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in.  Very handy.  As far as being a phone, it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it\n",

    "\nThis is my first GPS and I wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking, hiking, kayaking, and in the car to. I found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls. Also the 2 times I called Garmin with questions I was able to talk to someone who is in the USA as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some. On the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software\n",
    "\nOk.. here\u0027s the deal.  I\u0027ve been an avid Magellan user for the past 3 years.  I love my Magellan.  I\u0027ve never liked the Garmins because of their clumsy interface (the buttons placed above the display NEVER made sense to me) and how the menu structure was built.  \n\nHowever.... We\u0027re planning a 2000 mile road trip from Utah up to the Oregon coast.  We needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time.  My wife bought me the Magellan eXplorist 600 for Fathers Day.  I forced myself to use it for two days (and believe me, it was torture).  I could go on and on about why I sent it back.  \nWhat I ordered as a replacement was the GPSMap 60Cx.  Now keep in mind that I felt like someone who had turned to the dark side.  \nI couldn\u0027t be happier with my decision.  \n\nWhile I agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps, and the expense of additional ones, this unit ROCKS!  It acquires satellites within seconds.  It has expandable memory.  It has a color screen.  It manages Geocaches.  It auto-routes.  It stores 1000 waypoints.  It has SiRF Technology.  It is a USB interface.  It has a belt clip.  It changes display contrast at night (automatically).  It slices...  It dices....\nSuddenly the Dark Side isn\u0027t so dark!!\n\nThis is a great unit that I would recommend to anyone. \n",
    "\nI had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that\u0027s what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.\n\nLike many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don\u0027t seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I\u0027ve never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.\n\nI installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner\u0027s manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner\u0027s manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). \n\nIt came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.\n\nAs far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that\u0027s in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \n\nI do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can\u0027t get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don\u0027t know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.\n\nIt came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  \n\nI do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer\u0027s USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can\u0027t remember it being dropped or anything, so I don\u0027t know what caused this, but it\u0027s pretty noticeable.  It doesn\u0027t seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.\n\nOverall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn\u0027t want an iPod\n",
    "\nPros: Easy to use, last for days without charging (depending on the use, of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging, and it lasted the trip), enough memory space, has radio, works as a recorder, small\nCons: Stopped working, froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago. When it\u0027s on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. \n\nBut overall i\u0027m happy with my MP3. I\u0027d recommend it\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve never written a review, but I\u0027ve relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other Amazon buyers, so I felt a really good product like the Anycom Bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review.\n\nI know experience and taste vary by individual, but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint.\n\nPros:\n\n- Bluetooth - connects immediately; provides smooth accurate tracking\n- Size - very portable; some may find it too narrow; I have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse\n- Battery life - I get at least 2 days out of it before charing and I\u0027m a fairly heavy user\n- USB charge attachment - allows you to continue to work while recharging\n- Product Design/Quality - Nicely engineered; good quality material- not tinny - it\u0027s built to take abuse\n\nCons:\n- Haven\u0027t really found any - It took me awhile to figure out how to connect until I read the manual line by line (I don\u0027t tend to do that) then I realized it was pretty straight forward.\n\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for a quality bluetooth traveling mouse this is the one.\n",
    "\nI was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer. The photo output is awesome and it\u0027s very fast!\n\nThere are only two things I would comment on that new users might not be aware of. I was ready to return the printer as I thought it was defective until I found out what the problems were.\n\n1) When the cartridges dry out, it will tell you that the cartridges are incompatible. This was confusing as I did have the correct cartridges in the printer. A \"replace cartridge\" message would have been less ambiguous.\n\n2) The printer has so far appeared \"dead\" once. When I went to turn it on, it would not do so. The solution is on HP\u0027s website - you must remove the rear door and do a hard reset. I did this and the printer worked fine again.\n\nThe printer does not come with a USB cable, but those can be easily bought for $14-20.\n",
    "\nI\u0027m a skeptic. No, I mean I\u0027m REALLY a skeptic... especially in today\u0027s marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don\u0027t buy anything without checking it out first, and even then, I expect that it\u0027s probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah, wonderful view there, huh?\n\nWell, needless to say, I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn\u0027t fail me out of the box. I\u0027ve been using my speedpad for almost a year now, and I have to say that it has been by far more solid, responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that\u0027s how well this gamepad has worked for me.\n\nHere are the ins and outs:\n\n1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I\u0027m glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.\n\n2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don\u0027t bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin\u0027s website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what\u0027s on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you\u0027ll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\n\nI\u0027ve had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that\u0027s generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin\u0027s programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\n\n4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I\u0027ve never had it happen since. \n\n5) Other buttons. \n* The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don\u0027t use it much at all because it\u0027s hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \n* The orange button above the d-pad also isn\u0027t that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it\u0027s not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It\u0027s perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\n* I haven\u0027t experienced any problems hitting the \u0027space\u0027 button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can\u0027t simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that\u0027s not much of a complaint at all, really.\n\nThe d-pad itself is a godsend! I\u0027m a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that\u0027s kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I\u0027ve never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. \n\nAs I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven\u0027t and that I really needed - a controller interface that\u0027s actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I\u0027m using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I\u0027m playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn\u0027t it? \n\nThe Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who\u0027s looking for the type of benefits I\u0027ve listed. And, for that matter, I\u0027m recommending it right now in fact...\n",

Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case.  Once you\u0027re done, however, it\u0027s very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won\u0027t provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).  The leather feels surprisingly good, almost a lambskin kind of quality.  The credit card space is not very useful, but you can shove a couple of business cards in there.

The main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger, with a couple walls in between, and I have no problems with signal.\n\nThe handsets are smaller than I expected, but that\u0027s actually a bonus since I hadn\u0027t bought a new phone in a while and thought my old handset was too big and clunky.  The handsets are about 6 inches long not including the antenna part, 1 and 7/8 inches at the widest point by the display, and 1 and 1/8 inches thick at the thickest point.\n\nDoesn\u0027t interfere with my wireless internet or any of my other electronics.  I\u0027ve used the phone while sitting next to my laptop, while both I and the chargers were next to TV and stereos, and with my cell phone going at the same time - no interference.\n\nThe speakerphone part isn\u0027t that great - the person on the other end can hear other sounds in the room, plus they say it sounds like I\u0027m speaking from a great distance away.  But I\u0027ve never had a phone with a good speakerphone, so wasn\u0027t expecting that to work anyway.\n\nWould have been great if they\u0027d included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks.  I love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet - solved my lack of working jacks problem!!\n\nThe display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys.  The keys are not backlit.  The menus are fairly intuitive - if you\u0027ve ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily.  It\u0027s very easy to send phone numbers that you\u0027ve programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset.\n\nWhen I first hooked everything up, the phones got no dial tone, but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall.  For some reason, the cord they provided didn\u0027t work, so when I swapped it out with the cord I had, all the phones worked fine.\n\nI\u0027d buy these again and recommend to others to buy\n",

The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don\u0027t like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can\u0027t live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I\u0027ve used it for gaming as well, though I admit I\u0027m not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse.

I\u0027ll admit \"NROUTE\" took a little getting used to (for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you\u0027re not going to find it) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie.  Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations.  A great buy for only 100 bucks!

    "\nObviously, there are far better printers on the market.  But if you\u0027re looking for a quality 3-in-one in the $100 to $150 range, this one seems to be at the top of the pack.\n\nThere are nicer printers out there in this price range.  However, you will be severely penalized when it comes to purchasing ink.  Hewlett-Packard printers tend to be the most friendly when it comes to buying refilled cartridges or refilling your own cartridges.\n\nIt prints fast, it prints well, and I enjoy the double-sided printing feature.  This printer has been consistently rated by users as being accurate in its color prints, although I\u0027ve done little color printing myself.\n\nThe scans are not the greatest as they leave small artifacts at regular intervals when you zoom in in Photoshop.  The artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels.  They\u0027re not really noticeable to the naked eye and you won\u0027t see them unless you\u0027re editing the picture and have blown it up considerably.  Still, it\u0027s probably not the best for archiving your photos. (I expect there\u0027s a bur on the plastic gear that rolls down the rack \u0026 pinion)\n\nHowever, flaws are to be expected in this price range and the listed flaws of this printer are nominal.  \n\nGiven my research two months ago, and performance I\u0027ve encountered after purchasing this printer, and the ease with which I was able to refill the ink cartridges; I\u0027d say this is the best printer you can buy for $100,(as of Nov 2006) if you don\u0027t want to be extorted into paying exorbitant ink prices, for say, an Epson\n",

    "\nI have the Canon MP500 printer and Canon Rebel XT camera - both capable of producing amazing results, but paper makes a HUUUUGE diference in photo printing. I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos, then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy, you\u0027re definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy, and the print is significantly better than the original. \n\nPros: Best Value Canon has to offer. Great, great prints, my favorite paper overall. As good as Pro, and less expensive.  About 55 cents per page in a 30 page pack of Pro compared to 40 cents per page in a 20 page pack of Plus.\n\nCons: None at all so far.  have not seen if photos last over time\n",

There may be a benifit to the \u0026quot;Pro\u0026quot; paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)\n",

After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn\u0027t a real concern. \n\nI must say, overall, I am quite pleased. While I am new to frying, I found it extraordinarily easy (it is pretty hot though, so be careful).  Only complaint would be that the capacity is a  little on the small side, say if you\u0027re cooking entrees for a larger family (for example, you can really only fit 3 (MAYBE 4) pieces of chicken at a time).  But since the chicken needs to cool down anyway, this wasn\u0027t such a major issue.  It came out nice, crispy, and golden brown - not too soggy, not too crisp - perfect.  \n\nI figure if it can handle the chicken, vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake.

The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl.\n\nA number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally, a way to keep everything together).

I never lost interest, however, in studying tic-tac-toe and similar games, which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory, and partly accounts for my joining Chi Omicron Chi as a college freshman.  As part of our initiation, pledges had to play a modified form of tic-tac-toe with vodka-filled shot glasses for markers.  Each player had five glasses, and as he placed his marker, he would empty his glass.  The loser would drink the remaining shot glasses.  Most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic-tac-toe, so really the point of the game, as with most fraternity games, was to see who could best hold his liquor.  I do remember one unfortunate pledge, Bob, who never figured out how to play perfect tic-tac-toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia.\n\nAll these thoughts came rushing, so to speak, back to me when I saw the \"Shot Glasses Tic-Tac-Toe\" available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component.  I have a four-year-old son who has yet to perfect his tic-tac-toe game, so I bought this set to educate him.  We play the same way I did in the Xocks fraternity house.  Of course I don\u0027t give him pure vodka in his shot glasses; he only weighs 35 lbs.  As 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight, I dilute his vodka in a 1-to-4 dilution with orange juice.  I know what you\u0027re thinking: what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses, including mine?  I am nothing if not fair, so when he loses, I give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka I have remaining in my shot glasses.  Since I, knowing how to play perfect tic-tac-toe, never lose to my son, the reverse problem, my having to drink his remaining shots, never occurs.\n\nMy son loses more often than not, and he usually ends up walking into walls, falling down, and later becoming violently sick.  You would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic-tac-toe, but his cognitive development must be lacking.  I can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic-tac-toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections.  He still loves to play, however, but his game, if anything, seems to be getting worse, almost as if he is trying to lose\n",

    "\nThis is my third pair of kitchen shears.  The first was $10 and lasted a week.  I thought the second pair was just fine until my Shun shears arrived.  These cut well and are also very smooth while cutting.  They fit my hand nicely. I can really feel the difference in quality.  These can perform different functions -- opening bottles, jar opener, nut cracker -- one blade has a curve in it to accomodate bone.  I love that they are dishwasher safe.\n\nI probably wouldn\u0027t have purchashed these if I were not completing a Shun set.  But now that I have them, this is what I should have been using all along\n",

    "\nThis knife is well worth the money.  It is not only sharp but it behaves in your hand begging to be tuned loose on meat vegetables, fruit you name it.  Honestly, I felt it was too much for me but as I got better accustomed to its heft, I knew it was me that did not possess the skills to wield the tool.   Do not doubt yourself, learning to use it is a joy.  Treat yourself\n",

    "\nI made plenty of pizzas on several types of thin metal baking pans, and the results were consistenly mediocre.\n\nNow however, with this pizza stone, I no long find myself ordering pizza for delivery.\n\n1 cup water or beer\n2 1/2 cups flour (maybe a 1/4-cup of whole-wheat flour mixed in)\n1 package of dry yeast\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon sugar\n1 tablespoon butter\n\nKnead and let rise twice (I used to do it by hand, but now I have a bread maker which works perfectly for this purpose on the \u0027dough\u0027 setting).  This makes two pizzas around 14 inches in diameter.  Either roll them out with a rolling pin, or press them into shape by hand.  The dough seems to be too elastic to \"throw\" it into shape - I think it\u0027s a skill that takes a long while to master.\n\nI make pizza sauce with a can of tomato paste, some red wine and/or water, chopped parsley, chopped basil, dried oregano, chopped garlic and chopped onion.  I\u0027ve also used pasta sauce (prego or ragu) with acceptable results.\n\nI almost always top with mozarella and thinly-sliced mushrooms.\n\nI use parchment baking paper under the pizza.  I slide it on and off the stone this way, without resorting to corn meal.  This works perfectly for me every time.\n\nHeat the oven up _HOT_ (500 degrees).  It will only take 5 minutes to bake at this temperature.  When the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges, it is done.  The crust is golden-brown on the bottom, with just a bit of crunch.  If I let the crust rise a bit after preparing the pizza, it will be softer and thicker.\n\nStore-bought frozen pizzas are also better when cooked on this stone.\n\nI\u0027m giving only 4 stars because of the price.  There must be a cheaper alternative to this stone, but I\u0027m not complaining too much, because I\u0027ve thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas it\u0027s produced\n",
    "\nI had never used a pizza stone but, thought they might be fun so, I put one on my registry. I made pizza on the stone using store bought dough and got rave reviews from friends. Would definately reccomend this to a friend! Just remember to let the stone heat thoroughly before using.\n",

I sent an email and they said they will send me one (they seem to have a good customer service).\n\nNow that we have dispensed with the whining, lets talk about the product itself.  If you need sharp lines on your pants or shirt stick with your iron, this is not for you.  However if you would like to take wrinkles out of your clothes and you don\u0027t want to bother with hanging them in the bathroom while you take a shower or taking them out of the dryer on time, this does do an amazing job.\n\nI have also purchased a JIFFY personal hand held steamer that works fairly well and provides adequate amount of steam for most of your needs.  However if you take wrinkles out frequently and have the space go for J-4000.  You get the wrinkles out faster.\n\nIf you have a concern about startup time, you do have some control over that.  I just put enough cold water in there for a few shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes.  If you put hot water out of the tab and reduce the amount of water you can get even quicker startup time.  Or you can put it on standby in the morning before you go to the shower and put it on steam when you are ready to use it.  Standby setting uses a thermostat to keeps the water temperature at 90C degrees (close to boiling).  \n\nIf you can afford it, buy one.  It would make a great re-gift item if you find out that you don\u0027t like it\n",
    "\n\nI absolutely love my KitchenAid mixer.  I like to bake and always use my mixer.  I use it to mix cake batters and knead dough.  Cakes come out perfect every time.  The mixer is a necessity for every baker\u0027s kitchen.  It is a durable product and will last a lifetime.  The mixer is well built and well designed.  Cleanup is easy too.  Just remove the bowl and beater and wash by hand or in the dishwasher.  The mixer comes with one bowl, kneading hook, flat paddle beater and whisk-type beater.  There are also many accessories available for the KitchenAid mixers.  \n\nI recommend the KitchenAid mixer for every kitchen.  The more you use it, the more you will love it.\n",

    "\nI have used this filter daily for over a year and love it. At first I tried using it in a \"Mr. Coffee\" style machine, but found that my coffee grind was too fine and the water would filter through too slowly and overflow if I made more than 2 cups. \n\nSince I make coffee for one or two people usually, and don\u0027t like to leave the coffee on the hot pad, so this was okay for me.\n\nThen I switched to single-cup method using a drip filter holder that fits over the cup. I bought it along with a cup at a Starbucks about 3 years ago.\n\nOne thing that is great about the SwissGold filter is that it cleans so easily. The first time I rinsed it out I took a paper towel to the inside and it came out clean. I was very surprised. (Not so with the plastic filter holder.) \n\nThe taste is great, and I haven\u0027t purchased coffee filters in 3 years. Once I tried it with a coarse grind coffee in my coffemaker, which I received as a gift, and that worked out okay, too.\n\nCurrently I am using it with my caffiene free Teeccino herbal coffees (help me keep my blood pressure normal under stress), and the filter works very well with those blends.\n\nSo I highly recommend it. It pays for itself if you are looking at it from that aspect.\n",
    "\nMe being an avid coffee drinker I will have to say if you want a quick cup it does the job.  For the money its cheap and provides a quick cup but you better have good coffee I used the pods and found it to be weak at time and sometimes you need a stronger cup I think more brewing is better.  Sometimes was a bit messy water all over the place but maybe Im a bull in a china shop would recommend the item I spent more on starbucks in a week\n",
    "\nThis may sound odd, but this is the first steamer that I have ever had. So needless to say, I do not have others to compare it to. However,I find that I use it more than I thought I would! The unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that I most use for vegies and the like, and when I pull out the sides (the steaming tray) it fits nicely up the sides of the pot. Besides your basic steamed vegies, I find that it\u0027s perfect for warming up leftovers like rice, leaving it hot and fluffy. I like that the handle extends, so you can keep the cover on it while cooking, but you can extend the handle for easier lifting. And you can\u0027t beat the price\n",
    "\nSo I read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this AND was skeptical. There were many reviewers that complained about cracks and problems holding an air-tight seal. MINE WORK PERFECTLY! They are invaluable and I\u0027m glad I bought two of these canisters. Are you people sending the canisters through the dishwasher? If so, stop it! The intense heat will eventually crack anything made of plastic. Do you have an OLD model vacuum sealer? Maybe that\u0027s the problem - a performance issue. I have the newer stainless steel V2860 and you couldn\u0027t pry that out of my hands! I would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating.\n\nToday, I give this product 5 stars. Like most products - only time will tell how well they will hold out in the long run\n",
    "\nAt first I thought I wouldn\u0027t be able to decide what to use this for, but right away I remembered that I just bought a six pack of onion rolls and they always seemed to have to be frozen and were just not the same later or went moldy in the fridge, so I vacuum sealed them in this and they were good to the last one with no flavor change at all.  Yummy! ;7\n",
    "\nI love this wok.  Heavy duty compared to woks you buy at oriental stores.  I highly recommend it\n",
    "\nAt first I was turned off by the bright (gaudy) colors.  However, I have learned to appreciate that these knives are color-coded! They stand out in the knife drawer, and you can always find the one you are looking for.  Consequently, the right knife is used to get the job done.\nThe knives are indestructable and durable.  We have owned ours 4-5 years and they show no unusual wear. Put them into the dishwasher!  We don\u0027t do that with another knife (regretted it when we have), but these can take it. The knives are well-designed for function, comfortable to handle, strong, \u0026 sharp.\nWe love them and gave sets to our adult kids who always are commenting on how useful they are. Friends that visit and use ours comment favorably on them.\nThese aren\u0027t showy knives for formal dining nor will they impress anyone with your classy style.  However, they do impress everyone who uses them.  And, the price is nice\n",
    "\nI have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier.  They have excellent balance and feel.  A major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the Calphalon 15 piece set.  The wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice (light pine with no finish), but I don\u0027t use it anyway\n",
    "\nDelighted to have it for my wood floors, tile and area rugs. Works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non-organic detritus that collects. Does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly - gosh darn! So much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house. Also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down, when I want to change areas being cleaned. Again, gosh darn! Can\u0027t totally eliminate ALL the work, no matter how much I might like to.\n\nDon\u0027t know what was wrong with it initially that it needed to be reconditioned, but its fine now\n",
    "\nThis Dutch Oven is a workhorse in my kitchen.  I purchased it pre-seasoned because I\u0027ve never had a factory-seasoned piece of cast iron cookware.  Bottom line:  While the pre-seasoning was a plus, it\u0027s not necessary.  Just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the Lodge cookware, and you\u0027ll be fine.\n\nMy family has had cast iron for generations, and I won\u0027t pay the exhorbitant prices for those \"upscale, professional\" dutch ovens that are all the rage these days.  This Lodge oven browns spectacularly, and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one, that\u0027s not a problem if one simply uses one\u0027s nose.  We can all tell when enough is enough...   \n\nI particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which aren\u0027t present on the more expensive ones.  These spikes allow condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and I don\u0027t have to worry about a dry product.  The lid on this oven also fits the 12-inch skillet which I own, and that\u0027s a plus.  It conducts heat well and when I use it camping as an oven, breads and biscuits come out as well as at home.  \n\nYes, it\u0027s heavy, but that\u0027s the nature of cast iron, no??  If you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this Lodge piece, be prepared to shell out big bucks\n",
    "\nThis is the second one of these I\u0027ve purchased (the first was a Thermos branded one without the cover).

Absolutely the most functional, effective, and classy cooler I\u0027ve ever had!\n",
    "\nThe Nissan Multi-Function Can Insulator is a lightweight versatile stainless steel holder that effectively keeps canned beverages cold.

My original set was also by Sango, and I gave it away after 20 years only because my decor had changed dramactically.  Now my neighbor is enjoying my original service for 12.

    "\nWhen we got married 7 years ago, we were given a hand mixer of another brand (Sunbeam, I think) that had seven (or was it nine?) speeds and lots of different attachments (dough hook, wisk, etc., none of wich worked well).  I have a hard time remembering exact spefications because it died after 6 months, and I hadn\u0027t even mixed anything heavy with it!  I always mixed most of my flour into things by hand to try to spare the motor (my mom had burnt through several mixers).\nSo we went to the store, and for $30 we could get another cheap brand with many speeds and fancy gadgets (several brands \u0026 models available), or we could get this Kitchenaid with one set of beaters and three speeds.  I chose this simple Kitchaid and have never been sorry.\nThis little hand mixer takes it all--even stiff cookie dough like roll-out sugar cookies.  And it mixes every last bit of the flour in.  Beaters don\u0027t clog, dough mixes up smooth.\nI plan on someday getting a bigger kitchenaid, but so far haven\u0027t needed it.  If you are on a budget, and need to get the most power for your penny, this is the best purchase you could possibly make\n",
    "\nI have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually haven\u0027t gotten another for the past 6 years. I\u0027ve resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase. Finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster. It\u0027s so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting. Worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but I\u0027m sure Braun is cringing if they read this! I love the little pull out tray, you don\u0027t have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death! The toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time. Slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem. It is fast too, so you won\u0027t miss it not being a 4 slice toaster. I think you will be pleased with this great toaster, I am\n",
    "\nThe Braun HT500 is one of the best designed toasters I have ever used. What I really like....\n\n1. A single long \u0026 wide slot, allowing you to toast large or unusually shaped pieces of bread. I have used it to toast very thick pieces of bread, long hoagee rolls, and those huge hamberger buns that won\u0027t fit in a standard toaster slot.\n\n2. Very clean, modern appearance.  Looks great sitting on the kitchen counter, whereas many of the other toaster models today look like ugly chrome spaceships from the 1950\u0027s.  Personally, I\u0027m not into that kind of retro look.\n\n3. An led light that is clearly visible when the toaster is \"on\", allowing you to quickly see the status of your toast from the other side of the room.\n\n4. When the toast is done, it pops-up only part way. This helps keep your toast warm prior to you extracting it. You then pull the lever up a notch higher and it raises the toast up very high, making it easy to pull-out even very small pieces of bread.\n\n5. It toasts evenly.  Of course, you would expect this.  But you\u0027d be surprised how some very expensive toasters I\u0027ve used in the past were often poor in this area.\n\nOf all those items, the first one is by far the most important. Strangely however, few manufacturers today make a long \u0026 wide toaster any longer.  Braun is one of the few that does.  That fact combined with the great design is reason for me to give it a hearty recommendation\n",
    "\nGreat blender! I use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails. Powerful motor purees frozen fruits great!! Simple--only two speeds. Easy clean-up\n",
    "\nI have only used this blender once, but already I love it.  I will update my review if anything changes.  No more cheapo blenders for me!  I have tried Oster (really bad), and Black and Decker from Walmart (a tad better, but it didn\u0027t work on frozen fruit and ice).\n\nFirst, with the Waring, I made a frozen Island Oasis mix using ice, and the consistency was amazing.  \n\nSecond, since I\u0027m single, I absolutely love the small size (I think it\u0027s like 24 oz or so).\n\nThird, it\u0027s not really that loud.  I mean no louder than any other blender I\u0027ve used.\n\nFourth, there are no cheap plastic parts!  Yay!  Only high quality parts. The jar is stainless steel. If the two top pieces are plastic or polycarbanate(?), they are of very high quality.  \n\nFifth, the blades are built into the stainless steel container, and it\u0027s a snap to clean.  Just add a cup of water, a few drops of cleaning liquid, run the blender for 30 seconds or so, rinse, dry and you\u0027re done!  Cuts my cleaning time down considerably. Moreover, there\u0027s no unscrewing and cheap plastic round things that always tear.  There is absolutely no way that you would have problems with a leaking jar.\n\nLast, I didn\u0027t have any problems with a burning smell.  I am sticking with Waring products.

    "\nI love this pan.  As for cooking: This pan does a great job on steaks, burgers, chicken, whatever. Leaves really nice grill marks. The only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it.  I use a 16\" round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range.  This seems to work just find for me.\n\nAs for Cleaning:  I let it cool a little after cooking and pour some water (no soap!) into the bottom of the pan while it is just hot enough for the water to boil a little, and using a wooden spatula (only use wood in this pan), I scrape all the fond away (burnt tasty bits stuck to the pan) and pour into the sink.  I repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel.  I then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm. Takes about 2 minutes to do this.  I store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time. This pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since I live in an apartment and don\u0027t have access to a grill\n",

    "\nI did not find a problem with the balance, as previously mentioned by another reviewer. The only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is, that if they are planning on tossing their food, they had better be strong because this unit is heavy! Other than that, it proves to be very useful for large portions. It heats quickly, heats evenly, holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir. Yes, it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides. The purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well. Now keep in mind, there isnt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top, flat top or coil range. True frying ala Asian style is done on an open flame! \n",

    "\nLe Creuset\u0027s grills, woks, and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be \"Seasoned\" like tradiitonal cast iron. There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this. Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan, the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes. Let the pan cool, remove the oil with a paper towel, and repeat two or three times. A surface \"patina\" builds up that is quite non-stick. From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel. In the case of burned-on food, a brief soak in soapy water works well. As the pan is used the patina continues to build.  Le Creuset\u0027s omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick.  The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating.  I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan, and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating. This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations. The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats, stir fries, and other hardier preparations.  If you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems.\n",

I\u0027ve had it for three years now and it\u0027s still working great.   \n\nI use it for everything, now.  My husband doesn\u0027t like veggies, and I when I cook I usually put onion, celery, and bell pepper in everything.  Now we get the taste of my beloved vegtables, and he doesn\u0027t have to deal with the chunks.  Great product! \n",
    "\nHeads and tails above my 8 year old Hoover wind-tunnel bagged unit. Never did understand the 8 bucks for 3 bags. Hoover should have given the vacuum away due to always having to replace bags every week (adds up to big bucks quickly).\n\nThe Dyson kicks butt... Three times the dirt is picked up every week when compared to Hoover bag replacement size of dirt removed.\n\nWish the Dyson had self propelled system... The house keeper wouldn\u0027t be so tired after 3 hours ;o) Handy hose and a really well thought out system. \n\nHands down the best unit I\u0027ve ever owned. Time will tell if it holds up like the hoover unit did. Won\u0027t miss the belt replacements (2) or the bag cost on the Hoover.\n\nWould I buy another? If it holds up like my Hoover did... You bet... Like I stated before: Kicks butt at picking up dog fur-!\n",
    "\nI received this tea kettle as a replacement for a Nova teakettle (the former model) that I purchased in October 2005.\n\nPart of the quality of a product is how the company stands behind it, and Breville is excellent in this area.  My former kettle developed a short in the on/off switch.  I notified the company by email, and I received an email response in 3 hours asking some questions and for more detail.  In 3 more hours, I received an email with a fed-x label.  They indicated they wanted to see the product, and they would either repair or replace it.  Within a week, I had this new model as a replacement, since they no longer make the Nova.\n\nI then received a follow up phone call from Breville to make sure I got and liked the new product, which I do.  The warranty period for the new product starts again, so it has a full one year warranty.  I also asked about the switch, since I was concerned that this could be a problem, and they assured me that this is a problem they just don\u0027t have with the applicances.  The customer service rep indicated that in 10 years, he had seen about 6 of the type of problem I had.  It seems that a customer service rep that has worked for a company for 10 years also says something about the company.\n\nThe new kettle heats quickly and to a full boil.  It also has the sharp looks where you can use for entertaining.  I am happy with the product, and very happy with the company\u0027s service\n",
    "\nThis electric water heater feels very solid and well built. When filled to 1.7 liters, it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil. The kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished. I thought this would be annoying, but it is not! Also, when switched on, there is a nice white LED lighting up the water supply making it easy to read.\n\nMy only complaint about this kettle is that it is rather loud (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) when it is on. A few moments after the switch is turned on, it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation\n",
    "\nI love this fryer! Its just the right size for my kitchen.Its not big and bulky like other fryers. Its easy to clean too. Its a winner in my book\n",

    "\nI ordered this item when it was not available at that time so it took a while for me to get it-but I was impressed at the careful packing and the product itself-very elegant looking cake set and can be used as a punch bowl too-would certainly recommend it for all hosts\n",
    "\nI recieved this cake plate a couple weeks ago. it\u0027s very heavy and well made. it came boxed extra well. The box was inside another box surrounded by air bags.  There was no way this thing was going to be broken. I am happy with my purchase\n",
    "\nLodge logic has exploded from a small corner shop in one lonely town in Vermont, to a nationwide powerhouse ready and eager to bust down to the door to your house and fill your kitchen with finest in waffle press technology.

    "\nPyrex is always the best!  This enormous measuring cup is great for melting in the microwave and for a homemade double boiler in any pot.  The lid is a hard plastic top with flexible sides that seal up tight so you can use it to store things in the fridge and to carry things places.  Also the cover is safe for both freezer and microwave use (but not the oven) and is dishwasher safe in the top rack.  The cover has three pouring choices, a regular pour spout, a slotted spout, and a spout with seven little holes.  An extremely useful item to have in the kitchen\n",

    "\nOk, this is obviously not the same as the traditional All Clad stockpots, if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one. It is part of the disk bottom collection, however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made. I certainly would not consider it secondary. It is a little lighter in weight than the traditional All Clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means. It is great for sauce, soup, stew, etc. You will love it and you can\u0027t beat the price. It is very easy to clean. A+ \nKeep an eye out, there is always some kind of rebate or gift with most cooking purchases both on Amazon and in department and cooking stores.  I actually got this stock pot free when I purchased my All-Clad Roti Pan set which also came with a rack and turkey lifters in Filene\u0027s.  I would have bought it anyway, it is an excellent stockpot and the price can\u0027t be beat.  \nTip: If you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called \"Bar Keepers Friend\" to clean it. Most supermarkets have it and Kitchen Etc. and Bed, Bath and Beyond carry it too. The container (like a Comet can) is gold with blue and white writing. All Clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive. \n",

    "\nFiestaware ROCKS.  A few years back, I started my Fiestaware collection. The butter dish, in turquoise, was a recent addition.  I like the vibrant colors available which allow for a cheerful, eclectic mix or a more coordinated theme. It is of the highest quality and very durable in the oven as well.  I am going to put glass doors on my cabinets to showcase my Fiestaware because not only is it practical and beautiful, they are individual pieces of art! \n",
    "\nThis grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen. It\u0027s very solidly built, unlike the old ones I have, and the non-skid base is pure genius. The grating surface is nice and sharp. I love the container that catches whatever you\u0027ve grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid. Although the container faithfully catches the grated material, there will be some spillage - from the outside of the grater - especially with cheese. One caveat: Since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use, you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating. Yup, I realized this the hard way, and boy was it a mess! Despite this, I highly recommend this kitchen essential\n",

    "\nThis knife works nicely. The blades have remained sharp after carving roasted chicken and turkey, roast beef, and yes even cakes over the past year.\n\nThe handle wipes off cleanly after use and doesn\u0027t suffer from the  extreme electric motor vibration that so many electric knives have. The handle stays cool as well. I don\u0027t have anything bad to say about this item, it has been a true performer\n",
    "\nThis is a very nice set of small measuring spoons-- excellent for measuring baking soda, salt, etc for recipes. They are very sturdy and much better than the inexpensive plastic products you find at the discount stores.

I really like this set and would recommend this to everyone\n",

    "\nHad I known what a difference this would make with my cooking, I would have bought one a long time ago. Everything is faster, now, and everything I mix, from potatoes to icing, comes out smoother, too. \nThere are a variety of things you can make with this mixer, and I use mine a lot. Perhaps not every single day, but almost. I bake bread with it every few days, and I decorate cakes for parties and special occasions on the side. My mixer has never let me down. In fact, I am buying an extra bowl just for convenience, too. \nSometimes you do get a strange smell when you use it to whip something up. They even tell you in your mixer\u0027s manual to expect it and that it is normal. \nI\u0027ve had mine for almost a year, now, and was waiting until I had it awhile before I reviewed it. But I have yet to have any problems with it. \nIt\u0027s cut preparation time more than half for everything I\u0027ve made with it. From cakes to meatloaf and bread. It\u0027s sturdy and somewhat heavy, which means it\u0027s not going to easily be knocked off your counter. \nIt does have a slow start to prevent flour from going all over. However, if you are using a lot of powdered sugar or flour to the point of it being more than half full, you will still want to use the stir speed until it\u0027s a little more settled and moist or you will end up with a mess. Not a big one, but a mess nonetheless. \nIt comes with a book of recipes, but I\u0027ve only used a few. I\u0027ve never had any issues with it handling all the cookie dough and other heavy doughs I\u0027ve mixed with it, however. In fact, I\u0027ve made more cookies just since getting this than I did for years before. It\u0027s just so convenient and easy that I don\u0027t mind. I mean heavy doughs, too, like monster cookies and peanut butter m\u0026m cookies, etc. \nI don\u0027t know what else to say about it. I don\u0027t think you will be disappointed in this purchase. I\u0027m usually someone who doesn\u0027t like to spend a lot of money, but this was more than worth it, and I will be buying my daughter one someday, too\n",
    "\nThe KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they\u0027d exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. \n\nAt this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer\n",

The soft silicone head easily contours itself to the bottom of the bowl  to get every last bit.  It\u0027s also incredibly stick free.  I made fondue last night and after pouring it all into the serving dish, I wiped the cheese off the spoon with a finger, rinsed it, and it was clean!  It is also incredibly heat resistent.  My household has a lot of spatulas with burn marks all along the handle from resting on the side of a pot on the stove.  I\u0027ve had this spatula for over two years and it\u0027s still burn free.  I love it\n",

I went without curtains over our kitchen doorway for years and always felt that something was missing.  These magnetic curtain rods solved that problem.  The rod holders attach magnetically without screws or bolts.  The holders have never shifted out of place and have not scuffed or scratched my door.  The curtain rods are stable enough to hold heavy canvas curtains. I installed the set in a moment\u0027s time with very little effort.

    "\nThis is probably the most used tool in my kitchen. The cost of the machine and bag material are more than repaid in food savings. I like the rolls as opposed to the bags because I can make the size I need without waste. Watch for sales on meat or fish; buy large quantities at reduced cost, and cut your bags to a portion size, vacuum and seal, and freeze. I have taken hamburger, steaks, fish, pork, and chicken out of the freezer after being stored for two years or longer, and they are as fresh as the day I put them in\n",
    "\nI got this pan set a few years ago.  I love making checkerboard cakes--they are so simple with this set.  You can use boxed mixes, but I find the thicker consistency of the sample recipe makes a more distinct checkerboard design.  \n\nMy favourite variation is to make blue and pink for baby showers instead of brown and white. (I make the white cake and just use  food colouring). \n",

Well, at least these are serving a purpose, and are reusable....I don\u0027t have to scoop anymore, and I have 2 cats, I change it maybe every 3rd day, and it\u0027s not a chore, takes less than a minute, less time than scooping and smelling it as it sits there,  and speaking of, I do not smell their poop at all till it\u0027s changed. so I\u0027m happy and I think it\u0027s more than worth it!\n",

Preparing salsa, omlettes, indian food which requires vegetables chopped into small pieces, pancakes and numerous other tasks have become so easy that we make more vegetarian dishes now and they taste better since the pieces are well and evenly chopped.\nReally enjoyed the blender during the summer months when we made fresh juices etc. Unlike the old kenmore one this one blends much better.\n\nI recommend this to any one who does not want to spend money on an expensive food processor or does not have the counter space in the kitchen for all the apparatus that comes with a big food processor.\n\n",
    "\nThis is a jewel. Takes the skin off nice and clean. Just the tool to get rid of those tough skins on a few tomatoes and no more fuzzy peaches. Just bought 6 more for family and friends.\n",
    "\nThis is a great shredder.  Absolutly the best out there.  It is a lousy slicer.  Take the bad with the good I guess.\n\nMy wife and I shred lots of cheese because pre-shredded cheese has chemicals added that change the taste and chemical properties of the cheese.   This attachment works wonderfully for cheese.   \n\nA note on disassembly.  Some people have difficulty getting the cone off the plug (if you own one you know what I\u0027m talking about).   The very easy way to remedy this is to remove the cone from the plug before removing the plug from the machine.  If you follow this one rule you will have very easy setup and take down.  \n\n\n",
    "\nFirst, the good stuff: this peeler is sharp, requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable. I like having it, but I\u0027m also holding on to my cheap little Oxo peeler for a couple of reasons: first, the Rosle produces very thick peels, which is a bit wasteful. Second, I tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me. The Rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right-handed and left-handed peeler. That said, I do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction, which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models\n",
    "\nLe Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. \n\nCast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat. Due to this efficiency, it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat.  Over heating may cause foods to stick to the pan, or worse burn and can cause the enamel to appear stained.  Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. The opposite holds true as well, chill the pan and it will retain its chill for a surprisingly long time.  Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials. \n\nCast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn\u0027t add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit contact to heat resistant plastic or wood utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain. \n\nThe benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the French oven, Cocotte or as it\u0027s also referred to, the Dutch oven specifically.  French ovens have been manufactured by Le Creuset for over 75 years, and were developed well before then.  In all this time the design has stayed constant, affirming the relevance of its cooking qualities.  These ovens come in either oval or round shapes.  The oval shape works well for roasting whole chickens and porkloin roasts, otherwise the differences are minimal.\n\nThis pan holds 6 3/4 quarts of food, measures 9 1/2 x 12 inches or 24 x 30 cm internal diameter, 4 3/4 inch or 11 1/2 cm deep, and weighs 13 pounds.  The domed lid provides a tight seal, trapping in moisture to roll back into the dish.  The lid may alternatively be used as a holding plate for chopped vegetables or meat during initial preparations.  Be sure to lift the pan off of cooking surfaces to reduce damaging either the pan or the surface.  French oven tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot. \n \nFrench ovens were developed for slow cooking by stewing, braising or boiling.  Some typical dishes include roasts, and stews.  Other possibilities include gumbos, chili, dirty rice, baked beans, Swedish meatballs, osso bucco, or curing ice cream to name a few.\n\nOne feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn\u0027t seem like it should be expensive when comparing to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. \n\nPROS: \nEfficient absorption and distribution of heat \nHygienic enamel cooking surface \nDoes not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors \nCleans easily when not abused or misused \nCan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table \nEasily lasts a lifetime \n\nCONS: \nIts heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 13 pound\n",
    "\nThis pot rocks.  You\u0027ll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it.  It browns well, cleans easily, and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style. \n\nMy only complaint is that mine arrived slightly chipped, but the chips don\u0027t seem to affect its performance, so I didn\u0027t send it back\n",
    "\nThis product is great for making mashed potatoes.  I love it, it is well made and sturdy.  My kids like to turn the handle and I do not have to worry about any electric blades cutting their fingers.  The price is very good for this item. I prefer non electric kitchen gadgets, (to save space) and this one is great.\n",
    "\nI used the four large slider discs to move an 8\u0027 x 10\u0027 gambrel roofed framed shed a few feet on a cement pad (after building the mini-barn \u0026 painting it).  The move placed it against the fence.  It wasn\u0027t easy, but they did the job and......the slider discs are still useable though scratched up\n",
    "\nI like the amazon customer service as they replaced my order when I got the damaged one\n",
    "\nLe Creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron Chinese-styled wok.  It looks like a Chinese wok, and it is made of iron, but essentially it is not Chinese.\n\nThe wok is much thicker than a Chinese iron wok, and therefore takes much longer time to warm up. Some American users praised the wok by saying it does not need much fire, yet the essence of Chinese stir-frying is cooking through large fire: one heats a thin Chinese carbon iron wok with large fire, puts in vegetable or animal oil, and then does the entire stir frying in less than a few minutes.\n\nStill, I liked the wok after purchasing it. The Chinese food here in the US usually is not really Chinese food in essence, but people like it. Why should I be so critial to a French cast iron wok which looks like a Chinese wok? \n",
    "\nI\u0027ve stir fried in this pan quite a few meals, including carmelizing onions with soy sauce. When used with medium heat, cleaning is very easy. Soaking it for a few minutes and then scrubbing with scotch bright for a minute works. I\u0027ve done this also with high heat, it needed more scrubbing but after a few minutes it looked new. \n\nIf you don\u0027t mind the extra scrubbing, as I don\u0027t, you\u0027ll be happy with a healthier alternative to non-stick pans. My experience shows that with a few minutes of scrubbing the advantages of nonstick can be matched even in the worst case scenario.\n\nI\u0027m a bit ambivalent about the size. I cook for myself and thought 9\" would suffice, but I didn\u0027t take into account the fact that I cook for 2-3 days at a time. This pan is a bit too small in that capacity. On the other hand, my stove top is tiny so it fits fine.\n\nThe handle is beautiful and well designed. I have no problem holding the pan even when full in one hand and it\u0027s well insulated. In contrast, I also own the Simply Calphalon sauce pan with a handle that\u0027s barely suitable for the weight. The quality of this pan is evident.\n\nAll in all, a very high quality product that will serve me for years\n",
    "\nRegarding the \"glue\" issue.  The cutting board came to me as described in Lisa Dryer\u0027s review below:  shrink-wrapped in plastic.  However, the product\u0027s label was adhered to the surface of the cutting board with a big glob of what appears to be that clear sticky stuff they use to hold inserts in magazines, etc. .....and it adheres to bamboo, for sure.  I managed to get most of it off, but a thin layer remains.  I figure that \"Goof-Off\" or some other solvent would get rid of it, but I don\u0027t want to put poison on something that\u0027ll be holding my food.\n\nOne solution is to use only one side of the cutting board.  \n\nOtherwise, it appears to be a perfectly fine product\n",
    "\nWe have been using these for several years now.  For refrigerator storage and reheating, we use these containers almost daily.  I remember the lids were a bit stiff at first, but not impossible unless you are over 80.\n\nAfter 5 or 6 times through the dishwasher, they were prefect and remain so.  They nest nicely and they fit in the dishwasher and come out looking good.  The vent is not that exciting a feature, but if it wasn\u0027t there you\u0027d have more microwave clanup. \n\nRegardless, I highly recommend these\n",
    "\nSo far I have made several different ice creams in my new machine.  This is the first I\u0027d ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you don\u0027t.  The machine is very efficient.  You just put the mixture in and it does all the work.  You may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others.  You just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency.  I made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it didn\u0027t thicken and I wasted all of it, so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine.  The machine is a little noisy but I expected that after reading about it, not as bad as I thought it would be though.  Overall, very happy\n",
    "\nIt was the perfect price and the cheapest that i found anywhere and i would recomend it to anyone\n",
    "\nThis color of Fiesta is just gorgeous and a great addition to any collection. My sister-in-law, for whom this was a gift, just loves it and I\u0027d be tempted to buy a set for myself if I didn\u0027t already have a ton of dishes. The Fiesta line are all well made, solid dishes that can be used for all occasions.  If you know someone needing dishes, the Fiesta line is the way to go. These dishes increase in value regularly and add a lovely touch of color to your table\n",
    "\nI looked for somewhere to find these Corelle plates and found them on Amazon.  My favorite dish and plate design should last a while and withstand my abuse\n",
    "\nThis plate, the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate, just so you know. It\u0027s easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes. My aunt has had the Winter Frost White as long as I can remember, and now I am slowly building my own collection. I love them - they are very light and strong. I tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact. The material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds. They are so thin and light that I could probably carry at least 35 of them. This is perfect for your everyday meals. Highly recommended\n",
    "\nThe combination of the great price and incredible durability makes this stuff perfect for just about everyone.  Both I and my parents have been using Corelle dinnerware for over 15 years, and are amazed at how well they hold up\n",
    "\nPretty good product.  We have not changed the batteries yet \u0026 it does get quite a bit of usage.  It\u0027s easy to use \u0026 not an eye-sore in my kitchen.  Very fast shipping!  I would order again\n",
    "\nI recently received this pan as a gift, and have been extremely impressed with it!  The \"infused anodized\" surface performs as advertised, providing a terrific hybrid between regular and non-stick cooking.  I love the 14\" size -- it\u0027s great for those times when I used to have to split things up into more than one 10\" saute pan, as well as for one-pan stovetop-to-oven dishes.\n\nThat said, this is definitely not the right pan for you if you prefer non-stick surfaces.  You will need to use oil, butter, etc. when cooking in this pan, and things will sometimes stick.  Cleanup is very easy, though!\n\nIt is very well-constructed, and I would expect it to last a lifetime\n",
    "\nThis is one of my favorite knives - and I have quite a collection of them, believe me.  It\u0027s sturdy, sharpens easily, and seems to contour to my hand when chopping.  I\u0027m a faster sous chef for myself and others with this knife.  Great price, I might add.  This brand across the board is one of my all-time favorites.  I\u0027ve never been disappointed with a knife I purchased from Victorinox\n",
    "\nThe Food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase. I know I was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it\u0027s an Excellent food processor and worth more than the money. My wife LOVES you know guys waht that means. Also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow. The seller was more than Excellent.\n",
    "\nThis low cost loaf pan does everything you would expect a loaf pan to do. It\u0027s dark color absorbs enough heat to produce desired browning. It also releases cleanly. The protruding lips serve as handles (although if they were a little bigger they\u0027d be easier to grip while wearing oven mitts). All in all, this is an excellent buy for a loaf pan - you should buy two since many recipes call for making two loaves\n",

I purchaced 3 boxes of gallon 32 cnt bags for $32.97 + $9.00 for shipping. Also keep in mind that you can wash and re-use these bags as long as they did not hold any kind of meat and that they have never been boiled.

    "\nOK so I got this set for free, but I would have paid something for it.  The little peeler works fine but the parer isn\u0027t the sharpest knife in my knife block.  I\u0027ve attempted to sharpen it but it doesn\u0027t hold an edge well\n",

    "\nWhat you see is what you get.  It works just fine, there isn\u0027t really much that could go wrong.  The only thing is I should have gotten the larger size.  What they call a cup and what I call a cup didn\u0027t really measure up.  For me it makes two regular mugs\n",
    "\nThis teapot was a good buy all in all.  It\u0027s true about how the leaves container doesn\u0027t stay in a static position... this concerned me at first, but it hasn\u0027t been a problem.  The tea press will slide down over time without leaves in the pot, I put it in the leaves container on an angle and this stops that from happening.  I have never had a problem loosing heat to fast from this pot, contrary to previous reviews.  Yeah, some things could be better quality... but considering the price I\u0027d call it a good buy\n",

Slowly heat four cups of fresh cream in a large pot to just below a simmer (surface will start to shimmer).  In a small pot, melt four ounces of best bittersweet chocolate on lowest heat.  In a large, deep bowl, beat four fresh egg yolks on high speed and gradually add 2/3 cups sugar.  Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolks and sugar.  Mix in 1/2 cup of ground chocolate (Ghiardelli, for example).  Add melted chocolate and return to large pot.  Heat mixture to about 160 degrees, stirring frequently, and cook until it thickens (about fifteen or twenty minutes).  Don\u0027t let it get above 165 degrees, or it might burn.  Remove from heat, cool, and place in refrigerator for at least an hour.  Pour into Musso, turn on machine, and prepare yourself.  Tell only your closest, dearest loved ones\n",

They will definitely bone a chicken all by themselves (but I spare mine a little by using poultry shears to cut heavier bone).Easy to handle. But best of all, they come apart and go back together with extreme ease, yet stay together for use. Contrary to the description, it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart. They are well designed with a slot and protrusion arrangement that allow them to be separated for CLEANING with a single motion and to be rejoined the same way. The cap and screw are only necessary for sharpening. You\u0027ll wonder how you ever got along without them\n",

Its lightweight, very portable and compact. While listed as a coffee maker, it brewed very slowly and not all that well. But as a hot water heater, it served fantastically well. The typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4-5 minutes, so little patience is needed. The device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses.\n\nThere\u0027s an automatic shut off, the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold. It also come with a small spoon. Machine often come on by itself even before you hit the \"on\" button, probably if you hit the button before you plug it in. I would recommended that you have everything set up before hand.\n\nI used this device at work quite a bit and found it to be super handy thanks to the small size. The following products could be considered as tailored made for this device: Lipton Cup a Soup (sheer perfect for this machine), General Food International coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands.

It does however cook things just fine and is not too large for what I need it for\n",
    "\nLe Creuset baking dishes are an investment in good cooking for a lifetime. This 11 1/2-Inch size oval dish is similar in size and shape to a medium-sized au gratin. It is large enough to bake two large fish fillets or four boneless chicken breasts or a casserole. Many times, I double a casserole recipe and put half in this dish and then freeze it for later use. I bring the dish right from the oven to the table for serving, and I find its clean-up is easy afterward\n",
    "\nThe only complaint from the other reviews that I can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control.  I certainly don\u0027t have any trouble getting hot milk.  My taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated, but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as I\u0027ve had in America.\n\nI\u0027ve had my EspressoPro for 3 years and it\u0027s still working well.  When I first bought the machine, it didn\u0027t work, and the Capresso people were wonderful and immediately sent a new machine.  Then there was a mixup over the color (silver vs chrome), and again the Capresso people were wonderful and sent a new machine.  Both times they sent me a machine immediately, with packaging to send my old machine back, so I had a new machine within two days of calling them.\n\nI always use Espressione coffee pods, and filtered water.  That\u0027s just what is most convenient for me.  I\u0027ve never actually cleaned the machine\u0027s innards, and I haven\u0027t noticed any degradation in performance over the years.\n\nThe milk attachment is very convenient.  We wash ours about once a week, although we do have to wash the little siphon/nozzle thing every day.  It\u0027s about as much work as a stainless jug I guess, with the advantage that you\u0027re not wasting milk every time you make a latte.\n\nThe downside to the milk attachment is that I haven\u0027t found a way to get a lot of froth out of it.  It\u0027s got a little knob on top that is supposed to control the amount of froth.  It does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk, but no matter what I do, I almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte.  Occasionally I end up with a lot more or almost none, but I have no idea why.  That\u0027s my biggest complaint.\n\nThe bit where the coffee comes out into your cup (you can see my level of sophistication there) has two holes, so it can pour into two cups at once.  This is worthless.  The coffee never comes out evenly, and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway.  The end result of the two holes is that whenever I make an espresso, some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in.  It\u0027s also a bit short for any latte glass I\u0027ve ever found, and you have to tilt the glass to get it under.\n\nDespite the fact that the EspressoPro doesn\u0027t look particularly tough (it\u0027s mostly plastic, and not really heavy plastic at that), Mine is still going strong after three years.  Much to the dismay of my grandparents, three years is considered long enough to classify something as \"durable\" thesedays.\n\nSo there you go.  I\u0027m sure there are machines that make better espresso, but for convenience, I haven\u0027t seen any machines that can touch this one for less than twice the price.  There are a couple of things I\u0027d like to change (milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser), but I would still recommend it\n",
    "\nWhen my Braun FlavorSelect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working, I had to scramble to find a new machine. I wanted another Braun, but unfortunately, they seem to have stopped making a 12 cup coffee maker. So I had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features I wanted combined with good value. I finally found it with this Cuisinart model.\n\nThe advantages? For one, it makes excellent and HOT coffee. The carafe is solidly constructed and fits securely in square body so there\u0027s no chance of someone accidentally knocking it loose. Because the lid fits tightly, the pour is precisely narrow and smooth, with no side leaks even when the pot is full. The basket fits inside the housing instead of swinging free like so many models which prevents a misalignment between the water and the filter; the conical (Krups/Braun style) basket accepts both paper filters and gold-tone, although I learned the hard way that not all gold filters fit. The timer is very easy to program, as is the clock. The carafe warmer can be set at low, medium, or high for the temperature that\u0027s right for you. I found the \"high\" setting too hot since I drink my coffee black (I like my coffee hot but not scalding!), but those who add a lot of milk might appreciate it. The brewing is quick and efficient, with the process taking about a minute a cup, maybe less. The retro/stainless look complements most modern kitchen dcors. There\u0027s a 1-4 cup setting to make sure such small amounts stay hot, and you can select how long the warmer remains on. The pot beeps five times when brewing is complete and just before the warming plate shuts off. Parts are top rack dishwasher safe. It comes with a water filter system designed to improve the taste of the brew.\n\nBut the Cuisinart does have disadvantages. The water reservoir is located on the right side, in the back, which makes it a little challenging for lefties like me to dump the final bit of water inside even though the carafe pours very accurately. Although I haven\u0027t yet missed the opening, I do struggle briefly with those last few drops unless I use my right hand. The housing is fairly tall, so if your counter space is only under the cabinets, you may not be able to lift the top in its entirety. (This is when the small rear reservoir becomes a major issue as you have to have room to completely lift the rather large top toward the back.) Clearance required: 7.5\" wide by 8.5\" deep of counter space with no overhead obstruction to pull out for filling OR 21.5\" of overhead space to fully lift top. Without the top open, the coffee maker measures 7.5\"w x 8.5\"d x 14.25\"h.\n\nIf you have the space for this coffee maker, you\u0027ll love it. I can\u0027t attest to how long it will last, but, as it comes with a three year warranty, I\u0027m hoping for a good run\n",
    "\nThis pan heats up evenly, no hot or cool spots, and the handles stay cool.  It\u0027s great for cooking bacon or scrambling eggs.  Cuisinart recommends not turning the heat up to High, and so far, it hasn\u0027t been necessary.  Very good value. \n",
    "\nI have been using a Cuisinart 9\" skillet for a few years now and love it - one of the best pans I\u0027ve ever owned (and I\u0027ve owned a few -top names too). but when my 13\" stainless steel skillet (from another name) warped under too much heat (it couldn\u0027t take the heat from my Viking Range), I immediately started a search for a Cusinart replacement. I couldn\u0027t believe the price. Fortunately I have the lid from the previous pan because the cusinart doesn\u0027t come with one\n",
    "\nWorks very well.  Only drawback it\u0027s large - but stands upright.\nWell worth the money and quit in the low speed.\n",
    "\nThe KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they\u0027d exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. \n\nAt this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer\n",
    "\nI have enjoyed my new KitchenAid.  I\u0027m thinking that I may have liked the smaller model that has the beater that tips up instead of having the bowl lifter, as it is awkward sometimes working around the beater.  Overall, I am happy and can mix a lot in a short amount of time\n",
    "\nThe cirtus juicer works great (like all Kitchen Aid products) but it\u0027s pricy by the time you pay $8 to ship it. However my local outlet mall wanted over $30 for it plus tax..\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve used this set for several years now  and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives. Even though I also own Global and Shun kitchen knives, I find myself being drawn to the Insignia knives when I am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project. Although both the Global and the Shun have sharper edges, their price difference doesn\u0027t equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get. That is to say, yes Global and Shun knives are sharper, but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that. \n\nUsing my Insignia knives, I am able to quickly dice, cut, and slice through onions, carrots, chicken, roasts, etc. That said, there are several cavets that need to be stated. First, don\u0027t wash these knives in a dishwasher. It has nothing to do with the quality of the steel. I wouldn\u0027t wash my Ken Onion Shun Chef\u0027s knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the Insignia. Second, these knives need to be honed regularly. A few strokes after every use makes a real difference. Third, after owning the knives for almost two years, I sharpened each of the knives on oil stones. These knives, like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time. The good news is that they resharpened quite nicely, a tribute to their quality. Since resharpening, they have continued to hold their edges. \n\nLast, the balance of these knives is more than adequate. I also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series. All though I am a bit of a knife snob, and although I would love to purchase a block set of either the Shun or the Globals, I can\u0027t justify it given that the Insignia\u0027s cut so well. My wife would really give me no end of grief if I threw out a perfectly good set of knives. And a good set of knives these are\n",
    "\nMy living room (approx 12\u0027x16\u0027 and open to the kitchen) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day. It sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it. The Bionaire BW2300 cools it in half the time it used to take.\n\n~Edit: My statement that this fan cools my liviing room in half hte time I once did is inaccurate. If the outside temp is lower than inside, the fan cools the living room in just a couple of hours.~\n\nIt also does a great job circulating air when its hot out (and in) to keep the room from feeling stuffy. \n\nI have not experienced the temperature gauge problem that other reviewers have. The temp gauge on mine works well.\n\n~Edit: The thermometer reads the temp of fan\u0027s exact location, not the room\u0027s temperature. For example, in the afternoon sun, mine consistently registers a much higher temp than the actual room tempature. When it is colder outside at night, it registers a slightly colder temp than the room temp. ~\n\nIs it really quiet? Yes! I have a Vornado fan, which is quite quiet for a fan. This is even quieter (although not silent).\n\nTo accomodate different window sizes, this model comes with a built-in extender, and two add-on extenders. The fan with extenders isn\u0027t large enough to fit my 38.5\" window width. I could order another add-on extender from the manufacturer, but stuffed a wash cloth in the gap instead. \n\nWhat comes in the box? The fan, two extenders, two AAA batteries and the remote. \n\n~Edited 7/28/06:\nI bought a second one for my bedroom. Its thermometer is completely inaccurate and overstates the temperature until the outside temp is about 75 degrees.\n\nThe slats which the air blows through are fixed on this model. So I cannot direct the air onto (or away from) a particular area of the room.\n",
    "\nA long time Krups customer, I purchased this blender after 10 years of suffering with a lack luster, non Krups blender, which was given to me as a wedding present. To say this is an outstanding blender would be an understatement. I\u0027m amazed with how quiet the blender is and the best feature is how powerful it is. We use our blender for smoothies in the morning and my husband uses it for his nutrition drinks in the evenings, so we needed something that was durable, substantial and will last a long a time.\n\nAn excellent blender, it was a good investment for our household\n",
    "\nThis is the best cooling rack I have ever seen.  I have used it primarily for cookies, but it works great for other baked goods as well.  Because of the small grid, nothing gets bent or broken.  The size is perfect for putting many cookies on to cool without trying to squeeze them together. Clean up is a breeze.  Just add a couple of recipes and this would make a very nice gift.  I know I wouldn\u0027t want to be without it\n",
    "\nI love this vacuum!  It is great for doing quick jobs around the house, vacuuming the stairs and vacuuming up the lint in the laundry room.

    "\nI purchased this knife because my daughter didn\u0027t like using any of my knives; she wanted one like the chefs all use on Food Network.  I wasn\u0027t willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise, and I\u0027m pleased with it.  It\u0027s nice-looking, feels comfortable to hold, works well for chopping vegetables. Overall, a decent knife at a very reasonable price. \n",

I absolutely love the set - the pans heat up very quickly and clean up beautifully. They\u0027re less expensive than many of the gourmet sets but just as good\n",
    "\nI purchased this product for two reasons: I own other Cuisinart cookware and like it very much...secondly, I frequently make spaghetti sauce with meatballs and find that a 3-quart saucepan just isn\u0027t large enough.

    "\nI\u0027m really glad to have replaced my non-stick with the Cuisinart pans. I have been increasingly concerned about the safety of non-stick. I was really scared that they would stick and I would have to scrub them, but they\u0027ve been really good so far. I\u0027m not crazy about the hazy look that the bottoms get inside, but I know it\u0027s because I cook on med-high heat and I need to get some Barkeeper\u0027s friend. Overall, really pleased with this purchase, and I\u0027m still adding to my set\n",

    "\nThis combo is awesome!  I\u0027ve used coconut oil (very little--it doesn\u0027t burn or smoke when heated) to season it and the press gets better with each use.  I use olive oil for the meat or bread I\u0027m cooking and, although a steak wasn\u0027t seared as much as I would have liked, the pannini are outstanding.  The coconut oil seems to season without coloring so much and this is the first time in a very long life that I\u0027ve correctly seasoned a pan.  Residue now just slips off with hot water and a natural bristled brush.  Please read the use and care instructions--I don\u0027t usually but for some reason sat down and did--you will find them very informative.  I love it\n",

    "\nI love my Vienna Deluxe!  We\u0027ve been using it for 4-8 coffees per day for 7 months now and have certainly saved money over going to the coffee shop.  If you plan to buy more than 100 coffees (for us about 3 months worth) it already pays for itself and the coffee tastes better.  The flavor of the coffee is awesome and it\u0027s super easy to make.  \n\nThe only bad thing I can say about this coffee machine is that the \u0027key\u0027 in the back of it got a little bit off and we had to manually turn it so that the brew unit would fit back in.  It only took us about 2 hours to figure out and fix it, so it wasn\u0027t that big of a deal.    \n\nIf you\u0027re looking for something that is a super high class, fancy, heavy duty, professional style coffee maker, maybe you should spring for the superdeluxe big bucks model and drop a couple grand.  People have given this model low reviews for being expensive and made of plastic.  Ours still looks nice, is easy to clean, and doesn\u0027t weigh 750 million pounds.  It seems like folks are looking for a chrome and steel Starbucks style coffee maker for $500, and that just isn\u0027t realistic.  \n\nThis is a great buy and it makes great coffee\n",

The bowl component is my number 1 favorite feature of this little guy, but it just plain works really well\n",
    "\nThese pans are mahvelous, dahling.  Having said that, I\u0027ve read lots of reviews that included complaints about the strength of the adhesive used to stick the labels on the pans.  To one, to all:  There is a product called \"GOO GONE\" that is designed for just this type of thing.  You can find it almost anywhere, hardware stores, grocery stores, etc.  It works in minutes, and leaves no trace of the adhesive behind.  Just be sure the wash the pan afterwards.  Happy adhesive-free baking\n",

No hassles of the top jamming and having to beat it open with a knife. You will need a finer strainer if you want to filter out citrus pulp, for example. But for most cocktails you are just straining out the ice. But I like this one for it\u0027s convenience\n",
    "\nThis machine is really a great invention - especially for those of us who have a tendency to spend on good tea and then screw up some part of the process that falls between the brewing and the first sip (for example, infusing the tea for too long).  I think my tea will have more of a fighting chance with this new machine.  The design is great - quite classy, and I think it will be great for entertaining (loved the way the tray that holds the machine could suddenly be converted into a serving tray for the well-designed tea pot and cups).  Here is how it worked for me: \nYou pour your loose tea in the infuser basket, fill the tank with water, select the strength of your beverage and turn it on.  There\u0027s even a chance to choose which kind of tea you are brewing for optimal results (for example oolong or green).  This nifty little machine will do the rest.  It will even pour the tea in the tea pot!  I\u0027m finally enjoying my fine tea without the stress.  It\u0027s almost like having a tea butler in my house!\n",
    "\nThe KitchenAid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect.  They are very will made and excellent quality.  The silicone material is amazing, it is so easy to clean, whether you are using this mixing spatula with cake mix, cookie dough or anything you are mixing or scraping nothing will sticks to it.  The curved design on this spatula is a perfect match to the KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and it also works very well with my All Clad mixing bowls.  With this spatula you will not miss a drop of anything in the bowl.  Highly recommended\n",
    "\nThis tea pot, like their French-Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass\u0027 - it doesn\u0027t seem to break.  I\u0027m hard on things and usually need heavy-duty models just for every day survival.  I\u0027ve had this tea pot for - maybe 8 years - unheard of for things around me. The glass just doesn\u0027t seem to break.  Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea - a brilliant idea.  But here\u0027s the other cool thing: when you get a `presentation\u0027 tea like say a `peony\u0027 tea that opens into a flower or say, a sea-shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls\u0027 floating above it - you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does.\n\nThe ONLY down side is that the cap won\u0027t fit on the tea pot if you take the infuser out.  But I have never found that to be a problem.  The tea MAY cool a bit faster - but not so much so that it bothers me.  The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I\u0027ve had speaks to it\u0027s wonder and durability.  Like I said, this is made of magic glass.\n",

    "\nThis is the best spatula I have ever owned, and I have owned entirely too many. It is strong and wide and slightly curved at the front edge to fit my pans. The front edge is also nice and thin so it slides right under any food. And it cleans up like magic-no holes for junk to get stuck in. And you can rest it right on the skillet without it melting or lay it on the counter because the handle is curved in such a manner as to keep the head from resting on the countertop. Seriously-the best spatula ever\n",

All the handles look great, but are also very comfortable and practical.  This strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people.  You can use this double rod strainer not only for straining, but also for sifting flour, draining, and if need be - awkwardly steaming veggies over boiling water.\n\nIt seems most people might go for the 8\" instead, but this one works perfectly for making gnocchi from scratch.  You have to make few enough in each batch that they can all rise to the top at once.  Then you scoop them all up with the strainer (the bigger strainer may be hard to fit in many pots).  Drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel.  Since you can do all this with one hand, you can use your other hand to grab more gnocchi to start a-boilin\u0027 quick as can be.\n\nWhatever you use it for, this is a high quality strainer that will last\n",

    "\nI immediately noticed the quality of this wok as soon as I took it out of the box. Very nice looking. Very easy to cook in. It\u0027s big and has large sides so it is very easy to stir the stir fry around without spilling it. The non stick surface works beautifully. Reattaching the wok to the base after cleaning is fairly easy although the wok never seems to lock 100% correctly into place without a little hassle. I\u0027m not sure it really matters if it\u0027s not perfectly 100% aligned into the base anyway. Nevertheless, that\u0027s only a minor gripe. This wok makes stir fry easy and fun and makes the food taste really good. The included spatula was a nice gesture, too. The instructions say the wok can do a lot of other things too, like slow cooking, but I only use it for stir fry\n",

And I will confess, I\u0027ve used the medium sized one as an emergency gravy boat. So it doesn\u0027t look quite as nice as a cut glass gravy server--it works JUST fine.   I also use the glass cups for mixing batters to pour out right from the pitcher, and I use them for prepping foods like stir fry when you have to have a bunch of ingredients ready to hand to dump at once into the wok. \n\n",

It isn\u0027t perfect but I\u0027m well on my way.  I have been making the low fat version but I think the regualar version will be excellent. To make this machine work for you here are some pointers:\n1.  If you don\u0027t have an upright or chest freezer, put the bowl in the back of your regular freezer.  \n2.  Freeze the bowl for as long as possible beyond the suggested 12 hours.  \n3.  You can forget the 12-15 minute check described in the manual.  You will not have a chance of having soft serv before a minimum of 25 minutes.  I mixed as long as 40 minutes.  \n4.  SAVE YOUR RECEIPT.  Since the ice cream takes twice as long to mix as is suggested in the manual, you are using the motor 2x as much.  Therefore, you might have to use the 3 year warranty.\n",

    "\nHenkel Pro S knives are second to none.  They will last a lifetime and make a tremendous difference in your cooking.  These knives take the \u0027chore\u0027 out of cutting vegis\n",
    "\nthe 8\" chef\u0027s knife is a little heavy, but other than that, they both work great so far...especially for the price. i\u0027ve used them daily for a month, and they have not lost their sharpness at all.\n",
    "\nHenckels Twin Signature 7-Piece Block Set is exactly what I\u0027d hoped that it would be: a quality set of knives that is ideal for the home.\n\nThe set of Henckels that I\u0027ve owned since the mid-80s finally gave in to a lot of use, sharpenings and dishwashings (dishwashing a good knife is a nice way to shorten the handle\u0027s life expectancy!). But 20 years of great service from my previous set of Henckels certainly warranted a loyal update/upgrade to another Henckels set.\n\nAnd I am not disappointed. The new set is quite sturdy. Home users will be impressed with their strength; pros might be used to a higher standard, but I used to work in a professional kitchen and I can\u0027t see how these would not be as effective as anything a pro has. \n\nThese knives come out of the box SHARP too...a lot sharper than the sharpest that I\u0027ve ever had my previous set sharpened to. \n\nThere were two descriptions from Amazon that tell you what you get; one of Amazon\u0027s descriptions included a carving knife (product description) and the other a peeling knife (what\u0027s in the box). Amazon seems to have corrected the error as of this updated 2-13-2006 writing. To be sure, here\u0027s what you actually get:\n\n- 2 1/2\" peeling knife \n- 4\" paring knife\n- 5\" serrated knife\n- 8\" chef\u0027s knife...this baby cuts through a roast like a hot knife through butter even though it\u0027s designed for chopping and dicing. In my opinion, it\u0027s better than a carving knife.\n- a sharpening steel\n- kitchen shears \n- and a storage block with 11 slots which is great because some of the knives, especially the serrated knives, from my old set are still in mint shape (like the 8\" bread knife), so there\u0027s plenty of room in the block for knives in your current collection looking for a new place to sleep.\n\nNo 8\" carving knife. But like I said above, the 8\" chef\u0027s knife works better than any carving knife that I\u0027ve used.\n\nThe only things missing from this set for the average home is a nice large bread knife (as I said this was not a problem for me) and steak knives (also not a problem as most households already have these). Plain and simple, this is a great set of food preparation knives that--if my previous set is any indication--will last for decades.\n\nBon Appetite.\n \n",
    "\nA very solid knife set, especially with the extra slots for those who have a few \"favorite\" knifes left in the drawer.  MAKE SURE when you buy Henckels to get the \"twin\" set instead of the single little henckel-man, that\u0027s a big upgrade in quality.  Oh, and for goodness sake people, quit putting your knife set through the dishwasher and just clean them as you go\n",

    "\nThe French-made Roul\u0027pat, like its cousin the Silpat, is a flexible silicon mat enclosing a thin, fiberglass mesh for durability. The Roul\u0027pat is designed for creating a non-skid work surface for rolling out and kneading dough. The tacky surface adheres to the counter without clinging to the dough, making it easier to roll out thin pastry crusts and the like. Because the mat is flexible, the transfer of a pie crust to pan is a cinch. Dipped chocolates don\u0027t stick, nor does fondant. At sixteen and a half inches by twenty-four, the surface is expansive enough for most recipes. The only drawback to this unusual mat is the inability to cut on it, ruling out anything that requires a cookie cutter or knife. The manufacturer also warns against folding and scraping the surface.\n\nI find the Roul\u0027pat works best on pie crusts, pizza dough, chocolate, and flatbreads (or any bread dough that requires rolling or shaping.) Clean up is simple - wipe with a damp sponge and rinse. Mild soap can be used if needed, although I try to keep the surface detergent free. (The Roul\u0027pat is not dishwasher safe.)\n\nThis makes a fantastic gift for cooks who seem to have everything\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve owned this grill pan for almost 2 years now and it does a great job of grilling everything from burgers to chicken, fish and thick steaks. It has the ability to heat up to a very high temperature, enabling me to nicely sear the outside of the meat. I can then pop the whole pan in the oven to finish cooking the inside of thick steaks or just to keep warm. As for clean up, the pan does need to sit and soak for a little while but after that, everything comes off with relative ease. No hard scrubbing involved. Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it\n",

I wanted to make freshly ground wheat tortillas for the cost savings and for the superior nutrition. I am very pleased with the results. I grind my wheat, but leave out the oil because I submurge my doe in olive oil so it will keep fresh for days in my frig and then work the oil into the doe just before pressing and cooking. The machine really works, and its easy to use. It a quality machine and is a mainstay of my healthy kitchen\n",

When my daughter was younger, it was great for her because she could make her own hot chocolate or instant macaroni and cheese, and I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about her being burned on the hot stove. With the hot shot, you just pour your water in the top and hit the \"heat\" button.

    "\nPurchased these to go with a 7 inch Henckels International santoku that I\u0027ve been using for years, and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all Fine Edge cutlery is \"good enough.\"  No, it isn\u0027t restaurant quality, and yes, if you put these through the dishwasher they\u0027ll tarnish and probably even start to rust (any metal designated as \"stainless\" is rust resistant rather than rust proof, and reviewers of other Henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably aren\u0027t treating their knives very well).  As a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking, but doesn\u0027t always have the time for it, these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality.  Be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening - I\u0027ve had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely - and should probably be hand-washed for longest life.  With that little bit of maintenance, however, this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs (it meets all of mine, but then I don\u0027t often dress poultry, filet my own fish, or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife) for quite a nice price\n",
    "\nAfter reading all the reviews and hearing about this on the radio, I went ahead and shelled out $100 for this.  I had really high expectation, having never spent so much for a heater before.  I have happy to say that I am completely satisfied.  This heater doesn\u0027t overwhelm and dry out the room with too much heat.  Instead it circulates the heat over time (you should probably give it a good half hour to properly heat the whole room) evenly heating the whole room and leaving absolutely no cold spots.  After spending some time in my room, I had completely forgotten how cold it was outside.  Other bonuses are that it is very easy to operate and has a thermostat so you can set it to the exact termerature that you want your room to be.  My only minor complaint is that for its price, it should have included a remote control.  Otherwise, it is a wonderful heater\n",

    "\nI have to say that I have tried almost all of the self-cleaning litter boxes out there for my Large Male 14year old cat.  He has the electric water fountain for kitties and yes he does drink lot and lots of water, so you know what that means, yes, he pees a lot.  Oh yea he is a larger (not fat) kitty so he eats a lot also, I aint sayin no more on that subject.\n\nIt has now been 25 AMAZING!!!!!! SCOOP/POOP/PEE CLUMP/URIN ODOR/POOP SMELL/LOTS \u0026 LOTS \u0026 LOTS OF ANOYING TRACKED SANDY LITTER .......................FREE DAYS!!!!!\n\nThis is not saying that this litter box does not have any room for improvement, but I am one happier kitty owner.  I will tell anyone that hates Doody \u0026 Pee Clump Duty, or that hates the tracked litter mess and nasty clumped up (metal or plastic) rake \u0026 plastic that never fits right storage container, get this litter box.\n\nThe main gripe I have with this litter box is the cost of the replacement crystal litter cartridges, but I have been told by numerous pet store owners and workers that there will probably be a generic competitor on the market soon which will hopefully bring the price of the litter cartridges down.  One can only hope!  But regardless, I am keeping this auto waste center for my cay.\n\nThe other gripe, but not major problem I have seen so far, is with the cardboard for the cartridge that the litter sits in.  Now my cat, with a regular clumping litter box had clumps the size of softballs.  After 25 days, there is, on the bottom of the inside tray, (not the bottom one that actually touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the thing out) a wet spot in the area that my cat likes to urinate at, apparently this is his favorite spot to pee.  On the bottom cardboard tray (the one that touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the cartridge out) there is just the hint of a wet spot.  I think that if they increase the wax content in the cardboard or if that is what is actually coating the cardboard this will help.\n\nI have not had to realign the rake as other people have said they had to do.  I do not smell any urine or poop and there is a lot of shrunken poop under that cardboard tray cover.  I have minimal tracked crystal litter on the floor around and/or under the litter box.  The motor is not as quiet as I would like, but then again it doesn\u0027t bother me or wake anyone in my house up either, it is kept on a wooden floor right out side the bedroom door in a hallway.\n\nIf you are in the market for an almost maintenance free litter box for your cat, try this one.  Like I said earlier, it\u0027s not 100% perfect, but it is the best damn self cleaning, almost maintenance free litter box on the market.  Not every kitty or human for that matter poops and pees that same, so if you don\u0027t try it you will never know if it\u0027s right for you and your kitty/kitties.  Read all the rest of the reviews for this and other products and see what everyone is saying about all of them, make an educated decision\n\nGood Luck\n",
    "\nI bought this product back in July 2005 and have been using it to make my morning protein shakes.  It does a good job of it.  I cannot comment on its ability to make icecream as I try to stay away from that stuff.  The unit has a very solid construction.  The stainless steel glass is great.  I just drink my shake from it.  So it saves me from having to wash another glass.  I just have one small issue with it.  You cannot remove the spindle to clean it. You have to use the stainless steel glass with warm, soapy water, put it under the spindle and then rotate it around to clean it.  Well, the problem is this - while I am drinking my shake, the spindle is dripping liquid on the part of the unit that flares out on the bottom.  Okay, okay, it\u0027s no big deal, I suppose.  All in all, I like this product, and I would recommend it.\n",
    "\nI LOVE this set.  This was the first \"real\" cookware I\u0027ve ever bought.  My husband and I did months of research before purchasing this set.  We\u0027ve had it now for about 2 months and I can\u0027t express how much we\u0027ve enjoyed it.  I\u0027ve read several reviews that say food sticks and so on, but I think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick, it is.  It\u0027s not!  Think of it like this:  It cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick (maybe even better!).  We almost went with the All Clad, but we just couldn\u0027t get over how uncomfortable the handles were.  Since I haven\u0027t cooked with All Clad, I can\u0027t compare the Calphalon One to it, but I will say they heat evenly and cook evenly.  Clean up is SUPER easy!  Just this morning I made bacon and french toast.  I looked at the pans and thought \"There is no way I\u0027ll ever get this clean!\"  I poured some Bar Keeper\u0027s friend on it and went to work with my Scotch Brite pad and within MINUTES it was spotless!  Fantastic\n",
    "\nMy fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us.  I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware.  This is exactly what the Dr. ordered!  Here\u0027s why:\n1)  Heavy, sturdy construction.  These things can take a beating.  They heat evenly and hold heat very well.\n2)  You can use metal utensils with them.  I hate plastic spatulas!  We all know that we aren\u0027t supposed to use metal with non-stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless, peeling shadow of its former self.  Well this isn\u0027t the case with Calphalon 1!  Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear.  \n3)  They \"stick\" and sear as well as cast iron cookware (it\u0027s a good thing).  This is the best feature for me.  Coated non-stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that\u0027s not non-stick such as stainless steel or cast iron.  They \"stick\" for a reason.  You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning.  Now there\u0027s the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non-stick pan.  It\u0027s a no-brainer!  \n4)  They look cool, have great handles, they\u0027re oven-safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty.  \n\nThese are not cheap.  If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don\u0027t buy this expensive set.  It will dissapoint you.  But, if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable, functional set, and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top-of-the-line product then this is for you.  Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware\n",

Yes, things stick in the groove, but I just use a silicone spatula while cooking and I don\u0027t seem to have a problem.  I love the capacity and size/shape of this unit. Scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot, as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting. But sometimes my pumpkin pie filling gets bits of cooked egg if I\u0027m not diligent about stirring out the groove. The width/depth ratio allows me to really get my whisk or spatula inside to work. \n\nSometimes the dishwasher (horrors, I know!) doesn\u0027t get the groove completely clean.

Last night I tried eating them with non-fat yogurt cheese sweetened with a bit of sugar.  It was delicious and much healthier!

The toaster also has a basket that holds the bread/bagel in place while it is being toasted.  This feature is really nice when toasting soft things such as pop-tarts.  Good variance of heat controls too.  I have not found anything bad on this one.  Good choice\n",

We own only one lid that fits more than one pot/pan (the one for the 10 in. pan, 3 qt. saute, 6 qt. stockpot)--and we have 4 other lids which fit only a single pot, some of which are within 1/2 in. of being the same width!\n\nHowever, we\u0027d still get these pans again in a second, and probably go for the 13-piece set instead of the 8 piece as well\n",
    "\nI used to have the Calphalon Commercial Non-Stick and I prefer these.  The stainless steel pans seem to heat up faster, are easier to handle and you can put them in the dishwasher (although Calphalon prefers you handwash them).

    "\nHaving gone through our share of toaster ovens in 22 years of marriage, this is by far the best.  It\u0027s classy looking on the counter, easy to clean, very lightweight, quiet and has alot of options for toasting and baking that make the food come out just as it should.   I can\u0027t imagine going back to a traditional toaster oven again. \n",

    "\nThe Villaware Panini Grill has proved to be a very useful appliance, so much so that I leave it out on the counter - it\u0027s quite attractive, and certainly not an eyesore.  I use it often, for grilled sandwiches, of course, but also for grilled meats and fish.  I would caution users to avoid meat with bones, e.g. lamb chops(you can\u0027t get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill), and to be very careful about timing: things get done twice as fast!  While the cleaning \"comb\" is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill, you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately; much easier to do if the grill is warm (not hot).  I haven\u0027t tried grilling vegetables, yet, but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way, or eggplant, or peppers.\nI am very happy with the quality of this product\n",
    "\nI\u0027m blown away! With 48 blades, this product really does the job quickly and quietly.  No more BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! echoing off the walls which only produced a flat but still tough piece of meat.  I\u0027d gladly pay twice the cost for the Deni because it works!  It\u0027s very sturdy, very sharp and easy to clean in the DW.  I\u0027m using cheaper cuts of meat sucessfully in recipes I had stored away because of toughness or price.  Marinating is faster and more effective, cooking time can be reduced.  Keep it away from kids.  Protect your countertop.  The best kitchen gadget I ever bought!!\n",
    "\nThe first time I used it I put a little white vinegar into the water with the eggs and timer. It seemed to cut down on the plastic smell. Also the vinegar will seal your eggs if they crack preventing the insides from leaking out. I did notice the timer has to be completely dark for the eggs to be done instead of the little light circle in the middle like is stated on the packag\n",
    "\nAs a person who could set boiling water on fire, I can truely state that this hard boiled egg timer has helped me be able to boil an egg.

It has a powerful motor that can easily break ice, plus the Blender jar is made of really thick, unbreakable material, unlike many other Glass Blender jars. One other feature I like about this combo is its wave action technology, which can continuously pull down the mixture in it and this system really works. The Food processor is large enough to chop/mix fruits and vegetables, and above all it saves a lots of space in my kitchen. I have read a lots of bad reviews from many people about other Combos like this, but I don\u0027t know what these people are exactly trying to do with a Blender/Food Processor. \n",

If you also are looking for a mug\u0027s worth of coffee, I would recommend purchasing the 4-cup model as that would leave just a bit more room, and keep more of the small grindings in the press, rather than in the bottom of my cup.  \nAlso, it should be noted that Bodum sells the spare parts for this press (right here on Amazon, in fact), so if you should break it, a few dollars will get you back in Java!  \nAnother note, some people have mentioned that dumping the grindings proves problematic as you can\u0027t just put them down the drain (plugs up your trap).  I have found an easy solution in using the plastic and wire mesh grind basket of my last automatic coffee maker as a strainer.  I just pour the bit of water and grinds out of the press and into the basket (which I leave in the sink), and allow the water to run off.  Then I pour shake the dry coffee into the trash.  No fuss, and the basket is dishwasher safe for the occasional cleaning\n",
    "\n     For ideal coffee using a French press is the best method.  It takes a bit more time and effort, but results in much better tasting coffee.  This is because due to the lower temperatures and the lack of a paper filter the coffee oils stay in tact.  This adds a lot of flavor to the coffee that is lost otherwise.  \n     As for this French press in particular: size does matter.  If you make enough coffee that you aren\u0027t drinking by the single mug then just get a bigger press.  I drink about a pot and half of coffee most week days and find the effort required to use this smaller press a hassle.  As such I just keep this press at home and only use it in the evenings. \n",

You get a few grinds on the counter but that is a small price to pay for delicious fresh coffee.\n\nTh A-9 has a strong relatively quiet motor (which means it is still loud, but not as loud as most other burr grinders0 and takes up very little counter space. The glass hopper for the beans seals at the top with a scrw on lid.\n\nI love the idea of the measuring cup which saves a lot of time scooping.\nIt eliminates that step...just grind until you have the right amount and dump it into your coffee basket.\n\nKitchen Aid has a nice Pro model that costs twice as much by why pay more for less\n",

    "\nI\u0027m glad I bought this griddle! I\u0027ve been stuck with teflon-coated nonstick pans for a while, and when I saw such great deals on cast iron pans, I had to buy a few. I ordered the griddle, the ~10\" Logic grill pan, and the ~10\" skillet. Thankfully all three qualified for free Super Saver shipping, because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves! The order was placed late Monday night, and I was promised that my pans would ship by the following Monday. By Wednesday the griddle had arrived, and the grill pan showed up on Friday. Way to go, UPS! It turns out that its good to get these things early, because it takes a few days to get the \"natural finish\" pans properly seasoned. I think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly. Food won\u0027t stick to a cast iron pan if you\u0027ve taken the time to season it until it\u0027s black and almost totally non-stick. It takes some time and paitence, but it\u0027s the same way with a good wok: you get out of it what you put into it, and this certainly reflects in one\u0027s cooking. Iif you\u0027re going to buy one of these pans, DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Ask Google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan. If you want to save some time, just buy the Logic line of pans, because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase (the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original). Keep in mind that you will eventually have to re-season the pan, but hopefully not for a while (we\u0027ll see how the grill pan turns out).\n\nI agree with some of the other reviews, the handle could stand to be made a little longer. I am a pretty physically fit chef, and I still find the griddle to be pretty hefty. A little extra ease of carrying a heavy piece of what\u0027s usually very hot iron would be great. I\u0027ve found that grabbing it with a folded cotton (natural fibers don\u0027t melt!) towl helps, or if you\u0027re serious about using cast iron (and you like to sear meat on it) you should invest in a pair of welder\u0027s gloves or something equally thick and heavy and fireproof.\n\nThis morning I pulled the griddle out of the oven where it had spent the past few days being alternately heated, rubbed down with peanut oil, and cooled; and I heated it up and made pancakes. You have not LIVED until you eat pancakes cooked on a hot cast iron surface. Teflon-coated pans simply cannot compare. I can\u0027t wait to try making grilled-cheese sandwiches, omelettes, and hashed browns on this griddle. With any luck, this will be the last griddle I ever need to buy (and hopefully the griddle my grandchildren won\u0027t have to buy)\n",

    "\nI learned a long time ago, if you go KitchenAid, you go for life. They make the highest quality, longest life products I have ever seen. This hand mixer is the third of its kind I\u0027ve owned. I\u0027ve had two of the Braun models and they died out after about a year of average use. I finally got the KitchenAid and it has been going strong for a few years now. I really like having the ability to go down to the bottom of a large pot, a full 8\". Even though it is of substantial weight, it fits your hand like a glove. I found it far superior to the Braun, as a matter of fact, it doesn\u0027t even compare.\nThe plastic cup with lid makes an excellent accessory since you can mix and store without wasting time. The chopper is the most efficient I have seen, does a better job that a food processor. I especially like the multi-speed dial. It goes from 1 to 9 so it has the power you need, when you need it. Egg white or whip cream doesn\u0027t even challenge it, the whipping attachment makes sure of that.  This baby  handles like a pro.

    "\nThis is my favorite salad spinner, and I\u0027ve tried several over the last couple years.  It dries my lettuce very well, and has some useful features that I haven\u0027t seen in other spinners.\n\nLike the old Zyliss spinner, you pull on a handle to spin the basket.  But with this one the more you pull, the faster it spins, kind of like revving up a top or something.   It spins much faster than those \u0027crank\u0027 spinners or the \u0027push down\u0027 type -and faster spinning means more water off your veggies.\n\nAs for the new features, here are my top five: \n\n1) The lid is clear, so you can see the veggies spinning around in there and make sure you\u0027re not overfilling the spinner, the lettuce isnt bunching up in one corner, etc. OK, it\u0027s also just mesmerizing to watch your food spin round and round.  Kind of like watching your clothes roll around in the dryer.\n\n2) There is a brake! So after you\u0027ve whipped  your veggies into a frenzy, you can slam them to a stop -which also helps get more water off.  This works better on the small sized spinner, since there is less weight to stop, but even on the big spinner it works very well.  I have seen a brake on another spinner, but this one works much better.\n\n3) The cord pulls itself back in -and gently: I disliked how the old \u0027string\u0027 spinners would yank on your arm, and if you didn\u0027t respond just right the string wouldn\u0027t pull in at all: it ends up just sitting there in a pile.  You\u0027d have to take the lid off and wind it up yourself!  This new design winds the cord up every time.\n\n4) The basket is smooth on the inside -that\u0027s something I defintely have not seen before.  It\u0027s a subtle feature, but very helpful: it helps make sure little bits of your lettuce dont get stuck in the basket when you\u0027re cleaning it out.\n\n5) You can stack things on top of it, both in the fridge and in the cupboard, because the top is mostly flat.  The handle even sits in its own little pocket in the lid so that it\u0027s not in the way.  In my house fridge space is valuable and I appreciate being able to stack this spinner like I do with my tupperware.\n\nSo, overall I am impressed with this spinner (so impressed that I\u0027ve also given it as a gift!).  It does its job very well and has thoughtful extra features which make it more helpful around the kitchen\n",

This pan just sat there and that was impressive. \n\nThe base is completely flat and that is the beauty.

I bake whole grain muffins and breads every week and find this pan to be extremely useful.  \n\nThe breads that I have made released easily after they had cooled.  I find it best to place this pan on a cooling rack for about an hour before removing the bread from the pans.  If you do this it releases completely.  If the bread is still warm when you try to remove it, it might not come out in one piece.\n\nI have found that it is best to put this pan on a half sheet pan prior to filling it with dough or batter.  If you try to carry it to the oven without a pan underneath it, it is not very steady.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have other silicone bakeware you are unfamiliar with the nicest feature of this product.  You can squish it up in a ball to store it, and bounces back to its original shape when you need it.\n\nMy only complaint about this pan is that the bread does not brown as well on the bottom as sides as it does in a metal pan.  But, being able to make 6 medium sized loaves at one time more than makes up for decrease in browning.\n",

Whoever designed this stuff got the shape and materials right; it is very aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe main downside is that at 1 quart, it is not as useful if you need to cook for more than 2-4 people.\n\nNote to the person who had the pan discolor: simply sprinkle a little bit of \"Barkeeper\u0027s Friend\" in the pan and rub with a damp sponge. I find this cleaner shines up all my stainless steel to like-new condition with no scrubbing or scratching. It also works to keep the copper banding looking shiny\n",
    "\nI bought a dozen of these from another retailer (at half price) and I love them! They are perfect for everything that requires a small size container.  I use the cups to beat two eggs, melt butter, heat up baby food (never heat food in any plastic), to serve ketchup or other condiments, store a small amount of leftovers, etc. By using the appropriately sized cup, I save a lot of space in both the fridge and the dishwasher.  I recommend these highly\n",
    "\n... and I don\u0027t even make Custard! *LOL*  I just love these for small servings of ice cream, fruit, side dishes, etc.  They are great with meals for anything that you don\u0027t want to mix with the other foods on your plate.  They are perfect for snacks and desserts.  They are great for things such as pickles, olives, chopped onions, relish, dips, etc. on a casual buffet or picnic table.  They also work well for pre-portioning ingredients when making a complicated recipe or allowing younger kids to cook with you.  The typical Pyrex glass which is thick and a bit heavy is perfect for my family because it holds up to less than gentle everyday use.  I still want my children to learn to be careful with china and glassware, but I see no reason to be too \u0027precious\u0027 about everday dishware\n",
    "\n*****\nI bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something---like a little yogurt, or some granola, some fresh raspberries---and we use them all the time.  I agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep.\n\nThey are not thin, as a previous reviewer has noted.  They are not thick or bulky either, though, just perfect.  They seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well.  They almost look, well...elegant, which seems kind of cool for just Pyrex and for the price.  \n\nThe bowls come well-packaged, and although the price is very low, they definitely don\u0027t seem cheaply made.  I haven\u0027t seen them in stores, either.  Great buy!\n****\n",
    "\nThese small cups come in handy for making custard, warming baby food and for individual servings of snacks, and food items,etc.  Delivery was prompt.

    "\nLots of reviews already, so let\u0027s not waste your time:\n\nPros:\n- easy to setup (no waiting for charcoal or having to buy propane)\n- easy to clean\n- practical. U can use it indoor/outdoor\n- No flames, so it\u0027s quite hard to actually burn the food\n\nCons:\n- Doesn\u0027t cook the food 100% evenly. Noticed that the area around the thermostat is hotter. Not by much though, but you can notice the grill marks on the food stronger when near the thermostat\n- Doesn\u0027t get really really hot. If you\u0027re trying to cook Brazilian style (large chunk of meat), it might not work out. However, it\u0027s great if you cut it into smaller chunks of meat.\n\nOverall:\nI love this so much that some days I use this for lunch and for dinner. There are no pans to clean. Only reason I don\u0027t give 5 stars is because it\u0027s not even throughout the whole plate.\n\n",
    "\nThis little grill is not so little, with a large grill surface, but it takes up so little space on my apartment\u0027s patio - so it is perfect for those of us who only have a small patio or balcony. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and grills perfectly - no mess, no fuss.\n",

    "\nI bought this timer, because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had, with the big display and the simple, three-button operation. This particular timer was better priced than most I looked at, and I liked the extra large display. I have been very happy with it. The buttons don\u0027t stick like other timers I have used. I like the way the memory feature works, and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice\n",
    "\nHad this on my Amazon wish list, but then came across it for the same price at a Target store and bought it (sorry Amazon). And I really am pleased so far. My toddler has allergies and his allergist had recommended an air purifier for his room. We did lots of research in looking for the right one that was still affordable. I really like that this one has washable filters. Lots of $$$ savings there. Since getting this, my son has had fewer runny noses and no severe allergy symptons. We\u0027ve even been able to drop two of his three allergy meds - - not sure yet though if this is due to the seasons, or perhaps we were possibly over-medicating him before, or if this thing really does work that kind of miracle. Either way, fewer snotty noses makes me happy. In regard to the concerns over noise, this one is fairly quiet. I keep it on low pretty much all the time and it is hardly noticeable. My son has no problem sleeping with it running in the same room. The oscillating feature is nice and it has a small nightlight on it that comes in handy. I would definitely recommend the Honeywell HFD 120.\n",
    "\nI bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price.  I expected it to get me through that winter only.  I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years, heat in fall/winter and fan in summer.  It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter.  The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on/off/heat control wheel is starting to become loose.  Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated.  The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on/off more or less appropriately.  I\u0027d give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough.  I just bought two more, my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails.  A good, solid product for a very good price\n",
    "\nBest 20$ I\u0027ve ever spent. It does have some flaws as stated previously in other reviews, the knobs are hard to read but I\u0027ve found that I use it so much that I really don\u0027t need to be able to see it anymore. The thermometer seems stable, I never have a problem with it getting too hot in the winter, and it manages to heat my efficiency apartment very well. The cord is \u0027regular\u0027 length so it\u0027s not tiny and I don\u0027t need an extension cord. Over all on a students budget I\u0027ve definitely found a winner\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve had another press for many years, but I couldn\u0027t get to it and had cravings for some Spritz cookies. So... I went out and bought this cookie press and to my amazement was very impressed with all the additional accessories it came with. The press worked beautifully (I\u0027ve only used the small barrel so far.) I was concerned that it was battery operated, my last one was a plug in model. But it is nice not to be limited to working near a plug. We had no problems with the unit, it worked quite nicely. I\u0027m looking forward to trying out some of the accessory attachments in the future. I would definitely recommend this press to anyone looking to buy a cookie press\n",

    "\nThis product works wonders! I am big into making my own flavors, and making healthier than store bought versions.  This machine is great for that! It isn\u0027t loud at all, definately a big upgrade from the salt and ice mixer I used to have that could wake up the dead.  The fact that you just pop your ingredients in the canister and stick it in is amazing, no messy clean up whatsoever, or need for trips to the store for ice/salt.  The only slight disadvantage is that if you want to add toppings that spread throughout, you need to add it after its almost at icecream consistency and for that you have to pop off the top (theres no slide window to add through while its mixing).   But even doing that extra step is simple after 30 min\u0027s of churning.  Soft ice cream DEFINATELY never takes longer than 45, usually 37-40, and hard is about 45-48 min.   \nBuy it and Enjoy!!\n",

    "\nDarling tea pot.  Beautiful colors!  Serves several people.  Just lovely\n",
    "\nThe table comes unassembled, but assembly is easy. You will need a large phillips and medium sized phillips screwdrivers. Also the supports on the side for the top will need to be driven on using a hammer, or large chunk of scrap wood. The fit on mine was too tight to be simply slid on. Construction is the cam type that is popular now. All pieces are adequately labled, and small hardware comes nicely packaged; the most convenient I have ever seen. There is an error in the assembly documentation. There are two pieces (1B and 1C, the table sides) which are as far as I can tell are identical. After hardware is installed as indicated on pabe 6 of 13 there is a difference. The two sides are mirror images. On the following page part 1C is shown but labled 1B. This error did not cause me a problem during assembly. The intent was clear to me.\n\nThe looks are good. It looks a little clunky to achieve an excellent rating from me. A little milling would help a lot on the drawer face\n",
    "\nWe\u0027ve gotten into homemade custard-based ice cream and that means careful stirring to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. The design of the working end of the whisk allows the head to reach every bit of the pot but without my having to twist my stirring arm into a knot. Since the head is hinged, it lies flat in a drawer which is a good thing, too\n",

Since I am only an occasional tea drinker, I tend to leave water in the kettle and move it to hot burners when cooling (I have cast iron elements/electric oven so burners stay hot for awhile after use).  Other tea kettles create rusty water, since water remains in the kettle.  Not this one!  It boils water rapidly and is great looking on the stove.  My handle does not get hot and, like I said, I have cast iron elements which really heat up and remain hot.  I do agree that you cannot take the whistle off without an oven mit.  That\u0027s the only flaw; they should have made the whistle heat resistant like the handle\n",

Very heavyweight with no warping.  What a buy! \n",

This 3 qt. pan is even nicer than the pans I bought almost 20 years ago and is higher than the old model with a nicer lid/rolled edges and nicer bottom--and it really is beautiful--very classic styling.

The blades are sharp and well constructed, and the handles are comfortable and seem durable. The set only comes with two long knives, so you may find yourself washing them while cooking, but we like to use the steak knives for chopping smaller vegetables or trimming meat and have thus rarely found that we are short on knives while cooking. If you\u0027re looking to do professional work, these knives probably won\u0027t fit your needs, but for an average cook, we use them a lot and haven\u0027t found anything they can\u0027t handle.

    "\nThis is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased (actually I purchased the extra coarse version), but the only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5* rating to. The other grater was from the standard line not the professional line. With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters!\n\nAll Microplane graters use the same basic technology for cutting -- technology which was originally developed for the woodworking industry but that has adapted for exceptional service in the kitchen as well. The razor sharp laser cut grating head will make quick \u0026 easy work of cheese grating or citrus zesting (if you have the proper size). I would suggest when choosing a size of grater that you choose 1 size larger as the sizing tends to run on the small size.\n\nNow, what makes the professional so much better? Well, the standard line has 3 major/minor flaws: 1) the easy-grip rubber handle tends to capture water when washed, 2) the plastic molded frame holding the grating surface cracks when washed in the dishwasher, \u0026 3) the head is so incredibly sharp that it must be kept covered, yet there is no easy way to due this except for the original tagboard cover.\n\nThe professional version fixes all of these issues. As you can see, the frame and handle are all stainless steel which eliminates issues #1 \u0026 #2 and the professional version comes with a nice snap-on plastic cover to protect the sharp head surface.  In addition, the rubberized rest on the top of this version can come in very handy.\n\nEnd result: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n",

I do not have that problem with this design.  \n\nTo answer another reviewers\u0027 question on plasic vs. glass separaters -- I had a glass one and it broke despite being touted as heat resistant glass. When I poured hot gravy into it last Thanksgiving, the glass went flying everywhere as it broke right in my hand! Admittedly, that was an older one and perhaps the newer glass versions are more rugged when it comes to heat. But I just don\u0027t have that worry using a plastic one.

Although I do feel that it\u0027s a little flimsy to be called a \"professional\" product, and seeing as how I\u0027ve worked in the food industry my whole life, I feel validated in saying that. However, I have used it for a while now, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. From soft to crisp waffles in a short amount of time, any easy to use and clean. My ony complaint is that it\u0027s rather large for the size of my kitchen. Excellent waffles! Thick and golden, like in the user submitted photos. I\u0027ve never had waffles so good, not even in a restaurant. The true Belgian waffle recipes do take a bit of patience and know-how, but they\u0027re worth the effort.

Two things I have noticed about this appliance...I have 3 kids and a husband that all love the waffles, so when we use it I am making a lot of waffles.  If it starts to appear the waffles are getting more crisp, dial down the heat setting one less than what you are currently set on.  We start out with a \"4\" setting.  I am in the habit of spritzing the grids EVERY time we bake a waffle.  If you miss between, the waffles don\u0027t stick, but it is apparent they don\u0027t slip right out as easy.  I have found that a butter flavored cooking spray gives the waffle more of a \"restaurant\" taste.  We use the box batters...there is no way in hell I would take the time to make the book mix...LOL.  I\u0027ve used more expensive mixes to store brand mixes ($1.99/box) and they all bake up great.  \n\nMy mom has the same unit and she pretty much echos everything I have said.  They will make extras and freeze them.  We never have extras at our house--LOL!\n\nI have decided to keep my waffler out on the counter, it looks very sleek next to my beautiful staninless Kitchenaid mixer, stainless rice cooker and stainless coffee maker.  And, I admit it, I throw all the mix into the mixer and let the mixer do the job for me.  \n\nClean up is a snap and we have enjoyed having this appliance.  BE SURE TO HAND WASH THE BATTER CUP if you don\u0027t want the writing to come off.  I have scratched mine with an ice pick to show the proper level.  Also, I have a small spatula on hand I use to spread the thicker mixes around (quickly) if need be.  I also hand wash the tray and just let air dry and wipe up the unit after each use.\n\nI just can\u0027t justify taking the entire family out to breakfast for $30-40 when we can make all the goodies at home.  We are also planning a suprise waffle bake for my son\u0027s teacher at school for his birthday with my waffler.  I will just pre-mix a ton of batter.\n\nWe have a family friend who we owe a belated wedding gift to and this is what we are going to get them.  I know they will enjoy it too.\n\nHappy cooking\n",

    "\nThe Black plastic looks a little odd.  It\u0027s not glossy like the picture.  It doesn\u0027t look really clean even after you clean it is the only way I can discribe it.  I bought 2 of these for the office to replace our old ones because we burnt a Pop Tart and the rest of the building was less that thrilled that the Fire Department had to respond. This one is suppose to shut down if something gets stuck in it.  Good Idea.  But, the instructions still say not to cook Pop Tarts unattended anyway.  Now they tell us.  There is a toaster with a Pop Tart Logo, the Toastmaster 2035.  If you want a laugh, read the review for that one.  Bottom line, for the money, this toaster works great.  I like the lift feature a lot.  But, I\u0027d buy the white next time\n",
    "\nYes, it\u0027s rather uncomely - it\u0027s outer casing is obviously plastic and, ours at least, doesn\u0027t have that same sheen as the example.  It does look cheap.  THAT being said, it\u0027s a VERY functional toaster.  We\u0027ve had NO problems in six+ months with variability - we know what we\u0027re going to get when we drop the lever.  The plastic exterior DOES STAY COOL.  So cool, in fact, that I promise you, you will forget normal toaster safety and burn yourself on the small exposed metal at the top.  Yep, this is a GREAT toatser for someone who wants a functioning toaster and doesn\u0027t mind that it\u0027s an ugly duckling.  An EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY\n",

    "\nI totally love these pans... Next go round I would definately order more of the same,, as I am hard on frying pans, and love these immensel\n",
    "\nI had bought the larger set in BLUE and ordered these pans in BLUE as well. Thinking that they would match the pieces I already owned, I was quite disappointed when I received BLACK instead of the BLUE I ordered. I returned them and Amazon replaced them with another set of BLACK pans. I decided to keep them but am quite upset, with my only alternative being to return them for credit.\n\nKeep in mind that these are NOT the heavy Stainless Steel, but the lighter weight ALUMINUM. You will NOT be able to mistreat\nthese pans by turning the flame up on full. To do so will cause\nthe pans to warp.\n\nThe advantage to these pans is that they are LIGHTWEIGHT and easy\nto handle. I definitely recommend them.\n \nAs with all TEFLON coated pans, be sure to use the PLASTIC\nutensils and NEVER use any metal spoons or turners or you will\nruin the Teflon surface. With a little care these will last for\nyears!\n\nTIP: If you\u0027re having trouble with the bottom of your pots and\npans getting a scorched or burnt look, it\u0027s from GREASE. When\nyou wash your pans, make sure all the grease is cleaned off of\nthe outside bottom of the pans\n",
    "\nI bought one of these muffin pans because I was excited at the prospect of owning a piece of bakeware whose lining wasn\u0027t destroyed by the 3rd time I wanted to use it. For that alone, I would give this item 5 stars.\n\nI am not an experienced baker, but I think that after reading the other review for this item that more balanced comments need to be stated regarding the actual use of this muffin pan.\n\nSo here are my comments:\n\n1. You need to use a cookie sheet (or something similar) to support the pan since it is flexible.\n\n2. The muffins cook faster than with a metal pan.\n\n3. The muffins seem small if you fill the cups as you would with a metal muffin pan - you can actually fill them up all the way. (Recall that I am not an experienced baker; as an engineer I suspect that since the muffins cook differently, i.e. faster, this could be compensated by adjusting the batter in some manner. As far I\u0027m concerned as long as the muffins taste good, it doesn\u0027t matter to me.)\n\n4. The coating is not exactly non-stick. You do not need to grease the pan, but you do need to be careful when it comes time to remove the muffins. I use the dull side of table knife to separate the muffin sides from the pan (while gently pulling the pan). After doing that I put a plate on top of the muffin pan and  hold it against the pan as I invert the pan. All I have to do then is tap the bottoms of the muffin cups to get them out. By my third time doing this I was able to get them all out intact and unscathed.\n\nI am very happy with my muffin pan - it might take a little bit of getting used to for someone used to other pans - but for me, the benefit of not having a cheap non-stick coating peeling off of the metal after a year more than compensates for a slight learning curve on the use\n",

    "\nNot much you would need a food processor for after you buy this (ok, it can\u0027t blend ingredients\n",
    "\nI bought the Omega 8002 Juicer on the recommendation of Dr. Joseph Mercola, a holistic health MD who has a popular newsletter and website. We met him at a health fair, tried vegetable juices (including wheatgrass juice) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet. I mean, how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day? Not so much. \n\nThe Omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 RPMs, a powerful, slow auger that doesn\u0027t heat up the food or cause the juice to foam. This protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation. In addition, it is \"multifunctional\"--the juicer can also be employed to make baby food, meat pate, nut butter, or fine ground coffee. The machine is durable, said to be quiet, and has a 10-year guarantee. Sounds good, so we plunked down the cash and got the Omega juicer and set to work. \n\nSo, how is it to USE the Omega? Well, it\u0027s EASY to put together, though there are quite a few parts and choices to make. Essentially, the steps are:\n\n1. Install the screw drive--the big green plastic spiral, into the plastic housing.\n2. Pop a juicing cone (a type of sieve) over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw. This takes a bit of jockeying, but it drops in just fine. \n3. Screw on the end cap and nozzle.\n4. Mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor.\n5. Add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing.\n6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice.\n\nNow it\u0027s ready to start juicing.  \n \n1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise. \n\n2. Turn on the motor: it has a forward direction to drive the food OUT, and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog. I\u0027ve never needed to do this.\n\n3. Push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer. The food feeds along the screw, is broken up, and the juice is forced through the sieve (cone.) Out the nozzle comes the pulp. The juice flows out underneath, nearer to the motor. \n\n4. When you are finished, turn off the motor, which is QUITE quiet--nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner. More like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor, for comparison. Dismantle the machine and wash the parts. A big bottle brush is included for this, very helpful.\n\n5. Cleanup takes about 2-3 minutes and is mainly rinsing. The worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn\u0027t take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it. I do this ASAP, as I sip my juice, because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean. I then reassemble it right then and there, and it\u0027s ready to go again.\n\nThe Omega juices kale, which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage.  We now can do wheatgrass, once we grow some or find a source of flats of it. \n\nJust for grins, I tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding. It makes a fine grind--not something you\u0027d use for hamburger. It would work for soft, somewhat grainy baby food or pate. I did not try making pasta. \n\nHow does it compare to spinning cup type models, like the Braun which we previously used for juicing?\n\n1. The spinning cup model (Braun) is LOUD, really loud. This is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result. This is typical for the cup-type juicer. Sounds like a blender.  \n\n2. The cup model cannot juice wheatgrass--the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants. It also can\u0027t do tough leafy vegetables such as kale.\n\n3. The cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the Omega. The pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry. The pulp from the Omega, by contrast, is like slightly moistened sawdust--definitely drier.\n\nIn summary, the Omega juicer, while pricier than the typical spinning cup models, is quiet and effective. It gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can\u0027t handle, like wheatgrass and if you want, meat. It extracts more juice--and at the prices for produce these days, especially if you buy organic produce, this is an important benefit. The juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use. If you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods, I would say, this is a model to strongly consider over others. The performance and added functionality well repay the higher price\n",
    "\nPerhaps like you, I love silicone.  You can do anything with silicone.  You can fry, poach, make soups, and there is never a worry about heat.  Le Crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils, but their wood is unfinished, so unless you keep them oiled, they will age and spilter.  These you can remove the top if you like but the wooden handles are treated, and are water resistant.  \n\nIn addition to these being made for the long hall, their shape is unique.  I like that the shape is slightly angled, this makes it easier to run along the edges of a bowl.  I  have been so happy with my purchase of these!  I can\u0027t say enough good things about them.  I would recommend these over other manufactors, they are better made, and improve in others weaker areas.  A must have for your kitchen\n",
    "\nLove the functionality - being able to separate for different uses esp. meat and that they flex to enable direct frop into the pan. But mine came off color (sorta transparent) at the corners (and this wasn\u0027t a deisgn feaure since there was no pattern in all the four sheets) but still good value - not worth exchanging so I kept them. I guess mine look unique\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve had 2 sets of these simple but marvelous mats so far, not only the handiest thing I\u0027ve bought for my kitchen, but friends keep talking me into giving them one. I only need one or two but one is always on my countertop for various uses the past few years.\n\nI\u0027m a senior lady and disabled, and my time standing in the kitchen is limited so I hate cleaning up messes, picking up dropped stuff on the floor, sterilizing unweildy wood or plastic cutting boards. Mainly love the ease of chopping or slicing vegies on it, folding it over like a funnel and dumping right into a salad bowl or a pan with NO SPILLS, or vegies onto another can\u0027t do without item, faithful George Foreman Grill, beside my meat entree. Top down, vegies and meat dinner in 4 minutes.\n\nSo simple to just put under the faucet and run hot water over it, or wipe with a little bleach on a sponge. Very few knife marks on mine, but I don\u0027t like super sharp knives, and if I seldom have to cut meat I use a scissors and wax paper on the mat to then wrap and freeze pieces. I buy boneless skinless chicken or pork or sirloin chops. The grill gets a once over with a damp paper towel. So simple and time saver, not like cuts on a wooden board which is most unsanitary. \n\nBeyond a slicing surface, great for placing cannisters on to fill with coffee or sugar, salt shakers, or stuff I seem to always have to spill some, shakey hands at 70. Just roll it up, shake in the trash or sink disposal, rinse if necessary and reuse, keeps counter clean and free of stains. I put hot or cold things on it to protect the formica, made a few stains with coffee but cleans with bleach ok, not ruining my counter top. They wear well but at the price, and the work they save they can be tossed for another new one. Best features are flexible enough to roll and empty, easy cleanup forget the broom, and no storage problem in my cramped space - stack them on the counter and peel top one off for next job.\n\nBesides these mats and the elec non stick grill, my micro rice steamer is the third CDW to make food preparation easier than ever in my life. If I spill dry rice filling it, roll and dump in the cooker. I am not kitchen friendly, want to spend as little time on my feet as possible, hate to cook, hate cleaning up, dinner in 6 minutes and I\u0027m done. \n\nSo glad to see these are on the web, had a hard time finding more in stores when I want to gift someone. If you want the job done clean and fast, tired of bending picking up rollaway strays off the floor (or always between stove and counter narrow space) buy these for a staple in a kitchen, especially for seniors - I\u0027ve no dishwasher nor disposal I might add. Why in the world would one need a cutting board heat resistant? not for oven or stovetop use. For glue guns and crafts which I also do, put a piece of wax paper over your extra mat if you want to protect a table top, I use one on my desk and serves as a coaster too. I didn\u0027t even know about the silicone part, who cares. \n\nJust can\u0027t rave enough over these. Saves work, saves time\n",

I couldn\u0027t even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together. Fortunately, the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately. I received my second new processor, and tried to make cookies. This time, everything worked fine, and the machine is quiet. I can even talk on the phone when using this food processor.

Once I manage to wrangle it out from the cupboard and heft it onto the stove, it\u0027s many uses range from cooking chickens, small turkeys, and roasts to making potato leek soup.  The beautiful thing is that it really retains heat and cooks items thoroughly and evenly.  The downside is that it can take a while to heat up, especially since it should heat up on a med-low setting so as not to burn items and/or damage the porcelain.  Learned this the hard way by turning up my soup to med-hi in order to get it boiling more quickly (doh!).  Now that we know how to properly use this type of cookware, we are enjoying it much more!  Another clever use of this piece is to incorporate it into your weight lifting routine (did I mention this thing is very VERY heavy?).

It\u0027s not much louder than most microwave ovens and it\u0027s far less likely to burn the popcorn. Only one minor complaint: butter doesn\u0027t really melt completely in the cup on top (make sure you have melted butter ready to go if you want it). An on/off switch might\u0027ve been nice but that\u0027s not a big deal unless you want to keep it on your countertop permanently.

    "\nI am so in love with my new machine.  Many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality.  I received my machine really quickly and that\u0027s saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification.  Speaking of gratification, I could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine.  All the reviews are true. It\u0027s perfect, once you read the instructions or perhaps do as I did, get a walk-thru from the wonderful folks at DeLonghi customer support, you will be up and running in no time.  You can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care (read the instructions) will last a very long time.  The espressos I\u0027ve made so far are supreme, even my 14 year old loved a weak one I made for him; and it\u0027s so easy after set-up to use.  It could not be any simpler.  Who would not love this machine?  There was one website that was charging $1200 for the same machine.  I could not believe my eyes.  The only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine.  I really could not see what he was talking about.  It has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam (it makes very creamy foam) it will increase the volume 2-3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk.  But there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother.  They had me worried when I read that but the frother does its thing with total ease.  Even a caveman could do it.  You stick it in the milk and turn the switch and, voila!, it\u0027s frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and can\u0027t accomodate the foam it creates.  All in All, this is a top notch buy and a guilty pleasure for sure and nothing could be more gratifying then having merchandise that lives up to its promise.  This machine delivers, I love it and so will you\n",

    "\nThis tabletop fan is a telling reason why Vornado has been around for a long time.  Great air output, high quality, well-built, very quiet on low speed, adjustable so you can tilt it at any angle you want, and just small enough to fit on your desk, table, or in our case, the bathroom counter.  My wife uses this fan to cool off in the bathroom while getting ready in the morning, and it really does the job.  It has a very focused air flow so she can aim it on herself without bothering me.  It\u0027s very smooth running, so there\u0027s no danger of it vibrating off the counter.  It costs a bit more than the typical portable fan, but then there\u0027s nothing more frustrating than having a fan that won\u0027t cool you off.  No worries with this one!  The extra money is well spent here.  This fan lives up to the saying, \"You get what you pay for\"\n",
    "\nWe originally bought the product for our toddler\u0027s room and then ended up buying a second Vornado for our master bedroom.  This is an excellent buy for several reasons. First, it is sleek and stylish, especially given its neutral color.  Second, it provides a great wind speed given its small size.  Third, it provides a constant soothing wind sound, which is great for drowning out any annoying pheripheral noises.

    "\nI ordered this the early part of December, so had it in time for the Christmas season.  I am so very pleasantly surprised about the power and efficiency of this one.  It is small so storage is a breeze, and the capacity of the bowl is just right for any chopping, etc. that you need to do.  This is my \u0026quot;new favorite\u0026quot; appliance\n",
    "\nThis food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen.  For salsas, the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky. For sauces, the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients. My favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears.  The large bowl not only holds alot, but is also very  easy to clean. I highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook\n",

    "\nAfter suffering for years with blade grinders and cheaper burr grinders, I decided to take the plunge and get the Capresso Infinity in brushed chrome. This grinder addresses all the problems I had with the lesser machines: it\u0027s fairly quiet, free of static, grinds evenly, and is easy to clean (although unless you use really oily beans, you shouldn\u0027t need to clean it very often). \n\nI don\u0027t make espresso, but I\u0027ve used it to grind coffee for moka pots, French press, and drip coffeemakers, all with great success.\n\nJust a note on its construction: the difference between the chrome versions and the ABS plastic version is more than just the finish or a metal skin. The chrome versions have a \"zinc die-cast housing,\" weigh almost twice as much as the ABS plastic version, and are very stable.\n\nAlso, as usual, Amazon has inflated the price to make it seem like they\u0027re offering us a bargain when they\u0027re not. The list price on the manufacturer\u0027s website is $139.99, not $190. I got mine locally at Sur la Table\n",
    "\nI was helped in choosing this pizza stone by the hundreds of online reviews and suggestions posted by people from all over. Well, they were all right. Excellent item. I bought two stones and used them simultaneously for the first two homemade pizzas of my life... DELICIOUS! As others have suggested, I never remove the stone from the oven, and lately I just placed a pan containing the dough for an olive focaccia and it came out perfectly done. I am convinced that the stone works its magic also when not used to bake directly on it. I am extremely happy so far and I\u0027d highly recommend this item. Buon Appetito\n",

It was amaing how this cleaner got everything thing clean.\n\nThere was a large bad stain area due to a plate of hot food was dropped and all the oils from the cooking and butter was dumped on the carpet. I tried everything to remove it, nothing would get the stains out. When I used this Steam Cleaner on it, Guess What all the stains had been removed.\n\nI really do think it has something to do with the brush action and the fact that it heats up the water, plus it also gives out equal amount of soap and water.\n\nI would also add that I have used this on our furniture and it worked just as good as it did one the carpet \nI have recommended this machine to all my friends, it is worth the money Plus.\n\nI also have a small Steam Cleaner from the same company it is perfect for the Rec Room and pet accidents on the carpet\n",

    "\nTo prevent scratches and chipping and to retain Fiesta\u0027s smooth glossy surface, hand wash separately, one piece at a time, in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates (cups between coffee filters).  I do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new. A friend gave me all her brown dripware (Gourmet) from 1969 and the place settings are scratched, pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing.  Mine from the same era are still glossy, mostly scratch free, and certainly not pitted. Also, I don\u0027t put my original pieces in my microwave, (only hers) because although it may be safe to do so, this can dull a glossy finish.  Re Fiestaware, I remember seeing relatives and neighbors Fiesta cups \u0026 plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and \"cheap\"- looking, perhaps because of the dull rose, gray, and avacado colors at the time. However,I find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and,so far, have bought Heather,Seamist, Scarlett, Tangerine, Turquoise, and yellow. Cobalt, Cinnebar, and Plum are just too dark and dreary for me.  In the store, they are much darker than they look on here. In a library book on fiestaware, they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color (like the fruit) would be bright/pretty, too.\n",
    "\nThis is a great set of dinnerware!! After 25 years, my husband and I decided to bring some color into our lives by replacing our wedding gift white Corelle with festive FiestaWare.

And it can be put in the dishwasher, microwave, oven and freezer!!! It may cost a bit more than some of the trendy stuff available, but it\u0027s adaptability to all uses makes it a fabulous value!!! If you are at all tempted by it --- BUY IT!!!! You will LOVE it! Put some color in your life\n",
    "\nI have never had any problems using this pan.  The key is to use a recipe for French bread or baguettes, not just any bread recipe.  I use a bread machine dough cycle to prepare the dough, because I\u0027m just not talented at breadmaking.  The French bread recipe in the machine\u0027s owner\u0027s manual worked fine, and so did a French bread recipe in a bread machine cookbook.  I think other doughs are too soft and get into the holes, as other reviewers have noted.  They didn\u0027t prepare the right kind of bread dough.\n\nI\u0027m a whiz at using the bread machine dough cycle, then finishing baking rustic breads in a baguette or French bread pan.  It\u0027s no fail!  It makes me look like an expert bread baker.\n\nTrust me, I\u0027m not...if I try making bread without the machine\u0027s help, I end up with bricks.  LOL  The Chicago Metallic baguette pan is easy to use and results in a crusty, chewy bread.  Lovely\n",
    "\nI received this knife as a Christmas present and so far, I am pleased. What struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is. I also own a Wusthoff Santoku (which I love, too) and this knife was just as sharp right out of the box as the Wusthoff was. It is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action, which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables. It is also wonderful for carving meats, with its long sharp blade. The blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes, however, but is certainly functional. The grip is also slightly larger than I would like, making it a bit more cumbersome to hold than my Wusthoff. But these matters are not that important considering the price of this knife. If price were not an issue and I had to choose between a Wusthoff and a Forschner Fibrox, then I would probably choose a Wusthoff. But being that a Wusthoff of this size would be at least $50 more, then price does come to play. If money is no object, then choose the wonderful German steel of a Wusthoff or look into the Japanese steel of a Shun. But if you are like most of us and have to consider price, then I do believe you will be happy with a Forschner Fibrox Chef\u0027s Knife.\n",

    "\n I\u0027ve used a pair of Emperor 400 filters on a 75 gallon tank continuously for the past five years or so. So far, neither has needed attention other than filter changes and recently, new impellers. After five years, the constantly spinning impellers had worn their shafts and bushings to the point where they made a rattley noise, although they still moved water effectively. Replacing the impellers was an easy repair, and restored the unit to almost total silence. The filter may actually now be quieter than when it was new, as there appeared to be a slight design change in the new impellers when compared to the old ones. \n\nI\u0027m still using the original biowheels, with no end in sight. For almost anyone, a single Emperor would provide adequate filtration, however at the time I purchased them, I had seven huge goldfish in the tank, who produced vast quantities of waste matter. Eventually the goldfish grew too large for the tank and were relocated to a pond in the backyard, and the tank was restocked with a variety of colorful tropical fish.\n\n The big selling feature for the Emperor 400 is the dual biowheels, which provides a highly oxygenated living space for beneficial bacteria to colonize. These bacteria help remove some of the waste products which the fish produce, resulting in healthier fish, and extending the time interval between water changes, and thus reducing maintainence of the aquarium. Other filters have alternative methods of providing biological filtration, but the biowheel is so effective that it can keep nitrates at an undetectable level.\n\n These filters are made of a black, slightly flexible plastic which seems to be less brittle than the transparant material used on some other filters. As others have mentioned, each filter has four slots for filter cartridges. And the filter comes with two refillable media containers which can occupy two of those slots, if you choose to use them. Then can hold extra carbon, zeolite, or other material. I have mine filled with porous ceramic noodles.\n\n The Emperor 400 has a control for water volume, so you can turn it down when feeding your fish, preventing all the food from being sucked into the filter. After the fish have finished eating, the volume can be set back to \"high\", however I have left it in the second slowest postion for weeks at a time, and the fish seemed to be content. I have found that if the volume control is not moved for a long time, it tends to accumulate mineral deposits and become stiff. So, I turn it down every day when feeding, then turn it back up a couple of hours later. Also, if the power is interrupted while water volume is turned down, the filter takes longer to prime itself and begin pumping properly. If power fails when volume is turned up, the filter restarts with no problem when power is restored.  \n\n The Emperor 400 comes with a cleaning brush for the spray bars and an extension for the water intake to be used if you have a very deep tank. My own tank is fairly deep, and the extension would bring the intake nearer the bottom, however I don\u0027t use the extension, and filtration seem fine.\n\n When setting up an aquarium, it should be born in mind that the closer to a natural habitat you can get, the healthier your fish will be and the less maintainence will be required. My own tank is set up as follows:\n\n Two inches of \"Eco-Complete planted aquarium substrate\" soil purchased in sealed bags at the local store AquariumConnection. The soil is intended for use in aquariums with live plants, which feed on some of the wastes. In the soil, there are approximately 20 Anubis plants scattered around the tank. The fish love to swim between and around the leaves, or hide behind them. From time to time, eggs are laid on the leaves of the plants. The bright green leaves stand out in vivid contrast against the nearly black soil. Two 15 watt fluorescent lights provide illumination to stimulate photsynthesis in the plants.\n\n I strongly recommend that you do NOT use any type of gravel, colored or otherwise, as food falls down into the gravel where fish cannot reach it, and where it rots and fouls the water. If you choose to use gravel, you MUST vacuum the gravel on a weekly basis, and your water still will not be as clean. Gravel equals more work and dirtier water. Sand is better than gravel as food cannot fall down into the sand, but sand still doesn\u0027t provide nutrition for live plants. Use Eco-Complete soil or something comparable, both you and your fish will be happier. \n\n I also recommend that you do NOT use any type of undergravel filter, as these will also require frequent vacuuming, and eventual dismantling of the tank to clean beneath the filter plate. With the Emperor, you won\u0027t need additional filters. And again, undergravel filters equal more work and lower water quality. I NEVER vacuum the soil, and perform a 20% water change every couple of months, usually when I change filter cartridges. \n\n The fish themselves consist of a number of cory catfish, who snuffle around through the soil and pick up whatever falls from above. There are as well golden tetras, cardinal tetras, redline tetras, silver dollars, danios, flying clouds, and mollies, and one otocinclus catfish. Some of the cory catfish are grandfathers several times over, and have grown to a large size in the five years or so they have lived in this tank.\n\n I feed them once each day, around 6:00 pm. Supper consists of several spirulina wafers, plus a pinch of flake food about the size of a nickle, which I crush between my fingers to produce many very fine particles.\n\n To sum up, the Emperor 400 is an efficient and durable filter which will help provide good water quality and healthy fish.\n",

I used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn-on-the-cob, but since no steam escapes here, I can make several batches non-stop.  I also like the fact that the steamer is wide; that means that the food will cook evenly (instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked).  I\u0027ve only used the steamer five or six times but so far, there\u0027s practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness, but I\u0027m more interested in function than appearance.  Washing it immediately will keep it stain-free.  Overall, an incredible deal for $20.00\n",

    "\nFrom the review of this CA King and the review of the King, these comforter\u0027s sizes are off only in design. I have a CA King and the CA King actually fits my bed great overall.

If I pull the comforter down so that the ruffle part starts at the foot of my bed, it hangs a little low and I have about 10 inches at the head of my bed uncovered.\nThe comforter is absolutely gorgeous and seems to be quality made.

I couldn\u0027t wait to use it.  I just wanted to get those little grill marks on my food, because I don\u0027t own an outdoor grill and I don\u0027t like the idea of dealing with mosquitos while grilling outside.  Not only did I get the marks, but I got the burnt grill flavor on my chicken breast, too.   The first night that I used it, I was having a dinner party while cooking.  It performed stellar on the first use.  I used chicken breast strips and noticed that though they seared with that great sound, they were cooking evenly and slowly.  The food didn\u0027t burn, but I had to cook it a long time to get the chicken thoroughly done.  The taste was perfect and not burnt or dry at all.  I was so excited that I cooked whole bonely breast two days later and can\u0027t wait to grill the shrimp and vegetables this weekend.  Beware though, the thickness of the meat will cause a lengthy grilling time.  So, the house will be full of smoke (for the inexperienced cook like me), but the meat will not burn or dry out.  I also purchased the heart shape pot which was great for display of the casserole but the grill pan has me walking on cloud nine.  Matter of fact, I\u0027m eating grilled chicken for lunch right now and it taste great!\n",

I happened on the slicer while browsing amazon and could not believe they had such a tool! I ordered it right then and it arrived in a few days. All that was said about it is really true! It cuts a pineapple in a matter of seconds leaving a very attractive bowel, the pinapple it self\n",
    "\nHi,\nWe got this set one month after getting married, and guess what, it is the thing that we always wanted. It gives us the choices in pan sizes. and there are three more mixing bowls which come handy while cooking or storing left overs. The stockpots are wonderful, they are the used  most of the times. The mirror polish is still intact, I think this is a wonderful thing that a newly wed should  have. Its worth the price.\n\nPositive points: Food doesn\u0027t stick to the pots/pans\nYou get varieties of sizes.\nEasy to clean.\nLooks smart.\n\n\nNegative points: I feel the handles are little delicate, so we have to give support if the stockpot is completely filled \nThe mixing bowls are quite thin. Be careful while dumping it into sin\n",

    "\nI agree with most of the positive reviews of the VacuVin Food Saver set. However, I\u0027d love a larger size--one that could hold at least one pound of ground coffee. I suppose the downside would be that it would take longer to pump the air out of a larger container. But, they\u0027re easy to use, look nice, and keep the food fresher longer. \n\nReview update: 05/03/2005 One Star\n2 of the containers won\u0027t hold a seal any longer. Not recommended for the long term.\n",
    "\nThis was my first \u0027nice\u0027 knife when I was taken in by the Santoku craze, and it was certainly a decent choice.  The knife is sharp out of the box, reasonably well balanced, and has pretty good fit/finish.  For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless/skinless chicken, etc., that are largely prepared, this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work.  The real drawback is the length.  When you live in the South, you see vidalia onions that are 7\" in diameter.  This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies.  And don\u0027t even think about getting it near hard melons or bone-in meats.  Since I got this knife, I\u0027ve expanded my collection quite a bit, even adding some real Japanese steel.  But this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip, where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife can\u0027t get me to relinquish the big blade.  For most cooks, who need a real omni-tasker knife, I would look for a 9-10\" chef\u0027s knife rather than this. \n",
    "\nThis listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the Ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes Corelle has recently released.  This is fabulous because I was concerned that the old Corelle I remember is a bit thin. These carry a 5-year warranty vs. the regular 3-yr.\n\nThis pattern is more beautiful in person; the leaves have a great texture to them. The pattern is softer and less \"limey\" in person (in a good way). Don\u0027t shy away from Corelle because they aren\u0027t known for style (I almost did). The durability and beauty of these dishes are unmatched in my opinion.  Purchased two sets for special occassion dinners and everyday use\n",

    "\nThis cooking/serving stainless steel slotted spoon, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you\u0027ll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.\nIts elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to use either in the kitchen or at the dinner table, and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and a strong, stout neck guaranteed to be unbendable.\nOverall, this spoon is perfect to strain vegetables, fruits, shrimp and other foods, and its easy to clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. Furthermore, its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away. \nAfter submitting this product to over three years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new.\n--Reviewed by Maritza Volma\n",

Being a product that has one model made by one manufacturer, I was very surprised to find the battery at a significantly lower price at Amazon. The product works as one would expect, it charged right up and it runs my Roomba, as long as it doesn\u0027t blow up like a laptop battery, I will continue to enjoy a product that makes my life a little easier. Now if they could come up with a robot that washes and folds laundry, now that would be a \"must have\" product\n",

    "\nThis is a wonderfully efficient zesting tool. If you find that you need a zester more than even once a year you should invest in this nifty little product. It boasts solid construction with an easy grip rubberized handle and 5 sharp holes for quick and easy zesting. Very easy to hold and twist when zesting. It even has a little channel knife if you want to do some fancy peeling. This beats the heck out of trying to zest with a cheap grater type device and is vastly superior to trying to zest with the edge of a knife. (As I did for years before I learned better) I use lemon and lime zest quite a bit more than the average person and I see no signs that this tool will dull, break, or wear out anytime soon. Highly recommended tool for any active zester. As easy to wash as a fork. Cool\n",

    "\nThis is a premier baking sheet at a fraction of the cost.  Made of commercial grade materials, it delivers quality nearly every time.   I have made many different foods on these sheets, including fish sticks, cookies, meats and roasted potatoes.  It works great with everyone, and there is no transfer ever.  Browning is even and consistent, and I personally haven\u0027t yet had one warp at high temps and I have 4 of them.  \n\nThey are a standard size, and could be too big for some small ovens.  I ran into this when I needed to visit a friend\u0027s home and do baking, and they didn\u0027t fit into her wall oven.  Not really Chicago Metallic\u0027s fault, just something to watch out for\n",

    "\nIf you have a good cook (or chef) in the family, this makes a very impressive gift.  It\u0027s a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking.\n\nMy only criticism of it is the lack of a non-stick interior.  You either will want to line the pan with foil before cooking anything that will generate a mess or where juices might burn, or you\u0027ll have to let it soak with a dryer sheet for a while afterwards.  The stainless doesn\u0027t retain messes so much as it just takes a bit of effort to get it completely clean.  But it\u0027s worth the effort - the pan cooks evenly, the rack is very sturdy.\n\nWorth the money.\n\nWatch out for the handles when they\u0027re hot - they don\u0027t fold down and it\u0027s easy to burn the underside of your arm or hands on them when you\u0027re moving it around while hot.\n\n",
    "\nThis roasting pan is a prize and well worth the investment. It is heavy duty and I have used it for large rib roasts and a turkey.  It is wonderful for making gravy on my gas stove after roasting; the rack is so sturdy it holds any roast I could fit in my oven.  It washes clean with little effort so I have not had to use the dishwasher.  It looks like new after washing.  This pan will be around a lot longer than I will! \n",
    "\nAs advertised, and described in various reviews, the blender is solid, powerful and loud....very loud. I have to block my ears when it\u0027s running but I had expected that so I\u0027m not complaining.

It\u0027s very easy to set up the timer and looks great sitting on the counter.

I have other measuring cups, but these are the ones I reach for over and over. Very convenient - no bending - I love it! Ingenious! My only criticism - and it\u0027s very minor - is that the design of the handle makes it wobble slightly rather than sitting firmly on a flat surface. If they correct this minor design flaw, it would get five stars\n",
    "\nWe wanted to rid our kitchen of the microwave for health reasons but still have a fast way to get hot water. I never dreamed any small appliance could be this great.

    "\nI love my Donvier! I got it as a gift a number of years ago and won\u0027t let it out of my kitchen. Just last night, I made an impromtu batch of ice cream for a guest, using some over-ripe strawberries in the refrigerator. But once we got started we also added a banana and some pecans, first blended in the blender. The end result was scrumptuous.\n\nIce Cream making can be SOOOO easy with this little gadget. My grandchildren love for me to get it out. What a tasty treat! Who doesn\u0027t love home-made ice cream, especially when you can see it being made, or better still, help make it.\n\nKeep the inner core in your freezer and the lightweight plastic outer container in a bottom cabinet. No mess, no fuss, no problem.\n\nIf you like ice cream and want a simple way of making it, this Donvier is the answer. Buy one. No, buy two and give one away. If I had not gotten mine as a gift, I might never have known the pleasure.\n\nGail Gupton, Author: \u0027The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment\u0027, and \u0027Seekers of Truth\u0027.\n",

    "\nLodge makes great products at a great price. This Dutch oven has been in  constant use since we bought it in January -- potatoes, chops, stews,  popcorn, whatever. It does it all. The \u0026quot;nonstick\u0026quot; surface works  as advertised, the inside of the pot is easy to clean and the handle is  industrial strength. Only complaint: The lid can be hard to clean because  of its little spikes on the inside. Check out the great Sprite soda pop  potato recipe they provide with the instructions\n",
    "\nNordic Ware makes the best looking pans, but this is my favorite pan from Nordic Ware!  This pan makes beautiful breads and cakes.  Because it has a  non-stick coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher  setting when baking.

    "\nWe had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50, when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single-cup brewer. I confess - I coveted this new machine in a big way. So when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new B70 last week on our front stoop, it was very much like Christmas for me. My wife just smiled, and the kids gave out a sincere, \"Whoa, that\u0027s cool!\" at our new kitchen friend.\n\nEverything that we liked about the B50 is there for the B70 - with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel. The coffee just tastes good, first and foremost. I\u0027ve tasted cups from other single-serve brewers, and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop-the-cup coffee. From my first experience with the Keurig machines, however, I was amazed how good the brew tasted. The home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot, or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine\u0027s brew basket got finicky. The additional My K-cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans, too - so as a coffee snob, I\u0027m hooked.\n\nThe Platinum B70 adds selection for cup size - right now, I think our best default size is 9.25oz, filling out most travel mugs and our normal in-house mugs well without getting watery on the k-cups we\u0027ve tried so far. And it has a larger reservoir for water, meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink. All of these things would be enough, right?\n\nBut wow, it is just so cool looking. The blue LED lights that make the water glow on the left, and the blue LCD screen on the right that shows the clock, menu, cup selection, and the chrome fixtures - even the spring-loaded holder in the front top of the brewer - all of that combines to make it more than just a good coffee, taking us into the realm of a really cool experience. The kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen, seeing Daddy\u0027s glowing blue coffee brewer, just wanting to marvel in its glow.... okay, that\u0027s a little too melodramatic, but only slightly.\n\nIf you like coffee and spend more than $10 per day, or throw away more than a third of a pot of coffee each morning, or if you enjoy coffee but avoid making it at night because for just one cup that whole pot will go to waste - I think you owe it to yourself to try this brewer out. Not just in the store, but blue and glowing in your own kitchen. Trust me - \"Merry Christmas\" is a great feeling\n",
    "\nWhen my sons cordless died he went an bought this phone system for himself so that he could keep one in his room and another in his office (located in separate areas of the home).  after he let it charge overnight we tested it out and were ammazed with it it could work inside outside all the way to the mailbox with no/little static!!!

    "\nI am very pleased with this lightweight, inexpensive teakettle.

    "\nI just needed to refute that first review also. This is not a toy, it\u0027s not for mixing your ovaltine or slimfast shakes (though it will work for SURE). I assume that\u0027s what the first reviewer wanted it for. You can get a 19 dollar piece to do that. It\u0027s not \"about a foot long!\" It\u0027s 17 inches, and needs to be. It\u0027s also not 20 lbs. It\u0027s 2 lbs. and it\u0027s weight is perfect. It\u0027s not a \"hand blender\" for mixing water. It\u0027s an IMMERSION blender for making the thickest of the thick and the creamiest of the creamiest as far as soups go and 50 other uses.

    "\nI feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the \"misguided\" reviewer who likened it to a jack-hammer.  That review gave me pause when I was considering ordering it.  Fortunately I had faith in Amazon\u0027s return policy and decided to give it a chance.  It\u0027s not at all too heavy or too large.  I\u0027m 5\u0027 3\" with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly.  It really is ergonomically designed.  The power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it.  You have no need to change your grip until you\u0027re through blending--which is next to no time.  It blends thoroughly and efficiently.  It does have enough weight to give you some control.  You wouldn\u0027t want something this powerful to be too light--it could just fly out of your grasp.  This feels solid, is very attractive, and also appears to be very well made.  I love it. If you think you might want an immersion blender (and if you cook, you do) you\u0027ll love it too.\n  \nIt should be noted that this is also called an immersion blender. I was confused by the two designations--hand blender/immersion blender.  Apparently they are the same thing although listed separately\n",

It generally toasts the bread evenly, and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next.  It doesn\u0027t seem that slow to me, but my expectations may differ from yours.  I agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing, but we just leave it on the four-slice setting.  I also agree it is a bit pricey, but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently.  Perhaps Cuisinart has a quality control problem, but we wouldn\u0027t hesitate to buy another one.  Good luck\n",

It is a little light weight, but after going through carpal tunnel surgery, I don\u0027t think I need one much heavier. Fast shipping and great packaging as well.  Another great find from Amazon\n",

No more nuking junk food, or frying food covered in fat, just steam it.  No more worries about burning things (the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done).  I bought the Oster 5712 last week.  I\u0027ve cooked boiled eggs, frozen chicken breast, Contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far.  It rocks!  Tonight I\u0027m going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and I\u0027m 99.9% sure it will turn out great even though I\u0027ve never tried it before.  This baby makes cooking easy.  Cleaning it is also easy.  No burnt food on it, just hot water.  For cleaning it\u0027s almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater.

    "\nI used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself, so I have tried many cutlery products from many different brands. In 2003, I bought these Calphalon Contemporary shears since I did not own a pair of shears. Before I purchased these, I tried a pair of Henckels Twinshear kitchen shears, and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as I would have liked. I was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in China rather than in Germany or Japan, even though newer brands such as Calphalon and Furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in China. After over a year of using these, I am quite impressed with them. The handles are very comfortable, and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned Henckels shears. Most impressively, the blades show very little wear, despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often. Also, the handles on these are far better compared to those on the Calphalon Traditional and Stainless shears. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top-quality, reasonably priced set of kitchen shears\n",

The first time I used it I fried ham and scrambled eggs in it using less than 2 Tbsp of butter.  Very little stuck to it, and clean up was about as easy as a non-stick pan.  Use a Dobie pad as recommended and you\u0027ll have no problems.  I won\u0027t trade my Calphalon for stainless, but having said that, it looks great, heats evenly, and cooks like a champ.  Well worth the $20.  Give it a try and leave the Wear-Ever non-stick behind\n",
    "\nThe scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the \"Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale\" but it\u0027s a different model. The one I received uses the CR-2430 lithium battery, not four AAs as advertised. Also, the product manual is different. The actual manual\u0027s title is \"67000 - 67007 g/oz,\" not \"8122/8123 g/oz.\" On the bottom of the scale, there is a number similar to Soehnle\u0027s product numbers, 812215. But I could not find such a product anywhere.\n\nFortunately, the maximum weight capacity of this scale is 5000g as advertised. It\u0027s actually about 5280g. The unit of measure is in 1g or 0.05oz increments. Weighing items with this scale is very easy. The LCD screen has large 0.5\" numbers. It has a 2-minute auto shut-off switch, and a supposedly low-battery indication.\n\nOverall, this is a very good scale and I recommend it if you\u0027re willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while\n",

Since they sell a complete set of disks why, oh, why don\u0027t they sell a tower (small footprint) that will hold all of the attachments.  This is short sighted of them.

If you are diminutive female, this knife feels right in the hand since it is a little smaller than a standard chef\u0027s knife.  I love the blade on this knife.

Needless to say, gift buying for them is tricky!  When they got this, their Bodum decanter had just broken, so the timing was perfect...they love this model! Use it daily!  In fact, they\u0027re so impressed, that they now order it from Amazon.com \u0026 give it as a wedding gift to newly married couples in their social circle.  Also note, there is a coordinating sugar \u0026 creamer set available for purchase that matches perfectly, holds adequate volumes of sugar \u0026 cream, \u0026 makes a stunning table display.

    "\nI have four of these mugs.\n\nPros:\n- Keeps coffee hot for a very long time when sealed.\n- Doesn\u0027t leak.\n- Durable.\n- Carabiner makes it easy to clip onto backpack.\n\nCons:\n- A little inconvenient to clean.\n- Nissan unresponsive about replacement parts.\n\nTips:\nMake sure the lid is screwed down snugly, but not too tightly. You want to form a complete seal to prevent leaks and retain heat, but the seal gets tighter as the contents cool and shrink.\n\nDon\u0027t fill past the raised metal fill-line on the inside of the mug. If you overfill the mug, some liquid will be pushed up into the threads when you screw the lid down, and you won\u0027t notice until you tip the mug. (It\u0027s easier to see the line if you fill it beneath an overhead light.) If you think your mug leaks, you\u0027ve probably overfilled it.\n\nIf you fill it just right, you don\u0027t even have to stir your coffee. Just add your sugar, cream, ketchup, or whatever you put in there, seal the lid, and shake the mug to mix it. (I\u0027ve never been able to do this with any other mug).\n\nWhen you wash the mug, remember to remove and wash the silicone rubber o-ring. The lid is hollow and can be pried apart with a spoon for cleaning if some liquid seeps inside.\n\nIf you wash the mug in the dishwasher (Nissan recommends against this), remove the plastic base before (or after) washing to remove the water that collects in there.\n\nIf you lose the gasket (or cut it on a knife in the dishwasher like I did), I\u0027ve found these to be suitable inexpensive replacements after a lot of hunting around: 228 Silicone Rubber O-Ring 70A Durometer, Burnt Orange, 2-1/4\" ID x 2-1/2\" OD x 1/8\" W, by Small Parts Inc\n",

It\u0027s great having the coffee already in the pot.  We get about 4 pots of coffee from what is stored.  The only thing I would have liked better was a 12-cup coffee pot.  I sometimes find after we have our coffee in the morning and with my husband taking a thermos has me sometimes having to make another pot.  It\u0027s no big deal though because it\u0027s so easy.

I use small pellets, not flakes- so that\u0027s all i can rate it for.  It seems to work at the same times every day, and a uniform amount of food appears to drop.  It is not quiet, so if it is used in a bedroom, make sure you adjust your feeding times as not to be disturbed while sleeping.  I acually don\u0027t mind knowing when it\u0027s running, so if i\u0027m around I can check on it\u0027s function. Time will tell if it\u0027s a great product- but so far, so good.\n\nI must change my review- I too had one of the battery contacts break off, and the unit became unreliable. I\u0027d often have to remove and replace the batteries to get it to work again. I\u0027d look elsewhere before buying another\n",

    "\nAs a long time critic of kitchen tools and ALL Miracle Whip applicators, I was skeptical when I was presented with this device. It uses the same \"scraper/spatula\" design that has been prevalent in the United States since the release of the Tupperware model R. At first glance I was not impressed with this tool. It was nothing flashy, although I must admit the red color was quite innovative. But, the real test would have to come when I put it into service. She wasn\u0027t as stiff as some of the hard plastic models I have tested, but not as floppy as most silicone models I have labored through. I would have to say it was a happy medium. So I dug right in and began making some fried wonton stuffed with Miracle Whip, and I must say this spatula sparkled. Pounds of Miracle Whip got stuffed into this little Asian number, and the spatula never failed. I knock off one point for the simple fact, that they don\u0027t offer a Miracle Whip branded version of this spatula. Now that would be really nice. Also, not quite strong enough to be used a tactical weapon, but quite suitable as a disciplinary tool\n",

It does not have to be clamped on the table.  Ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath.  Easy clean up, fast speed, three blades interchangeable for the grinding.  I am totally happy with the product I purchased.  Also, on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing.   The advantage of having a grinder is I can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat\n",

The Boston Cocktail Shaker does not have this problem.  We had no difficulty whatsoever with a tight seal on the first try and have had no leakage problems.  The only drawback (very minor) is that the measurement lines do not go all the way to the bottom of the glass.  So if you\u0027re measuring out small quantities of liquor, you still need to use a jigger.  Other than that, it is very easy to use and clean.  Top rating for this bar helper\n",

At less than 50 is is a great bargain. Another  great use for it is deep frying. It is a tad heavy so do not try to pick it  up and serve because it will very easily slip from your hands.

It always looks beautiful.\n\nThe other thing I like is that the handles and bottom of the pan are stamped Cuisinart so everyone knows this is a quality item. \n\nI\u0027m very happy with my purchase\n",
    "\nI bought 3 of these. They are great. Easy to use, easy to clean and they work. After buying one I ordered 2 more for gifts and both of those people who recieved them also loved them.\n",

    "\nI like these lid covers as they fit very well.  I have always had a hard time with plastic wrap sticking, or aluminum foil tearing.  I would recommend this if you need to store your recipes for a bit before serving them.  I also like the sturdiness of these lids as it does not allow flavors to mix when you put them in the refrigerator\n",
    "\nThere isn\u0027t much you say about a plasic cover, but I\u0027ll try...  These  covers fit securely over the bowl for kepting whatever you\u0027re mixing fresh.   You can also store anything in it like it was a tuperware (spelling?)  item.  I\u0027d recomend having them around, because you\u0027ll use them!  These are  for the 4 1/2 quart bowl and are dishwasher safe\n",
    "\nThis thing is wonderful. I\u0027ve enjoyed one since my first home and it makes a tremendous difference- esp. if you rent and don\u0027t have any control over the kind of tub you have.\n",
    "\nI bought this sheet set almost 5 months ago \u0026 they have actually become my favorite sheets.  I have several sets, and many of them were quite exepensive, but i always seem to reach for these sheets.  The only time we use another set is when we are washing these.  They are very soft \u0026 stretchy (not too stretchy)and wash up so nice(they hold the dryer warmth so well)!  This set has been great during the summer \u0026 i think will also be great during the colder months with a heavier blanket.  You couldn\u0027t get a better set anywhere near this price!\n",
    "\nMy teapot arrived from Amazon very quickly and I was very pleased with my first purchase. It is just the right size for me as I usually make two or three cups. Even though it could hold more, it is not too large for a smaller amount. The tea does not drip when poured . . . thank goodness! The one I had before consistently dripped so my reason for getting a new one. This one also fits well in my hand, and I love the fact that you can microwave it if you need to heat up a bit. Overall, I would say it is quite lovely and and high quality\n",
    "\nItem exactly as promised. Was a gift for Dad\u0027s new wife. She was very happy with it\n",
    "\nEven if entering the kitchen gives you hives, this spoon can make it easier. It\u0027s balanced, easy to use and easy to clean and store.  It goes from the cooktop to serving in a contemporary fashion...WITHOUT spilling, breaking like some of the el-cheapo brands.  If you care for this spoon - it will serve you well for many years.  My first one - I used to death and it died only as a result of an accident with (in?) the blender.  Been searching for one ever since to replace - and at this price I am buying several\n",
    "\nThis is a great product, not only does it boil water fast, it is easy to fill and use, and pours beautifully\n",
    "\nVery nice, beats flimsy plastic. I have broken or otherwise worn out parts of plastic measuring sets. These will probably outlast me\n",
    "\nI bought this for Chinese / Japanese style hotpot.  It turned out to be a fabulous hotpot (fast boiling time) and an excellent grill! Although there are no grill grids, my Korean BBQ and Cajun shrimps turned out wonderful!!!  I have used this pot extensively (once or twice a week) for the past three months and it continues to perform superbly\n",
    "\nI have had these pans for five years now and I use them almost every night.  I have never had any problems with them and they cook the food very evenly.  I would highly recommend them. \n",
    "\nThis thing is a workhorse... I use it every day. Mine\u0027s been going strong for over five years now. I just wish they\u0027d bring back the translucent colors. I love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not. With the current opaque black or white models that\u0027s not possible.\n",
    "\nI have made yogurt with a few tablespoons from the super market or with a previous batch, but sometimes I sweeten the whole batch with honey and forget to reserve some of the good stuff.  I probably use these every other batch or so now.\nWhen I first started making yogurt, using these packets allowed me to vary the time and/or add powdered milk until I found my perfect batch!  I don\u0027t add powdered milk - it makes it thicker but more tart and I prefer it a bit thinner after getting addicted to it in Europe last year.\nThis is the perfect tool for newbies - and a cupboard staple for the more seasoned yogurt-heads\n",
    "\nThe KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they\u0027d exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. \n\nAt this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer\n",
    "\nIt\u0027s common to see these steamers all over the place and from Amazon\u0027s display, this certainly didn\u0027t look any different.  What made me decide to get this was the price and when I opened the box and examined it, I was pleased to find how well-made this item is\n",
    "\nWE HAVE A NEW PUPPY AND I BOUGHT THIS CLEANER.  WHEN I READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS I ALMOST RETURNED IT UNOPENED.  FOR SOME REASON I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I HAD JUST RENTED AN INDUSTRIAL SIZED RUG DOCTOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO TO DO MY CARPETS.  I JUST WANTED TO TRY THIS TO SEE HOW IT WOULD DO.  THE DIRT AND DOG HAIR I GOT OUT WAS AMAZING.  IT WAS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND TO USE.  I RECENTLY HAD SHOULDER SURGERY AND THIS WAS VERY EASY TO OPERATE WITH ONE ARM!  THANK YOU SO MUCH\n",
    "\nI love to spend my time in the kitchen, but what I don\u0027t like to spend is obscene amounts of money. If I\u0027m going to buy something I\u0027d like to buy high quality so that I don\u0027t have to go buy it in a year or two.\n\nI kind of balked at the price - I found plenty of measuring spoon sets for a third of the cost of this stainless steel set. But after receiving it and using it, I don\u0027t regret the extra money at ALL. \n\nThis set has been more than faithful to me in the time I\u0027ve had it - it\u0027s dependable, I can toss it into the dishwasher with no fears and the labels won\u0027t rub off. I\u0027m not afraid of abusing this set; it\u0027s stood up to my frantic mad dashes around the kitchen from the cookie dough to the spaghetti sauce. If your old set has worn down to nothing and you\u0027re looking for something that will stay in your kitchen longer and more faithfully than you will -- this is the set for you.\n",
    "\nAfter years of trying to make smoothies in a regular blender, and having to stop and stir, and stop and stir, and worry about burning out the motor, we now don\u0027t have to worry any more. Even when ALL of the fruit we add is frozen, this machine grinds, chops, and smooths with impressive power. It\u0027s fairly easy to clean, provided you don\u0027t wait for days, and has a handy pouring valve thing. A few recipes are included\n",
    "\nI am so pleased with these sheets.  Prior to this purchase, the most thread count I had in my sheets was 600.  These 1000-thread-count sheets are much more luxurious.  \n\nIn addition to the thread-count quality, these sheets fit my bed better, are wider and deeper than my other sheets.  They cover my thick mattress with sheet to spare\n",
    "\nThis is my second DLC-10.  The only reason for replacement is because the bowl cracked and it became cost effective to just make a machine rerplacement.  I have all the disks and such and like the machine very much as I have had it for 20 years\n",
    "\nThe processor works terrific! It saves us much time everyday.\nOne minor problem is some foods get stuck between the cover and the blade and can not be processed\n",
    "\nAfter reading some of the reviews, I was somewhat reluctant to buy this product, but it went on sale at $3.99, and I decided to risk it.\n\nIt measures up the the quality and function of most Oxo products.  The measurements on the side and inside are completely accurate, which is different from what some have described.\n\nI like the cup better than my pyrex ones for dry and cold liquid products, but being plastic, it cannot be used for hot products that contain grease or oil.  The handle is ergonomically designed and is easy to scoop flour, sugar, beans, or other bulk products.\n\nThe only negative is that you have to have another measuring cup for hot, greasy products\n",
    "\nIt\u0027s sort of cheap, but it works quite well.  The water comes out clean, with no odd taste (which some filter systems can do)\n",
    "\nThis is the best French Oven I have ever used. It cooks evenly and cleans easily. While it is very heavy, that must add to the excellence of its cooking and that\u0027s what I wanted. No complaints. 5 Stars\n",
    "\nI am buying a replacement that I had for 15 years. It still works but the light went off.  I never thought they were still making it. I tried recently 2 other brands that did not make it 1 month paid around $25. I gave up, I was still using my old Westclck  until today when I found this one on Amazon.\n",
    "\nWe have a large family and we use our electric skillet a lot.  In the past we have purchased the cheaper versions from Wal-mart.  They don\u0027t heat evenly, and we were constantly replacing them because the cheap plastic legs or handles would break.  The Cuisinart CSK-150 1500-Watt Nonstick Oval Electric Skillet is AWESOME!!  The cooking area is huge (we can cook 6 pancakes at a time easily) and the cooking surface heats up evenly.  It is very heavy, so it doesn\u0027t scoot around on the counter.  Nice metal handles an base.  Glass lid is also very sturdy with a steam vent.  It is very beautiful and functional. Because of the quality of the construction, I believe it will last our family for many years. I have not previously recommended any item online before, but I highly recommend this item\n",
    "\nI have owned this can opener now for several months and it is BY FAR the BEST can opener I have ever owned.  I have had probably 10 electric openers in my lifetime, but this is just wonderful.  It is smooth, super easy to attach the can, quiet, and does NOT splatter the contents of the can all over the opener when it\u0027s done cutting like all the other did!!!  The detachable parts make it sanitary too, you can put it in the dishwasher! I can\u0027t say enough about this opener....you will NOT be disappointed!!\n\n",
    "\nHey, not to be too redundant but this really is a good Can Opener. I have NO problems with it, my wife, who always has problems with can openers has \"some\" problems \"sometimes\" using it but as she NEVER could get any of the others to ever work this is a big improvement. The knife sharpener is an okay touch, however, if you have good knives I wouldn\u0027t use it. I sharpen by hand with an \"Edge Pro\" but hey, it\u0027s a CAN OPENER. It will sharpen a knife I just wouldn\u0027t put my $100 Schaaf \"Golden Hamster\" through, maybe my Chicago for a quick fix\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve never had a \"nice\" set of knives before. These are great! They have a nice feel in my hands. The only reason I didn\u0027t give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart. The scissors I bought at Smart \u0026 Final come apart for easy washing and drying\n",
    "\nA dutch oven is one of the most versatile items you can find. Many people I know are intimidated by cooking with dutch ovens, but when you take a few minutes to learn how, you can use it to cook anything! It can be used with variety of foods: stews, cakes, cobblers, breads, poultry, vegetables (basically anything you make in a conventional oven). If you happen to forget to pack your skillet when you go camping, turn over the lid and put it back on the dutch oven. Voila! Instant skillet-type cooking surface!   Additionally, this smaller dutch oven stacks well with the 12-inch version, so you can cook more than one course at a time!\n\nHaving used a variety of dutch ovens in my life, I can tell you for sure, Lodge dutch ovens are the best. They are durable and well-crafted. If you have ever had the experience of cooking with a dutch oven that was not a Lodge, you will know what I mean. \n\nYou should look for a dutch oven that has a lip on the lid for keeping coals on, and sturdy legs, to keep from crushing the coals. Lodge dutch ovens have these features, and are made of quality cast iron. Lodge also has many accessories for cooking, such as lid lifters and lid rests, inserts for muffins, etc. \n\nDutch ovens make a great gift for the camper in your life. Highly reccommended\n",
    "\nThe other review is so obviously someone from SENTRY that I thought I\u0027d add my two cents. My house hasn\u0027t burned down so I don\u0027t know if this works, but I\u0027ve read other articles that say it does. It is heavy (since the foam contains water to evaporate and dissipate heat in a fire), and there is no rubber grips on the bottom, so it can slide around a lot. It\u0027s a lot cheaper and more convient than renting a safety deposit box.\n",
    "\nSentry Insulated Chest\n\nEvery household should have some method of protecting things like birth certificates, deeds, wills, stocks, bonds, and other valuables.\n\nPros:\n\n  - Inexpensive box helps keeps your valuables \"safe\" from fire, kids, and nosey adults.\n  - Attractive; has nice handle; no sharp edges.\n  - Excellent value for the money.\n\nCons:\n\n  - Flat key model (SEN1100) has a rather cheap-looking lock mechanism.\n  - It weighs nearly 20 pounds, but that\u0027s because the walls are 1\" thick and fire-resistant material isn\u0027t light.\n\nGo to sentrysafe dot com to view all the Sentry offerings.  \n\nMy advice is to buy the Sentry model 2100 rather than this model (SEN1100).  The 2100 has a better (tubular key) lock, but only costs a few dollars more.  (Staples dot com sells the 2100.)  Sentry rates these boxes as follows:\n\n1100 - UL classified - 30 minute fire protection\n2100 - ETL verified for 30 minute fire protection of CDs and DVDs up to 1550 degrees F\n\nNo small fire-box is particularly theft resistant.  Even if bolted down, a lid could be forced opened with tools.  In addition, although the 2100\u0027s fire rating is higher than the 1100, many non-portable safes offer better fire ratings.  They are also larger and far more expensive.  For better protection, you\u0027d need to spend more money, but a Sentry chest is much better than doing nothing.\n\nI use mine to store DVD backups of computer files.  The Sentry chest is kept inside a large, fire-resistant safe.  Hopefully, this double protection will do the job if there is ever a fire.  DVD and other computer media will be destroyed at much lower temperatures than paper.\n\n\nI\u0027m a retired Federal employee and have no connection whatever to any manufacturer of any product\n",

    "\nI know these got poor reviews, as ice cube trays.  But I used them to freeze my baby\u0027s homemade fruits and veggies and they worked great.  The lids were a little tricky at first, but as long as you don\u0027t overfill them, you\u0027ll have no problems removing the lids.  A couple twists of the tray, and the food cubes slid right out!  They were much cheaper than trays marketed specifically for freezing baby food\n",

    "\nThese Bodum glasses are simply amazing.  There\u0027s no other way to describe a glass out of which I can have my coffee in the morning and ice cold liquids at night.\n\nThe added bonus is that liquid of any kind becomes a work of art in these glasses.  The liquid is suspended in space, and to top off the experience, the glasses never sweat and they never feel hot or cold to the touch.\n\nTotally awesome...worthy of more than 5 stars\n",
    "\nNo picture can really do these glasses justice.  They have nothing aesthetic in common with any other double-walled cup I\u0027ve ever seen--elegant, minimalist, super clear and light as a feather.  They really keep stuff cold (or hot, as the case may be).  They\u0027re even dishwasher safe.  However, they are remarkably fragile.  I accidentally rapped a spoon on the lip of one and within half an hour, the little crack had spread and the glass was in fragments.  But if you\u0027re careful with them and keep them away from kids, animals, and, apparently, me, they will serve you well\n",
    "\nI ordered these towels in two colors mainly because the price was right.  But when they arrived I was so pleased.  They\u0027re larger than I expected and very plush.  I\u0027ve washed them several times and they look as good as when I first opened them.  It\u0027s really nice to finally have towels that actually dry you off\n",
    "\nThese towels are great! I was surprised how large they are, but it\u0027s been a while since I bought towels, maybe all new towels are really big.  These towels are so absorbent, it\u0027s hard to tell when they\u0027ve been used because the water just seems to disappear.  And soft, soft, soft...brand new out of the box they feel great.  Again, they\u0027re big, so a litle heavy, but they are wonderful.  These are an amazing bargain and feel very luxurious.  I don\u0027t know what towels those other reviewers said resulted in fuzzies, they must have been referring to another product, these towels are awesome, no fuzzies, they are very well made\n",
    "\nI have used every major brand of cutlery and I can tell you there is no better value than analon knives. I have been cooking and managing restuarants for over 30 years and I have found that the $100 knives are no better than thr $25 ones. The analon product looks and feels just as nice as the most expnesive brands out there and is one third the price. Try them you will love them. I might add that all knives have to be reground from time to time as the edge will become blunt and no sharpener will restore it. When this happens find a local grinding service and have them restored. A good knife can last you a lifetime if you take care of it happy chopping Mik\n",
    "\nIf you like knives that hold their edge, have good balance, and feel more expensive than they really are, this knife\u0027s a smart purchase.  We bought ours with the intent to get Henckels. My husband loves to cook and I have demanding standards for tools in my kitchen, especially knives.  Anolon were half the price and every bit as good.  \nAs their reputation spreads, the prices seem to be going consistently up. \n",

It even holds my knife sharpener\n",
    "\nEnough said.\n\nDON\u0027T PUT A FROZEN JAR ON THE BASE AND YOU WON\u0027T HAVE TO REPLACE THE BLADE ASSEMBLY.  I am sure the owners manual says that someplace.\n\nMy Kitchen Aid became unusable because replacement blades were not available 16 months after I purchased it.  Aren\u0027t you glad you could purchase the replacement part?\n\nMy story:  My son put his leftover smoothie into the freezer, jar and all.  The next day when he took the jar out of the freezer and put it on the Kitchen Aid blender, the motor broke the blade assembly.  The motor base was still good and I liked the blender.  Kitchen Aid changed their model and didn\u0027t make replacement parts.  I think it is unreasonable for a manufacturer to not have replacement parts available after just 16 months.  (...)!\n\nI can\u0027t say enough good things about the quality and ease of use of my Cuisinart blender.  The jar\u0027s shape helps the food move and mix better than a round jar.  The jar\u0027s size is larger than any I have found.  I pour from the corner of the jar if the mix is too thick to pour from the spout (which I concede is a little wide).  The weight keeps the blender in place.  The shipping weight is around 15 LBS is that too heavy?  Maybe you should skip the smoothies and switch to a muscle building drink.  Most every quality blender has weight to it.  The plastic units are light and considered disposable.  Keep buying those $30 disposable blenders if you want, however I\u0027ll keep my Cuisinart!\n\nThe three year warranty and Cuisinart\u0027s backing keep us, the consumer, in parts when we do something stupid (like putting the frozen smoothie mix on the blender and breaking the blade assembly).  (...) replacement blade assembly is cheaper than being FORCED to purchase a new blender (Kitchen Aid).\n\nBuy the Cuisinart a great value for a quality product.\n",

The bottom isn\u0027t completely solid, but has space for a small pocket of air when it\u0027s sitting on the counter. It\u0027s inconsequential though, because the glass in these mugs is as thick as you would want any of your thick glass beer mugs. When I saw how nice they were, I actually went back online and bought 2 more and their margarita set which was also rediculously cheap ($15 for 6 glasses and a picher).

Do yourself a favor: stop bending your soup spoons and get a Zyliss Ice Cream Scoop.\n",
    "\nIt works great, and it\u0027s small (6\" high, 5\" diameter) and easy to use. May require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave. For me: 7 minutes for soft, 8 min for medium, and 9-10 min for hard eggs on high power (700W microwave).\n\nIt does get very hot, so you need to remove it from the microwave with a potholder or towel.

In the heat of the last month, it\u0027s been going almost 24 hours a day, and it\u0027s not slowed down or stopped yet. \n\nIt\u0027s a bit noisier than the Vornado I have in the bedroom, but on the other hand, it\u0027s a stronger fan.  I watch television in the same room, and don\u0027t have any problem, so unless you\u0027re extremely sensitive to sound, it\u0027s fine.\n\nBe careful moving it around;  The \"head\" of the fan tends to come off the base if you aren\u0027t paying attention.  It locks in place when you put it down, but moving it seems to make it \"unlock.\"\n\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no-name cast iron pan that I bought in Solvang ten years ago.  It is very well broken in with a smooth non-stick patina in all seven indents.  I want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon, and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies!  \n\nTherefore, I have been looking to buy some additional aebleskiver pans and I was excited to see this new pan from Lodge, so I ordered one to give it a try.  I like the design a lot and am impressed with how it heats up quickly and holds it\u0027s temperature nicely.  The first batch of aebleskivers had some sticking, but I expected that.  I will need to use it a lot more before it has the same non-stick surfaces as my old pan (no, it\u0027s not for sale!), but I can tell that this pan will get there with use.\n\nBy the way, I\u0027ve found that there are many recipes for aebleskivers and several different techniques for cooking them.  I\u0027m sure that they all will work well with some practice, but I\u0027ll describe the one that I\u0027ve settled on, because it is so easy:\n\nHeat the pan at a medium-low setting.  Take about two cups of prepared pancake mix (I use Krusteaz Buttermilk) and add a couple of teaspoons of sugar.  Mix it in and stir in enough cold water to make the consistency about the same as you would for drop bisquits.  Don\u0027t overmix it and let it sit for awhile to rise a bit before you cook it.  Put a little butter or margerine in each indent and add about a teaspoonful of batter to each indent (If you\u0027re new to aebleskivers, I recommend trying only three at once.)  I then drizzle a little butter on the edges of each indent.  After about a minute, I use a knitting needle (or chopstick) to turn each aebleskiver one quarter turn.  I add a little more butter and then turn them so the round side is up.  I keep turning them with a spoon until they\u0027re done.  (You\u0027ll just have to break one of them open to check, because it\u0027s dependent on your batter and temperature.)\n\nOnce you get it down (usually after a few rejects), serve them in threes on a small plate with thinned out raspberry jam and powdered sugar.  Once you eat them, you\u0027ll understand why people go through all this just to make a pancake that looks like a racquetball! \n",
    "\ni\u0027ve had this can opener 4 more than 5 years \u0026 have never had a problem!!!  i even let my 4-year old niece use it when she stays with me \u0026 helps me cook.  never have 2 worry about anything with this one\n",
    "\nThis is a wonderful can opener!!! I wouldn\u0027t have any other. The trick to having perfectly cut edges is to let the can spin around twice. I hold onto the can so that when it starts making its second round, I tighten my grip a little and the moment the lid comes lose it starts spinning. I have noticed that if I buy the dirt cheap, no name vegetables at the dollar store, the opener has difficulty. I guess one should blame the can and not the opener. It is a small price to pay for having such a safe appliance around. But then my opener is a couple years old so maybe my blade is just wearing out... If there is no replacement blade, you can bet I will buy another can opener just like this, and if I have to, on Ebay! \nI am sure this new technology has saved more than one lost or stray animal digging at the landfill or in the alley for a morsel of food. I just couldn\u0027t bear the thought of someone\u0027s lost puppy or an abandoned cat getting his tongue cut. Those old can openers are just plain dangerous. Call me a bleeding heart but it matters. It\u0027s not like my own pet couldn\u0027t knock the trash over when I\u0027m gone and end up cutting themselves on one of those old fashioned, razor sharp lids. There are both elderly and child relatives in my house all the time and I just don\u0027t feel safe with those old tin cutters around. \nAll it takes is a little patience with new technology and using this can opener on more than just a couple cans to get the hang of it. There is no need to slam this appliance on the counter or floor. That\u0027s rediculous. As far as oversized cans, that\u0027s not what this was made for.  \n",
    "\nI have to admit that I was surprised when the rolling pin arrived. I\u0027m used to OXO quality, but this is over the top. It is a big rolling pin, with an ideal diameter. It is also heavy. It\u0027s heft helps keep it where it belongs, instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder. It has a strong axle, which glides remarkably smoothly, even when the pressure is on. The hard non stick surface works very well, and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings. The handles are simply the best I have have encountered. This is a very well designed kitchen tool that fully lives up to the \u0026quot;Good Grips\u0026quot; promise of quality\n",
    "\nI had seen my Japanese coworkers carry this thing to work.  It\u0027s a great lunch bag! Beats brown bagging, because hot foods stay hot, and cold foods stay cold.  I finally bought one because of the ease of use, didn\u0027t want to keep paying $$$ for hot lunches, and I can always bring my favorite foods.  The bottom container is the only leakproof container. (That is my only gripe.) I usually put soup in here.  The other containers will hold things without sauces very well.  It\u0027s great because it allows for a large variety of foods (better nutrition).  I have used bento lunch boxes since I was kid, and this is the best for adults. I like asian food, and this type of lunch box accomodates the best. \n\nIf you want to fill hot food, then pour in hot water in the containers for 10 minutes, let it get warm.  Pour out the water, dry.  Then fill.  If you want ice cold food, put in freezer for 10 minutes, then put food in.   \n\nThey also make bigger versions for larger appetites and another smaller one for small appetites.  They really do stay hot. Once I had to take a very late lunch, I packed it at 7am, and at 2:30pm the food was still hot. No more waiting in line to microwave your lunch !!!\n",
    "\nThey are working well so far. They stain a little when grease gets on them\n",
    "\nThis makes baking so much easier, things just pop right out.  The light weight and noiselessness of the product make this a real winner.  Baking just keeps getting easier and easier.  I have replaced all my bakeware possible with these silicone bakeware items.  I love them\n",
    "\nWhen I decided to buy this oven, I was not even looking to buy a convection toaster oven.  I stumbled across this item looking for cookware.  I read all the reviews, thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it.  Boy, am I glad that I did!!!  And so is my family.  The day we received it, I cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack.  Extremely easy.  All I needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me.  Since then, we have cooked more muffins, a meatloaf, bacon, toast, english muffins, chicken strips, waffles and bratwurst.  My kitchen doesn\u0027t heat up like when I use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven.  It was so easy for my husband to use this also while I was shopping and I just gave him a 15 second class before I left.  I didn\u0027t notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods.  This is my first Convection Toaster oven, which has replaced the microwave and toaster, and I can assure you we expect to use this oven alot.  I love the design, the warming tray does just that, even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm.  It\u0027s great! The oven is big enough to cook meatloaf or chicken breasts and yet is not so monstrous that you lose your entire counter for one appliance.  I would recommend this to anyone.  What a great idea for the kitchen\n",
    "\nVery good buy for $85 +free ship. Bought this one to replace a smaller Black \u0026 Decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5-6 years until controls gave out (the B\u0026D still works, just have to keep the button pressed in).  \n\nI looked at reviews of several toaster ovens before purchasing the T-Fal.  The less expensive ones ($25-$40) were getting dinged because of occasional mentions of overheating or fire risk.  Not worth the chance.  I also wanted something as small as possible because we have little counter space in our 10\u0027 x 10\u0027 kitchen, so a more expensive one was not an option.  \n\nThe T-fal gave dimensions on Amazon \u0026 it was 3 inch wider, deeper, taller than our B\u0026D.  No big deal - wrong.  It was bigger than I thought when I put it on the counter, looked like a monster compared to the B\u0026D.  Also, I could not open the top warmer lid to the point it stays open.  This because of height restrictions -- bottom of my kitchen cabinet is at about 54 - 60 inches.  I can open the top, but I need to hold it open.  My fault, not the product or mfr.  But be aware that size matters in a small kitchen.\n\nThe function buttons are very simple, nothing complicated - one button for toast, one for bake, another for broil.  You can set how long it stays on, and it beeps (electronically) three times when it shuts off.  There is a clock, but it could be easier to set.  \n\nI mainly use it to toast bread, bagels, sandwiches and to bake small pizzas (sauce with cheese on a pita - easy).  The toast function takes longer than the old B\u0026D (about 4.5 vs 2 minutes), but thats OK by me.  The bake function works very well, I prefer it muchly over starting the oven to bake something small.\n\nClean-up is a snap with a removeable crumb tray, glass doors and non-stick surfaces.\n\nNegatives: you can pull the rack out about 30-40 percent before it tips forward and burns you.  It\u0027s controllable, not a big deal, unless you don\u0027t know about it.  I did know thanks to previous reviews and I was prepared for it.  \nThe fan was louder than I expected (I expected no noise since the B\u0026D has no fan).  But it is a soft sound, lower than my computer fan and only on during cooking.\n\nOverall, it\u0027s a well built, well-designed machine. \n",
    "\nOverall this is a fine scale.  One \"convenient\" feature is an auto zero function.  If the scale has been tared and the tare weight removed, rather than displaying a negative weight, the scale automatically re-zeros.  This may be handy most of the time, but sometimes it\u0027s a pain.  With my old scale, I could tare a partially filled bowl, remove the bowl from the scale, add more goodies, and place it back on the scale to determine the weight of the additional material.  That doesn\u0027t work with this scale--it rezeros when a tared weight is removed\n",
    "\nI hope these things are airtight because I just bought my fourth set.  I don\u0027t buy the freezer storage containers because I own these.  They can be used in cooking and freezing so I save on pricey disposable freezer bags. The little ones I use to store one package each of corn starch, yeast, baking powder, baking soda, three hamburger patties and to prepare, freeze and bake individual sized servings of salmon fillets.\n\nThe medium ones and the large ones are for leftovers, soup fixings, freezer meals, steaming chicken, fruit salad et al. \n\nI\u0027m ten percent tempted to try out the rectangular ones because some foods I don\u0027t want to freeze in a stack but I don\u0027t think I would get as much use out of them as I do these round ones.  I really would like to buy a fifth set but I won\u0027t. I rarely have more than one or two empty ones to spare. These get used all the time. I really didn\u0027t like using plastic wrap or aluminum foil to refrigerate food.  These lids are more secure and therefore I am less stressed\n",

    "\nThe AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed is a Godsend.  Due to a disability, I needed a raised bed that would allow me the convenience of a somewhat normal height bed, so my husband \u0026 I could camp with other family members at a recent family reunion.  The AeroBed Premier Raised not only afforded me that ability, but also provided a surprisingly comfortable night\u0027s sleep as well.  The bed is made of the highest quality material, and did not lose any air.\n\n\nI needed a dependable product, as I would not have tried this with a cheap airbed.  I got all that I wanted in purchasing the AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed, plus I now have a comfortable extra bed for overnight guests.\n",
    "\nAlthough it\u0027s a \u0027chicken fryer\u0027, I use it to pan-fry everything, and it works amazing! The depth of the pan allows larger amount of food inside, being stirred without spilling out. And the smaller diameter helps to concentrate heat in the pan. The nonstick feature truly works, nothing sticks to the pan, even the thick starch\n",

However, I can tell you that this is a durable mattress pad.  It went camping with us without a problem.  And it washes easily.  those are important factors to consider\n",
    "\nLove the pan, the center is so cool, because you can tell when the product is pre-heated.....the center changes and it is so great.  The pan is almost too big, but it is perfect for everything I can possibly cook in it\n",

    "\nI recently broke two of my favorite pieces of Corelle Baking and Serving Dishes. I looked on several sites and it seemed all I could find was the handleless French Style Corningware, which I have and find hard to use due to being without handles. This Bakeware has great handles and I love it. I love the Chutney on the side, I compared this price with ordering just two piece of the same thing in Abundance Design and the oblong baking dish separate and it was $10.00 more without the ramkins. This was a better value\n",

    "\nI am an avid baker. Sometimes you need to whip up your egg whites to fold in later. Having an extra bowl makes this so much easier than transferring to a different type bowl. Or maybe you are making Christmas cookies - you can have one batter chilling in the fridge while you are mixing another one. It\u0027s well worth the money\n",
    "\nI bought this scale back in Jan or Feb. I needed one and after looking around for a while found that I liked this one the best because of its easy to read decimile display- pounds on one side, ounces (down to the tenth) on the other side. The lb/k switch is located on the bottom side of the unit and I don\u0027t find it inconvient down there. This scale also has a auto shutoff feature that helps save your batteries but has never shut off while I\u0027m in the middle of measuring. Because of previous complaints to that effect when I first got mine I timed how long it would stay on ending up with close to 2.5 min before it did. I also love the look of the scale it is sleek and stylish, very clean lines and is easy to clean too, just a quick wipe down and I\u0027m done. As a note to Alton Brown fans this is his scale of choice on Good Eats. The price tag may have you shying away but I assure you that its worth every penny. I would not trade mine for anything!\n",
    "\nI do a lot of stir frying, using one pan to do many dishes.  As a result I needed a pan that had non-stick quality for quick and easy cleaning and one that could take high heat from my professional stovetop.  When pan and oil are heated to the right temperature the interior 18/10 stainless steel surface behaved as if it were nonstick.  The heat was evenly conducted bottom through the sides, this due to the aluminium core sandwich being continuous from the bottom up the sides.  The sides are high enough to not have food spill out in the process of vigourous stir frying. The height is also good for small item deep frying.  The steep sloping of the sides enabled food to rotate well, falling back easily into the pan.  Quality pans tend to be heavy,  All Clad without exception but this size is perfectly manageable for tossing ingredients if need to.  It also cooks a generous portion for one to two persons.  All types(including metal) of utensils can be used with it.  This is a solid, handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and use.  It is a total joy to cook with and one that gives you confidence that it will last a long, long time\n",
    "\nI first would like to say that if you are the occasional esspresso drinker, then this machine is to costly to use every once in a while go with a cheaper brand.  Now for the rest of you that are die hard esspresso drinkers this is the machine for you.\n\nI moved from AK to NY a few months ago, while I lived in AK (ALASKA) there were coffe shops on every corner, to say the least I was addicted to mochas, and moving to NY they are few and far between.  I was going into withdrawl.  After doing some research I found this great machine.  I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review about it.  I love this machine.  This machine is fast and the esspresso is great.  I am a fan of regular esspresso as well and it comes out at a consistanly high quality,  the Crema is perfect, however I found if you are using the single shot it doesn\u0027t come out that great so always use the double shot.  The machine heats up quickly and everything is provided for you, two cups, two saucers, a pitcher and a frothing attachment.  I can see that this machine will pay for itself withing no time.  I have owned cheaper models in the past and you can really tell the difference in the quality of the esspresso.  I have not used the pod attachment so I can\u0027t comment on that.  If you buy the machine in my opinion you wont be disappointed\n",

Evenly cooked, no sticking, no burning.  For special occasion pies it is a huge asset.  Bringing a homemade apple pie to the table in a classic dish definitely ups the WOW factor.  In addition to the presentation value it bakes like a dream.  Crisp, even, golden crusts and bubbly filling.  Its also great with egg dishes like quiche that require very even heating for best results.  \n\nEven if you are only the occasional baker you won\u0027t result splurging on an heirloom pie dish. \n",

I think the high power motor coupled with the narrow strip equates to superior suction but a little more time in use.\n This vacuum is totally worth the $60\n",

This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it.\n\n  I have never used this item to store anything else other than water; but in theory, you should be able to make tea or coffe the night before and still have it hot in the morning 6 to 8 hours later, assuming the liquid is boiling when you pour it in.\n\n  Some of the heat from the water is lost from the initial contact with the carafe, so the liquid you store will always be a little cooler than its intial temperature.\n\n",

    "\nFor years we have used the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea makers and have purchased two of them.  This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker.  Even though I/we haven\u0027t used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee.  First of all the taste (using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers.   Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher.  Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker.  Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it\u0027s usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it.  This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought, before my purchase, that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better.  On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket (mild, medium, strong), we usually use Medium.  \n\nWe enjoy \"Sweet-Tea\" being from the South and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it\u0027s hot at the time of brewing.  Our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed.  Once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea every-time.  If you enjoy tea, even if you never considered an electric tea maker, the Hamilton Beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret.  Having two Mr. Coffee makers before this Hamilton Beach I don\u0027t see myself ever purchasing another Mr. Coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker.  I HIGHLY recommend the Hamilton Beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the Mr. Coffee, it\u0027s totally worth it\n",
    "\nI am very impressed with this set. The pans are of heavy guage steel and have rolled edges.  I had 3 pounds of chicken on the cookie sheet and with a one handed lift the pan did not flex as my other pans did, again heavy guage steel.  The handles and the nonstick surface have had no problems at 450 degrees. Other brands that I have used deteriorate rapidly at 400 degrees or above. Keep in mind I am not a cook and by my very method of cooking (set oven to high and wait til you smell something burning) I am very hard on pans of any kind. A very high quality product that I would have gladly paid 50 bucks for. By the way, the cooling rack is nonstick as well.\n",

    "\nWith the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us.  We like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee.  Most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing.    But you must use their carafe.  With this maker you can use your own mug.  And if the carafe breaks (and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes) you can still use the maker with the mug or other container.  I sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher.  Sure this maker isn\u0027t fancy, but I just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that doesn\u0027t take up lots of counter space.  I haven\u0027t had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve had lots of coffemakers over the years, and always had a problem pouring the coffee into a cup. It ran over the side and made a mess, unless you poured it very slowly. I saw this model a few years ago and decided to try it. It is great. I will never own anything else. I have been looking for one to replace my old one, only because the heating element is dirty/rusty looking (my wife doesn\u0027t like it). In fact I\u0027m going to buy one right now on Amazon, as I\u0027ve looked at a few stores and the new Black and Decker models I have seen,don\u0027t have the dripless pouring spout\n",

    "\nThese oval dishes are just the right size for sides, and they stay warm a very long time besides looking great.

    "\nThis is a fantastic idea for teaballs. Sleek and stylish, this set is also practical.\n\nThe two teaballs are spring-loaded, and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea. Simply press the plunger, then stir the ball around in your loose tea container. Lift it out of the tea and shake the excess out to level the tea. Let go of the plunger, and the teaball closes securely. The long stem on the balls allow you to take the ball out of your cup (or stir the tea as it\u0027s brewing, if that\u0027s your preference) without having to lift a hot chain off of the side of your cup of hot water.\n\nPrior to this purchase, we used a tea \u0027spoon\u0027, which also spring-loaded shut. The problem with the spoon is that to fill it with tea, you have to hold it vertically in the container, which means you have few options - either close the spoon while the tea is still sticking out the sides, and fill your cup with loose tea, or try to shake the extra tea out after you pull the spoon of the container, and get tea all over your counter. Because of these teaballs\u0027 design, they don\u0027t share that problem.\n\nThe tower has one interesting feature, but some shortcomings. The good design is that below where each teaball hangs, there is a significant \u0027bowl\u0027 to catch any tea that might still be dripping. This has proven to be a very handy feature. The tower itself isn\u0027t very mobile, however. Due to how the hooks hold the teaball stems, it is seemingly impossible to move without one of the balls falling out. Also, when I got mine, the tower was visibly crooked, and I had to bend it back straight. That worked for me, but was quite hard, and I was worried I\u0027d break it.\n\nOh, cleanup - cleanup is much easier than with the aforementioned spoon. The spoon hinges so that there is little clearance at the back of the utensil for washing out. These balls don\u0027t share that problem at all. The plunger gives more than adequate clearance to simply turn the ball sideways and wash it out in the sink (just make sure your sink\u0027s filter is in!)\n\nAll in all, I\u0027m pleased with the purchase. It\u0027s such a fantastic idea that a few shortcomings don\u0027t significantly mar how well the product works\n",
    "\nI love these oven mitts.  They have a magnet in them so you can stack them one on top of the other and stick them to your oven or refrigerator, or other metal surface.  They are not as cumbersome as the really long, heavily molded ones.  I bought them for all of my grown children and they all love them too. \n",

    "\nIn my opinion:\n\nWell, I ordered two of these, one for my Daughter. Since I had two, guess what I did? You\u0027re right - I tested both on the same hot and cold materials to see how close they read. Well, they were within 1/2 degree F. of each other, which in a laboratory is sloppy, but for cooking food, it\u0027s darn accurate. \n\nI have several oven thermometers, you know, the mechanical ones, and I use this unit to see how accurate they are. \nAlso, I wanted a thermometer to be able to check the temperature of thinner foods, such as a hamburger, chicken patty, chicken breasts. Now, as you know, when you check the temperature of these items, you want a really quick reading, because your hand is close to the heat. Well, it\u0027s not as quick as advertised. It will take about 8 to 10 seconds to get a good reading, but that\u0027s not terribly long. Make sure you slide the temp probe through the handle so that your hand can be even further away from the fire.\n\nNext, it can be calibrated, so I put it up against a $400 Fluke meter, and it came within .8 degrees F, so I would consider it within specs. For food preparation, the difference would have no meaning. \n\nFinally, it seems to be holding up well against accidental drops and getting slightly wet. I\u0027ve bought others, including those ridiculous forks with the built-in thermometers, but this unit is the best\n",
    "\nWhen I ordered this saucepan, I didn\u0027t realize how high the quality would be.  When I opened the box and first lifted the saucepan, I was immediately impressed with the weight and quality.  Each time that I use this pan to heat up foods, I am constantly surprised at how much less time it takes for those foods to cook.  Water boils very quickly.  Lastly, the engraved measuring lines for liquids are  extremely helpful.  All in all, the best saucepan that I\u0027ve owned\n",
    "\nI really like the hampers.  They don\u0027t take up a lot of floor space and with three, I can separate the laundry.  The handles make it easy to move them.

    "\nMy boyfriend and I live in a two room apartment. There is not a lot of storage space. I ordered two of these hampers and the first one just came. I put his clothes in and he still has half of the hamper left. I am so glad to get something that is sturdy and large now we will have a place to put our clothes. \n",

    "\nThis cake form is phenominal!  After spaying it with the flour/butter Pam, my cakes are flawless.  I have never been disappointed with how my cakes have turned out with this pan.  Not one corner of the pattern was soft.  Every detail comes out crisp and so very clean.  I have bought other pans from this maker and only have good things to say about them\n",
    "\nI love this pan. It\u0027s a 10 + in my eyes.  When it arrived I washed it with mild soap and water.  Dried it, sprayed cooking spray and filled it with my cake batter and popped it in the preheated oven.  37 minutes later a gorgeous cake was baked.  I turned the pan over on a wire rack and my cake fell right out without one crumb stuck in the pan.  I\u0027m going to give this pan as gifts in the future.  \nThis cake design is especially lovely when you dust the cake with powdered sugar and cinnamon..............\n",
    "\nI used La Cloche to make bread with, specifically San Francisco Sourdough, with SPECTACULAR results. The crust was crisp but chewey, and I could not imagine baking another loaf without it. But after I used it the first time, the bottom developed a crack. After a second use, the crack became so large that I will not use it again for fear it will break during cooking.\n\nI called Sassafras Enterprises (800.537.4941), and for $8.00 to cover shipping/handling they are sending out a replacement bottom. Their customer service was outstanding, and I feel they build a quality product. I also purchased the rectangular version of La Cloche, and I have not had an issue. Perhaps our La Cloche was damaged during shipping. I would have rated it 5 stars otherwise\n",
    "\nI love to bake.  I really love to bake bread.  My specialty is sourdough.  So now I have 3 strikes against me, that is, until I found La Cloche.  \n\nAlthough it can be used to cook meats, I personally only use it for bread.  La Cloche turns your regular oven into a brick oven, and the quality of your bread will amaze you.  It browns beautifully, has a crispy, chewy crust that seems to carmelize the sugars in the crust differently.  There is no need to spray water or create steam in the oven, because the steam is created inside La Cloche by the bread itself.  So actually bread making is more simple and safe because you are not spraying water into a 500 degree oven. \n\nThere are 2 shapes, a french bread style and round oven hearth style.  I have both and pop them into the oven at the same time, so I am baking 2 loaves of bread at once, which is a little more economical.   \n\nTruly, I wish I had this from the beginning of my baking attempts.  If you are a baker or love one, go ahead and spring for it.  You will never regret this kitchen tool.   All my other bread pans are now unused\n",
    "\nFirst of all, they aren\u0027t really intended for the novice user, but they are perfect for the long run. The wooden ones WILL rot before you ever get skilled with them, but these stainless steel ones will take a licking and keep on picking.\n\nOne thing the description doesn\u0027t say, is that they ARE made to be used as chopsticks and they can really function like them. \n\nMaybe on the descriptions from before they said they are slippery and they don\u0027t have any grip. I never had any problem with that depending on what I tried to grab. I was able to grab chopped steaks and even some vegetables with these utensils, though I haven\u0027t tried noodles yet.\n\nAnother thing I need to point out that the description doesn\u0027t. These utensils aren\u0027t round. The handles are square, as the points are rounded. The tips are blunted so grabbing things becomes awkward until you learn to get \"around\" the item you want to pick up. If you know how to use chopsticks and pick up things with them, you\u0027ll only have a very slight adjustment to make with these.\n\nAll in all, for their originality and how they are made, I give them a four and a half out of five.\n\nIf you wanted chopsticks to replace fickle and often unwashable wooden ones, these are the kind you want to get, definately\n",
    "\nMy mother is Korean and so I grew up using stainless steel chopsticks.  Apparently they\u0027re quite popular in Korean households...as well as stainless steel rice bowls.  You might have seen them, the ones with the stainless lids?\n\nAnyway.  These are just like the ones I grew up using.  There are some drawbacks (like the noodle comment made earlier) but it\u0027s not a product flaw.  Yes, wooden chopsticks are going to grip better, but they also tend to mildew if used repeatedly and have to be restocked.  Lacquer coated wooden chopsticks tend to flake after a while.  And besides, when eating asian food you don\u0027t really pick up individual noodles (which would have you slipping and sliding).  You sorta grab a large portion and bring your face close to the bowl and slurp them down.  I think the Japanese actually bring the bowl to their face instead.  Trust me...it all goes where it needs to.  \n\nThe main thing is getting use to their diameter.  These are much more slender than the wooden chopsticks you see in restaurants.  Not for the novice chopsticker\n",
    "\nI have this and mini-pans and muffin pans - all silicone. They are great. The biggest problem is that the bread tends to expand the sides of the soft pan so the sides are a bit wider.

You can do a decent job cleaning it and I plan to clean it well with my ShopVac to extend the life. The vacuum and accessories fit nicely into the stand. I would definitely recommend this product for quick vaccums around the house and in the car\n",
    "\nMy husband drinks coffee continuously. Whenever we are in the car, I\u0027m always after him not to spill his coffee and I constantly have to clean up the inevitable spills. We could never find a good cup that would fit in the cup holder so the spills were always on the floor or in his lap. This cup does spill if it\u0027s tipped over (I don\u0027t think any cup will ever be completely spill proof) but it fits in the cup holder and therefore doesn\u0027t spill as easily. I bought two, one for him and one for me (I drink ice water and tea) and they both fit together nicely side-by-side in our cars cup holder. They keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for long periods of time. I have purchased loads of cups over the 34 years of our marriage and this has to be the best by far. I would highly recommend this item for everyone!\n",

    "\nI used metal muffin pans before, the muffins will never come out without the help of a knife, even the pan was sprayed. \nOn the other side, I am very satisfied with the Kitchenaid product, becuase beautiful muffins come right out, when turn the pan unside down (need to apply cooking spray before baking). \nYes, it did have some plastic smell during baking for the first couple times. After that, no smell at all. \n\nI chose not to pay $5 extra for the rack, still it works well with a cookie tray. \n\nThe only negative comment is the unerasble marks left by grease(oil/cooking spray) on the surface. I am not complaining about it, as it states clearly in the instructions, and it does not affect baking. \n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with this product, and I will buy more for my new kitchen.\n",

I\u0027m not sure about the flavored syrups, but I just add some flavored coffee creamer (international delight or coffee mate) to the container and it makes it taste so good.

The outlast material needs to be pretty close to your body to work - and it DOES have a distinctive texture that is a broad weave box pattern and is \"stiff\" (..though after a few washings it becomes considerably softer).  You might not like this textural feeling.\n\n2. Other than the outlast, the pillow is nothing special.  The support is poor like most pillows, the interesting thing here though is that you can remove the stuffing - and fill it with a material you find acceptable (..if you don\u0027t like the standard poly fill), but you will need to do some minor sewing on the seam you opened to remove and replace the filling\n",

    "\nThe feature\u0027s on this machine are what drew me to choose Krups Espresso Maker. The pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw. The water tank and its size, not having to fill it every day. The fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it. And nobody makes a frothier frother than Krups makes. I love the lattes and I use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher. You can make two cups at once. I use it daily and sometimes more than once a day! It makes a great espresso with beautiful crema. I have not had any problems with this machine.Clean after every use. I can\u0027t stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area. And do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups.  Follow cleaning instructions! \nI highly recommend this one! Enjoy\n",
    "\nMy husband, (a Jaguar lover), calls this the \"E-Type of Toasters\"!  It is beautifully designed; requires minimal space and is \u0027simply\u0027 sophisticated.  To achieve the \"perfect toast\" using our old toaster required toasting a slice of bread three times, turning it twice, - now it\u0027s one single click.\nKitchen appliances wouldn\u0027t be hidden away inside the cabinet if they were designed as elegantly as Braun\u0027s Impressions Toaster\n",
    "\nI love to have a dinner party with a cake in this case.  It\u0027s elegant and gets compliments from all.  I have found it to be sturdy enough, as mine came in one piece and is not broken or cracked.  This is a very nice case.  Cake looks even more tempting\n",
    "\nThis is a wonderful appliance and at what a savings!  Mine arrived promptly and in \"shipped from the manufacturer\" condition.  This is such an improvement over my old waffle maker (no matter how much I greased it the waffles always stuck).\n\nThe first time I tried it was on my new son-in-law and I was eager to make a good impression.  A red light indicates the appliance is on and a green light tells you when it\u0027s ready to cook.  My first waffle came out beautifully and you-know-who ate it with great satisfaction and requested another.  Then I screwed up.  You see, if you don\u0027t follow directions and forget to rotate the waffle maker your waffle splits in half and can\u0027t be put back together again!  Third time I did it right.\n\nWaffle grids slide out easily for cleaning in the dishwasher.  Outside of stainless steel appliance my be cleaned with soap and water or glass cleaner if you prefer.  Handle folds down and therefore the appliance stores easily.\n\nI was too busy to follow the gram instructions in the recipe booklet accompanying the waffle maker and too busy to beat egg whites separately.  So I used my tried and true pancake recipe which turned out great.  In the future I\u0027ll be more creative!\n\nHighly recommended for waffle lovers\n",
    "\nThis unit does everything it is designed to do.  Have used it several times now and the only question we have is, when do we change the oil? ..... we think it\u0027s kinda like your car, if it looks and smells bad .... dump it ... grin !\n",
    "\nAt $20 and free shipping this is probably the best deal around for people on a buget. Realistly the retail value is not $80 it is around $40. The fabric is not all that soft however with a few washings it should be great. If the thead count bothers you like some other reviewers spend more money don\u0027t complain about it when it\u0027s plainly listed. An easy way to solve that problem if you are on a tight budget now is to buy it and then later buy a duvet to make the comforter softer. The only reason I deducted a star is because the bed ruffle is very flimsy. It feels like it would tear very easily. This is not a problem for me as I find them annoying but may bother some people. All in all I think it is a great deal\n",

    "\nI love this product , the processor is small but enough for a home kitchen and it doesn\u0027t take up much space. It chops , shred , slice but the bad thing is sometimes when making sticky stuff, the stuff goes under the thing that holds the blade and its extremly hard to get out. The other bad thing is the plastic , everytime I use the processor the smell of what I\u0027m making last in the plastic bowl and won\u0027t go away until I make something else. And I did clean it very hard. Overall I do Recommend this product to All\n",
    "\nI had the same wok for four of the five years that I lived in China.  It was made of the same type of carbon steel as this one.  When I came back to the USA last year, I looked all around for this kind of wok and was very happy to find it.\n\nMy wife, a native of southwestern China, joined me in the USA this year.  She thoroughly approved of my choice.  And, boy, does she make the best stir fried vegetables in the world.\n\nTrue, it is heavy, but that is good news because now we have an electric stove and the thick steel helps distribute the heat well. (In China we had a gas stove with a huge flame.)\n\nI still don\u0027t understand all the rituals involved with \"seasoning.\"  In China I was taught to scrub it hard after cooking with a stainless steel or brass scrubber in hot soapy water, then dry it very well before heating it just a little and rubbing it down with oil (we use a paper towel) on the inner surface.  Store it oiled!  Rarely have we had any sticking problems.\n\nA little scrubbing gets the rust right off if you forget to dry and oil, so don\u0027t panic!\n\nThis is a fairly priced (at around $25), good piece of equipment for cooking \"real\" Chinse food\n",
    "\nThe Kitchen Aid hand mixer is actually more than I expected.  It is light weight, easy to use, and has attachments that other mixers don\u0027t usually have.  While it is more expensive than your average hand mixer, I definitely feel I got my money\u0027s worth.  I have other Kitchen Aid products and they last forever. I have never been disappointed in their performance. \n",

I am happy with it. \n\nI was also happy with the delivery of the product...it arrived within the week and was well package to prevent damage\n",
    "\nGreat invention!   I drink mostly loose teas, gave up coffee some time ago.   Because of work and being \"Mom\", I spend a lot of time in my car.  I have tried several travel presses and most of them don\u0027t trap all of the leaves under the press, especially leaves that unroll as they steep.  This is the most practical travel mug that I\u0027ve ever seen and the storage compartment is absolutely great for carrying extra loose tea for those all day meetings.  I ordered one for my desk and one for those long car trips\n",
    "\nI was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable. I thought a french press would be a great idea, but all of them seemed to be made of glass and I didn\u0027t want to leave my press laying around where I work (we share space with other companies so people come and go). With this mug all I have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea (and maybe some sugar). Wait a bit, push down the press and drink. The whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber. The bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh. \n\nI read another review of the mug somewhere and they complained about getting coffee grinds coming through. Well let me say this mug has a double filter, one on the plunger part of the press and one on the lid where you drink or pour from. Coffee used for french press preperation is supposed to be a coarse grind. I think that person tried using store bought ground coffee or just didn\u0027t know any better and put finely ground coffee in. The mug will do a pretty good job even with coffee like that, but some is bound to get through that way and you get a muddy cup besides the point so use coffee made for french press brewing not finely ground coffee and you will love this mug\n",
    "\nThe effectiveness of this dutch oven lies in its design which served chuck wagons a century ago and campers today!  Cast Iron is ALWAYS a good value for the money and it\u0027s indestructable (I\u0027m still using my mother\u0027s Lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954). This dutch oven, designed specifically for the camp or fireplace cook, goes from the fire to the table with ease. It stews and bakes beautifully - get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis! Also makes a fabulous wedding, shower, or housewarming gift. Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a lodge dutch oven and skillet. She\u0027ll hand them down to the next generation. Every camper can use this and so can every backyard griller. Highly recommend!\n",
    "\nI have used a Brita filter water pitcher for many years, and I love it!

Because I didn\u0027t have a clue on which brand was good or bad, many of the reviews for mushroom/egg slicers were mixed, so I took a stab in the dark, and came up a winner!!  This is a great product, stores easily, and works well.  The curve where you put the mushroom (or egg) is just the right size and is just a wonderful time saver!  I love it\n",
    "\nHonestly... I do not, for the likes of me, understand why anyone would give this cookware a bad review.  It appears that those who have, either can\u0027t read or didn\u0027t bother.\n\nWe have had our set of Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick for several months, and everyone in the family (mom, dad, two teenage sons) uses them.

    "\nI have bought this timer numerous times, and, after a few years, after it falls into a pot of soup or something, I go buy another. Reasons: a) the programmable timer which allows you to time several dishes simultaneously. b) Sturdiness. Its magnet does not stay glued to the back forever, but otherwise it\u0027s durable for an everyday electronic gadget - you should get several years of use out of it. c) It\u0027s one of the only timers I can find - and I look at big box stores, major discount stores, the supermarket, etc. - that allow you to time dishes longer than an hour or 99 minutes. This is important for pot roast, big chickens, turkeys, unusual dishes that simmer overnight, and so on. \n\nI recently bought it at Amazon because the big box store where I used to get it, now only carries from Pyrex a much more complex version which you don\u0027t need for everyday cooking.   \n",
    "\nIn my opinion this is the best kitchen timer out there!  \n\nIt has FOUR separate programmable digital timers that can count up and/or down - each with their own alarm sound.  It also has a regular clock setting.  Plus, you can either plop it on the fume hood using the magnet on the back of it, clip it to your apron using the clip or set it on the counter using it\u0027s support stand.  Oh, and did I mention how small it is?...just another nice feature! \n\nSo yeah, no more having to set the oven timer, the microwave timer and my watch timer in order to keep track of all the various foods cooking at the same time.\n\nNot only do I use this timer in the kitchen constantly I also use it for numerous other things too.  It\u0027s the \"Time Out\" timer for the kids, a ten-minute reminder when I need to get us all out of the house...you name it!\n\nMy Mother owns this same timer and is the one that originally introduced me to it, thank heavens!  I can\u0027t imagine running a kitchen without this hard to find item.  If you check out Bed, Bath \u0026 Beyond you\u0027ll see they don\u0027t have anything with FOUR programmable timers.\n\nLong story short...if you purchase this timer I promise you will NOT be disappointed.\n\n",
    "\nLe Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products. Le Creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once. For this reason, one pot may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. \n\nCast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. It is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat. However, there are exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so are these cooking vessels. \n\nCast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn\u0027t add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain your cooking vessel. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood. \n\nThe benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the buffet casserole specifically. The buffet casseroles are one of the most versatile pieces in the Le Creuset lineup.  Use this pan as a saut� pan, a roasting pan, for poaching, or as a shallow braiser.  The 3.5 quart capacity can is plenty of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. The buffet casserole tends to do best if at least three quarters full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with the evenly dispersed heat in the pot. \n\nWith a large flat bottom that curves up this pan resembles a curved sided saute pan the only thing missing would be a long handle. The tight fitting lid is mostly flat with curved sides. This lid seals in heat, moisture, and flavors and can be used to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings. Its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan. \n\nI tend to use this pot for basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else. But once you get past the basic functionality that lends itself to recipes such as paella, frittatas, deep dish pizza, and casseroles, you can really open up the possibilities.  Keep in mind this is a 3.5 quart pan, feeding two out if it is ridiculous unless you want leftovers. It is probably the perfect size for a family of four in most cases.  Try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding for when you need to please many guests, poaching fish, or Mac and Cheese. The possibilities almost seem endless. \n\nOne feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn\u0027t seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of.\nPROS: \nExtremely versatile \nEfficient absorption and distribution of heat \nHygienic enamel cooking surface \nDoes not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors \nEasy to clean when not abused or misused \nCan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table \nCan easily last a lifetime \n\nCONS: \nIts heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 12.25 pounds\n",

Plus, the iron is always at the right temperature for whatever I\u0027m ironing, and its easy to fill with water.

    "\nI bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it\u0027s still working perfectly.  It\u0027s so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days.

I\u0027ve recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can\u0027t live without it now.\n\nFew things of note:\n\n* Even with Vacu Vin, the wine will start to change flavor if kept over a week.\n\n* You do need to pump a lot more than the instruction indicates.  Keep pumping until you feel a strong resistance.\n\n* Vacu Vin cannot be used for wines with fizz (such as Vino Verde, Champagne, etc).  The reduced pressure will suck the gas out of the wine and make it flat very quickly.\n\n* It\u0027s better to keep the bottle upright so there\u0027s no pressure on the rubber stopper (It does not need to stay moist like a cork).\n\nIts purpose is to keep a leftover wine until you finish it, and it does that quite well\n",

After getting my three sets in the mail, I went to my grocery store, bought the Starbucks Sumatra whole beans, ground them to expresso grind, and went to try the ecopads. I followed the instructions, put the ecopad in the machine (perfect fit), hit the 8oz button, and wa - la! I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the stuff you pay $3.50 a cup for at Starbucks. I\u0027m definately hooked. I can\u0027t see how other reviewers have had problems with these. They are easy to fill, and fit perfectly in the machine. They are a bit messy to clean up, but its a fair trade off for the awesome coffee and the cost savings over the pods or actually going to starbucks. I would estimate I will get 50-60 cups out of a $6 store bought bag of coffee. Basically, one heaping teaspoon fills up the ecopad perfectly. Also I would estimate getting hundreds of uses out of each ecopad - they seem very durable. I am looking forward to trying different coffee\u0027s with these. Well worth the tiny investment\n",

    "\nI have had my grill for a week, we\u0027ve cooked lean steaks on it, pork chops, and the other night we cooked hamburgers on it.  This is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the \"George Foreman\" grill was a bit faster, I was amazed I thought the Delonghi cooked pretty fast!!  Clean up was really easy and one MUST remember to preheat it.  I gather some have not.  And as to smoking I haven\u0027t had any but then I buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if I think the food will drip a lot of fat.  Fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke.  I\u0027ve only used water once, with the hamburgers (no smoking).  This really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying (actual cooking space is 15\"x11\").  Ease and comfort of use is amazing.  I highly recommend it!\n",

Stainless versus nonstick is now my preference virtually all of the time.  For skillet chicken, this is the absolute best you can do for a perfectly browned end result.

    "\nI purchased the Cuisinart grinder from Amazon based upon customer reviews just over two years ago after trying two cheaper $20-ish models picked up at local discount stores.  Motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order; the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2-3 months in a storage building. The motor on the Cuisinart is still going strong, but I had to trash it today.  I have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1-3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight,  but that\u0027s to be expected with a blade grinder.  The on/off button broke about 2 months ago; then, last week, the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite John Conti beans.  Others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models, but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee!  If I don\u0027t try a higher quality burr grinder, I may get another one of these! \n",
    "\nI purchased this French press for my husband several weeks ago and I love it. Happy with the regular coffee maker, I had little interest in the item until I saw it in action for the first time. It\u0027s so easy to use and the flavor of the coffee is much smoother. It\u0027s also beautiful. I purchased two matching cups at the same time and they remind me of Russian tea glasses---a collecting favorite of mine. I highly recommend this all-around good buy\n",
    "\nThis is a decent unit.  For those who don\u0027t take the time to read or can\u0027t understand what they read the product listing states the scoop included is for a 4 ounce cup(4 x 4 is 16).  The usual sold in the US coffeemaker is a 4-6 ounces per cup capacity.  Coffee instructions say usually measures are for a 6 ounce cup.  A cup is not what you use or the standard liquid 8 ounce cup.  Most advertised 10 and 12 cup coffeemakers hold the same total amount in the carafe. The manufacturer calcultaes what will sell.  This has been going on since I bought my first coffeemaker 30 years ago. Caveat emptor! \n",
    "\nThe Model 40053 is a good effort, but misses the mark compared to the now-discontinued West Bend Model 40032 Triple Timer, sold in the 1980s and 1990s.  I don\u0027t need a real-time clock, nor a stopwatch in a kitchen timer, because they just complicate the device.\n\n* Water resistance;\n* distinctive alarms for each channel;\n* superbright blinking LED secondary alarm indicator for loud environments;\n* blinking LCD indicator for each active timing channel;\n* shirt pocket size, countertop stability;\n* single-hand programmability, and\n* memory recall for easy repeat timing\n\n-- that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to see in an improved version of the 40032.  Perhaps customer pressure can get West Bend to bring something like that to the market\n",

    "\nI love this steamer because it fits in All Clad sauce pans from 2 to 4 quarts.  The other version with the long handle doesn\u0027t fit the 2-quart.\n\nWorks beautifully.  Easy to care for (dishwasher safe). \n",
    "\nIf you love to prepare food, these measuring cups are for you. They are very well made and are fairly heavy. No cheap metal here. They feel good in your hand. If cooking is as much of an art as a necessity to you, these  will make an excellent addition to your kitchen\n",
    "\nThis maker is the better of the two pod coffee machines I had. It is easy to make your own pods that work very well and you have much better coffee due to fresh grind. My problem was that the part that catches when you close the lid broke. It probably was mostly my fault but it is made of plastic unlike the metal one on the other pod maker I have. That is why the other one still works and the Juan Valdez is broken. IF you are careful not to overfill your homemade pods you\u0027d probably never have a problem with it. Just be careful in closing it and don\u0027t force it\n",
    "\nI got this for Christmas over a year ago, and it still works great!  I use it most every morning.  The coffee quality isn\u0027t as good as my drip maker - no pod coffee maker can ever measure up to a drip maker - but it\u0027s very easy to brew just one cup and with no cleanup (except to remove the used pod!).\n\nI agree with the other reviewer that the Juan Valdez coffee pods come in excessive packaging (individually wrapped pods inside a cardboard box), plus my grocery store doesn\u0027t carry them.  Any brand pod can be used with this coffee maker.  I use whatever\u0027s cheapest, usually the Senseo Douwe Egberts.  I buy either the dark roast or the vanilla flavored.  I prefer strong coffee, but even the dark roast pods aren\u0027t strong enough for me.\n\nI wish I had the black-colored machine because the white shows every single coffee stain\n",

How much fun is that to clean up your microwave carousel before you can eat?  \n\nBut this bowl is big enough to handle the bubbling.  Just take a kitchen towel under it against the heat and you will be cozy in your terrycloth robe on the couch for some nice potato-ing\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve used my pan twice before reviewing. The first time was corn muffins and they came out really well. They muffins popped out with ease.\n\nThe second time I made lemon cupcake with white chocolate chips, and it was harder. The pan was hard to transport to the oven full of batter. Halfway through baking, the batter drips onto the oven floor, causing me to put a muffin tin under the pan. When baked and cooled, the cupcakes broke while popping out\n",
    "\nI dont think it was as bad as the reviews imply.  I\u0027ve had mine about 6 months now and it still works fine, the only complaint I have is about the settings as one person said it can be the exact same on both sides and yet one side will \"burn\" and one be \"underdone\".  I just adjusted these and turned them so they both cook whatever I\u0027m making right, even though it is off by one number compared to the other side.  So thats a fluke for sure which would make it worth buying one without any problems, but frankly I\u0027ve yet to find such a toaster.  Other then that I\u0027ve had no problems with this one, I love the look and style of it as well it is so cute and practical other then the above problem.  I would recommend this toaster but as I got it as a gift I probably wouldnt spend the $50 but would gladly pay $30 for it.  I dont think you can really find a better toaster I\u0027ve done the cheap kmart specials and frankly those dont last as long as this has without much worse problems or burning. \n",
    "\nI researched many roaster pans before I settled on this and am I glad I did. It offers a truly stovetop worthy construction, no bending or warping, a great v rack, and superb heat distribution. The handles are comfortable and the pan fits perfectly in the oven. Compared to the AllClad, it is less expensive and better performance. A well thought out pan\n",
    "\nI love the way cast iron cooks.  Not to mention it is so nice to spend less on something that lasts longer and is easier to clean up!\n\nI do have problems lifting things sometimes, but this is about the same amount of work as the non-stick pans that I used to have, although slightly heavier, the handles are ergonomic and the loop on the other side of the handle compensates by making a balanced lifting motion easier.\n",
    "\nLisa S from Ohio complains that the knives rust very easily and that this is a buyer-beware item.  This is not a buyer beware item. This is an item that requires some knowledge about use and care of carbon steel knives. Carbon steel is an alloy which allows one to hone a very keen edge and it is used for very fine cutting tools in general. It does rust very easily and should always be dried after washing, and even wiped with a little olive oil. These knives cannot be left sitting in dishwater, and they should never be run through a dishwasher. If you want to throw your kitchen knives into a dishwasher, buy cheap stainless steel ones\n",
    "\nI have recived serveral comments on how good these knifes look. I am in fact very pleased with the way they look, but even more important is how well they perform. They cut wonderfully (for me at least, but I\u0027m used to cheapy knifes). Yes they will in fact rust, although I haven\u0027t had this problem with my set (had them for about four months now) because I only handwash them and dry them immediately.  One steak knife found it\u0027s way into the dishwasher and sure enough it came out with a little rust spot, this was easily removed with a little steel wool.  You just have to weight the benefits of the all metal knifes to those that are wood handled or plastic\n",
    "\nThis little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn\u0027t bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt.\nAll in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one\u0027s for you\n",

The spoons and forks seem to do just fine in the dishwasher so I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with the knives. I\u0027m assuming they\u0027re made differently. Gourmet Settings, the manufacturer, does have a warranty on the flatware so if you buy this set you may want to, or have to, make use of this\n",

I\u0027ve bought 3 of these and I couldn\u0027t get all of the \"glue\" off any of the boards.  I eventually just put the oil on the boards to protect them and that somehow helped get most of the sticky residue off.

However...and this is a significant however...a good decanter should be as broad as possible at the level at which a full bottle of wine will fill it. The idea is to have as large an air-to-wine interface as possible, so as to let as much wine as possible \u0026quot;breathe\u0026quot;. This of course is not terribly important for whites and better reds, but younger red wines benefit considerably from being decanted for an hour before they are drunk.

It did not smell at all on first use (many pots have that reputation).  It is very attractive and fits nicely on my countertop.  The inner ceremic part is very sturdy and cleans up very easily.  I do recommend for first-time users that you purchase one good cookbook (many are carried on Amazon).

(and when i am not i store it in my oven)  i use it almost every day.  the grill side works great for bacon, salmon, hamburgers, chicken--anything when i don\u0027t feel like firing up the grill.  so far everything turns out perfect, not too dry.  the griddle side is great for pancakes and eggs and truly non-stick without the chemicals of a coating to worry about.  The bottom line is...I love this product more than any other kitchen item since my kitchen aid mixer (another love of mine).  i plan to buy more as gifts for all my family and friends with gas stoves (I am not sure how well it works with electric eyes).  truly a kitchen basic.  if you are thinking of getting one, you should\n",

That\u0027s 8-10 hours a day in a room with flourescent lighting!\n\nWhen I would come in, I would feel foggy and depressed and unmotivated.  When I would leave, I would feel blinded by the light outside and out of sorts.\n\nSo I bought this lamp on a whim from a Sharper Image Store.  It comes with a brushed steel lampshade, but the store also gave me a white translucent vinyl shade which is what I wound up using.  The light is softly diffused around my workspace.  I can increase or decrease the intensity of the light using the dimmer dial.  And honestly, whether it\u0027s psychological or whatever, I feel SO much better since I plugged this thing in!

    "\nI have owned my fair share of indoor grills, from a Foreman grill to a really heavy grill pan which I ordered through Amazon. Not too long ago I recently acquired the Calphalon grill pan because my Foreman grill is too small if I want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time. Plus the black coating on my Foreman grill is wearing out. So I bought the Calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store. I haven\u0027t been able to get enough of it. It is so easy to clean even when I had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in Italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed, garlic, shallots, and extra virgin olive oil. The marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it wasn\u0027t non-stick. I also like using the Calphalon grill pan because I can cook both the meat and vegetable (say asparagus) at the same time. The results are fabulous. I get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste. Although it is a bit big for this apartment dweller, I still consider this grill pan the best of all the indoor grills I have owned. Well worth the money too\n",
    "\nI\u0027m thoroughly impressed by this set of inexpensive skillets: each of the three are the right size for my use:  Small skillet for nice round pancakes, larger skillet for general stir-fry, the griddle for bacon, eggs and toasting bread (with more than enough real-estate to cook two of three at the same time - could have crammed in the bacon but that releases too much fat).  \n\nThe best part about this entire set is that it cleans up so well - i\u0027m coming from some lousy Tefal (remember when they were actually a premium brand with good quality? those times have long gone) which stained really badly, not to mention the nonstick flaking off after a couple uses.  I\u0027ve even tried some of the el-cheapo calphalons (another premium brand going downhill) from amazon and they chip and wear fast right out of the box.\n\nI\u0027m now a convert to farberwear - they are inexpensive and has really held up to the test of time (this is in reference to my stainless-steel set I purchased right after college 10 years ago - they\u0027re still going strong and is testament to their quality even if they don\u0027t have the name or pricing to show for it).\n\n",

    "\nWe needed a small countertop dishwasher for our rec room, and after a few months of use, I can say this one is working out very well.\n\nIt shipped quickly, with no damage (the box was pretty tattered, but the packing material and the actual dishwasher were fine). It\u0027s large for a countertop device, certainly bigger than most microwaves. Be sure to measure your available space, especially clearance to any cabinets above your installation site.\n\nI hit some minor bumps getting it installed. The dishwasher hose nozzle is supposed to connect to your kitchen faucet using a threaded  quick-connect coupler included in the box. The coupler is supposed to screw onto the end of the faucet, but the faucet on that sink was a removeable spray handle on a long hose. There\u0027s no way for the included adapter to hook up to this, so I wound up having to install a new faucet (this isn\u0027t as bad as it sounds, as we were planning to replace the old one anyway).\n\nI brought the quick connect adapter to the hardware store with me to be sure it would fit the threads on the new faucet. Everything seemed okay in the store, but when I got home and installed the new faucet, I had some trouble. It turns out that the included adapter isn\u0027t particularly good quality, and didn\u0027t fit the faucet threads tightly enough to stay in place once the water pressure was actually turned on.\n\nI blew the hose nozzle off the end of the new faucet a couple of times until I finally went back to the hardware store and picked up an off-the-shelf adapter. Fortunately, it looks like Danby is using all standard-sized parts, so I was able to replace the flaky adapter with a new one that works well for only a couple of dollars.\n\nOnce I had the thing up and running, it was easy to load and use. The basket is built to hold four full place settings, but I find that with some creative jiggering I can get it to take in any odd collection of dishes, mugs, baby cups, storage containers and what have you. The basket insert is removeable, converting it to an all-glasses tray, which we found useful for party cleanup.\n\nThe machine really heats the water, so dishes come out clean. Even sticky stuff like melted cheese usually cleans right up. I\u0027ve never had to use the heat-boost \"sanitize\" setting.\n\nIt uses a very small amount of dishwasher soap and rinse fluid, and you want to be careful NOT to add too much. I made the mistake of overfilling the soap holder (spilled a little too much, figured it would just rinse out, oops) and wound up flooding my countertop in suds. This has only happened once and there was no damage. Call it a learning experience.\n\nI saw in some of the other reviews that the timer knob occasionally won\u0027t advance when you start running the machine, and this did happen to me once as well after I\u0027d had it for about two weeks. It hasn\u0027t recurred since then, either becuase I\u0027ve been particularly careful to set the timer in the right start position, or the timer\u0027s \"wearing in.\"\n\nBeen using it steadily several times a week for a few months now, and after the initial hiccups, it\u0027s been working fine. No complaints, and now I\u0027m looking for a Danby under-counter mini-refigerator to replace one in the same rec room. I\u0027d recommend this dishwasher, provided you don\u0027t mind a little effort getting it dialed in\n",

    "\nI love these dishes.  They are lead-free and you can do so much with them because they are a solid color.  I liked the sea mist color even more when I saw the actual dishes--it is very soothing to the eye, and I don\u0027t think that I will get tired of it as I might with one of the brighter or darker colors.  \n\n",
    "\nJust as advertised!  This sharpener is great!  Knives that were very dull now slide right through anything being sliced! Sorry I waited so long to get this sharpener! The price held me back- but it\u0027s worth every penny\n",
    "\nYou are going to LOVE this mug.  I bought it in the curry yellow, and ended up buying three more. The finish is beautiful and the shape fits your hand so well.  It is like satin as you hold it and it keeps your tea warm and wonderful.  The lip is perfect and not too thick.  Buy one and see!! Chantal products are the best.  Check out their soup bowls\n",
    "\nHad to turn in the first unit I bought for a replacement because a small plastic piece on the filter basket door broke, rendering the door useless.  The replacement has worked fine, but I am very careful in swinging the door open.\nCan\u0027t understand the nitpicking of other reviewers on the spillage when pouring from the carafe, and the forming of air bubbles in the water level tube.  Both problems are easily solved by pouring slowly enough.\nAs to the peeling of the coating on the heating plate, I haven\u0027t had that happen either in the original unit or the replacement.\nI agree the instructions for setting the time on the clock and for the timer are a little complex - every time we have a power outage I have to refer to the manual to reset times.  However, the timer feature has worked without fail, unlike the Mr. Coffees I\u0027ve had.\nI need to add that the poor visibility of the display is annoying.  Unless I\u0027m missing something, it\u0027s backlit only when the unit is on or you\u0027re resetting times.\nEvery coffeemaker has its pros and cons, for this one the pros far outweigh the cons. Overall, a fine machine which makes great coffee (hint: if you disagree with the great coffee try one of the Caribou coffees - the combination is terrific)\n",
    "\nMy wife and I selected the Krups FME-4 coffee maker to replace the Braun KF550-BK model we\u0027ve used for the last 2 years.  The Braun was, and still is, an excellent machine.  But it lacked a timer, which the Krups has.\n\nThe Krups has a good clock/timer system that can be a little confusing, unless you read the manual (self-explanatory).  The display uses an LCD that can be difficult to view from some angles.  Overall, it works okay.\n\nThe construction of the Krups is what bothers me the most.  My Braun coffee maker has a filter holder that can stand upright on the counter while I\u0027m filling it with grounds.  This is really useful.  Unfortunately, the filter holder for the Krups is not designed to stand on a counter, so I have to replace it in the coffee maker unit or hold it with my free hand while adding grounds.  This is a big annoyance.\n\nAlso, the review that mentions the uselessness of the water-level indicator on the side of the unit is completely accurate.  Bubbles form in the indicator, making it impossible to read.  Few things bother me as much as a feature that looks great on the packaging, and that\u0027s all.\n\nRegarding the carafe, yes, it does spill; but, only if you try to pour too fast.  I had the same problem with my Braun, and just backing off on the angle of the carafe while pouring is enough to keep the coffee in the cup.\n\nOverall, there are some critical design flaws that really shouldn\u0027t be present in such a frequently used product; but, it makes good coffee and is fairly simple to use.  In hindsight, I might have instead bought the Braun KF580-BK, which is identical to my current model plus a clock/timer\n",
    "\nWe\u0027re a busy family of four. This product has so many more uses than our old toaster plus it cooks fast \u0026 it\u0027s simple to use! This has been a great alternative to heating up the oven for a few pieces of cheese bread or a snack pizza. I was surprised at how evenly everything cooks. We\u0027ve been very pleased with this product, in fact it has become an essential appliance. The only draw back is that it takes up more counter space however that con is overweighed by all the pros. I never thought I\u0027d give up my old toaster, now I wish I\u0027d done it ten years ago! \n",
    "\nI love Corelle and purchased this for my son and his new wife. The item was not able to be delivered and I received a quick no hassle refund. Amazon is very easy to deal with!\n",
    "\nFor those of you that enjoy cooking and the best for your kitchen, these dutch ovens are a must!  Excellent for slow cooked stews, roasts and soups.  Wonderful heat retention with the cast iron core and the enamel coating keeps it a snap to clean.  No sticking and no taste or metal reactions plus the colors are so attractive, they can be a really nice accent in your kitchen. \n",
    "\nI pretty much agree with ILikeAmazon\u0027s review below.  This blender looks nice, sounds quiet and doesn\u0027t dance all over the kitchen when being used.  The lid stays put and it\u0027s easy to clean.  It also matches all my other small Kitchen Aid appliances.  Like others though, I make a smoothie every morning and I\u0027ve had to learn how to use this blender for that.   First, it\u0027s helpful to let any frozen items sit for awhile in the blender (I load it as soon as I get water on for my coffee so it can sit until the last thing I do before leaving the house).  \n\nIf pushed for time, then I\u0027ve found that putting the blender on pulse and constantly pulsing until the contents agitate on their own helps.  The problem is that either the funnel shaped bottom and/or the blades being turned in several directions pushes the frozen mush above the funnel shaped bottom of the blender.  Air enters the funnel shaped bottom and the mush calmly just sits above the blades.  At this point, the blender can be stopped and the mush gently pushed back down into the funnel before restarting the blender.  \n\nKitchen Aid products (and their customer service) are superior.  This blender is a nice addition to my kitchen.  As ILikeAmazon said:  \"There are always tradeoffs.\"  I do hope however that they improve on the smoothie making capabilities of this powerful, attractive blender.  Then it will be a five star appliance.\n\nBy the way:  I like Amazon too! \n",
    "\nI was looking for a kettle with a handle that I could pick up without using an oven mitt, and one that doesn\u0027t require removal of the whistle (also with oven mitt of course) before pouring.  This kettle fit the bill.  The handle as well as the whistle are plastic and cool to the touch.  The whistle flips up with a touch of your thumb and does not require removal.\n\nI have been pleasantly surprised by the kettle beyond the two features above (which I would have thought would be standard on every kettle, but that is so not the case).  It looks nice and is sturdily constructed.  The whistle is a gentle reminder, not a screaming alarm.  It holds a lot of water, enough for about 8 cups of tea plus a little water to rinse out/pre-heat the tea pot with.\n\nMy only suggestion for improvement is for the handle.  Because it\u0027s a straight bar across, it\u0027s not very ergonomic for pouring.  I often find my right wrist at a strange, almost uncomfortable angle.  I have solved the problem by using my left hand as well -- first I tilt the kettle with my right hand, then I use my left hand to hold the kettle while it\u0027s pouring.  I think a curved handle would eliminate this problem\n",
    "\nI am quite enamoured with this little utensil.  I bought it because it was the cheapest silicone spatula I found, but it turned out also to be the best designed.  The all-silicone construction not only protects the handle from melting, and you pot from scratching, but makes it the easiest and most comfortable to use as well.\n\nAlso note that most silicone products are only rated for use up to 400F or so, while this is rated to 600F.  I havent used it at temperatures that high, but I\u0027m comforted to know I have that option if the need arises\n",
    "\nThe canister size and shape is very suitable; it properly sized to store easily all of our cold cuts. The part that I do not like is the time it takes to pull the vacuum. It seems that the sides handle are not design to pre-load the cover so will seal the gasket. Design could be improve\n",
    "\nThis is the best can opener I\u0027ve ever used! With arthritis in my hands and wrists I\u0027ve always struggled with can openers. (The electric ones take up valuable counter space and tend to spill the liquid contents.) The Oxo is easy to grip, easy to turn the knob and I appreciate the little jaw-grippy thingy on the side to help seperate the can and lid.\n",
    "\nI use this for more than just tea, defrosting frozen veggies, making broth, a few drops on a sponge for cleaning, this thing is the greatest\n",
    "\nThis bakeware is absolutley the best I have ever had.  It doesn\u0027t stick, rust, or burn.  Super easy to keep clean, just toss in the dishwasher.  I you are a baker you must have this, you will be amazed\n",
    "\nI have used analon cookware since 1997.  The handle came off one of the saucepans.  Before I could return it, my husband tossed it out.  I replaced the saucepan and purchased some additional items.  They arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.  I have used the pots and they have met my expectations.  I would like to order some of the other accessories.\n",
    "\nThis Bundt Pan is great. The Cakes come out cooked evenly, moist, and removes easily from the pan. Made 3 cakes using this pan \u0026 everyone loves them! This bundt pan is going to be used alot more!!! I love it!\n",
    "\nI like the two short handles versus the one big handle on other boilers.  This is a little less obtrusive on the stovetop that the one handle design.  It would not work well for sauces or other tasks where you need your other hand to wisk or stir.\n\nWorks great on the flat top range and cleans up nicely.\n\nHighly recommend, but it seems to be out of stock often\n",
    "\nWe needed to replace a 30 year old Farberware frypan. This pan was better than we expected. We are so grateful for Amazon.com!!\n",
    "\nFarberware classic is great -- an inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots \u0026 pans.  Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots \u0026 pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell.  The newer pots \u0026 pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom.  So, their quality is less than it was; most people who \"grew up with Farberware\" may not realize this.  Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan -- they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers.  Also note: if you are buying a 12\" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section.  I found it to be so absolutely huge -- you could fry a dozen onions in this monster -- that I simply never use it.  The 10\" and 8\" sizes may be what you\u0027re looking for\n",
    "\nive had only great hot drinks from my machine!! i love it\n",
    "\nThese sheets are pretty good--they\u0027re nice and heavy, and I definitely feel like they\u0027re going to last a looooong time.  They are a little bit stiff, and they don\u0027t seem to be softening up too much as time goes on.  I expected them to be a ton softer.  They are really good sheets, however, and I would buy them again\n",
    "\nThe extra long rubber portion of this spatula works very well to scrape down the sides of the bowl as it flexes along the curve of the bowl and reaches the bottom easily\n",
    "\nThis spatula has an easy hold grip, works like it\u0027s supposed to, and washes well in the dishwasher\n",
    "\nJust compare this one with Braun, try to turn it on without the coffee beans and you would notice Braun is louder than Toastmaker, this is quiet and grinds well. Just got it a month ago, not sure about the life of the machine. But I believe its Cheap and Best\n",
    "\nI love garlic and this has been the best garlic press. I\u0027ve use this almost every day for the last 6 months and it still works and looks great! It\u0027s definately worth the money\n",
    "\nThis garlic press is very well made. It\u0027s got some weight to it, but no too much. Works on the biggest cloves of garlic leaving only the skin behind. Well worth the money. Easy to clean\n",
    "\nWe celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years. The Cuisinart TOB-50 is number 4. It\u0027s predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I\u0027m optimistist. We choose it for it\u0027s simplicity, solid feel, and size hoping for reliability and ease of use. In it\u0027s early months it is meeting our expectations. It is one of the most solid and basic that I\u0027ve seen on the market. The controls are solid and easy to use. It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily. My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you don\u0027t want to microwave. The door and the hinges are solid feeling. It is a nice size without being too bulky. We store it inside a cupboard so size was an important factor. It will toast 4 slices of bread or 4 to 6 waffles depending on their size. It has a soft bell to let you know when the heating cycle is done. The crumb pan is easy to use making the unit easy to clean. The only \"con\" I can think of in this unit is that the shelf does not pop forward when you open the door so you need a hot pad or shelf pull to pull it forward safely\n",
    "\nWe had had this oven for a couple months when the door would no longer stay shut.  I tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking, but found this sort of absurd.  So I called Cuisinart for warranty service.  They said they\u0027d replace my oven with a new one, but I had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in NJ and it would take a few weeks.  In the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store, and fixed the problem!  So I wasn\u0027t going to ship the oven to NJ - until a replacement oven arrived...before I even sent the first one out.  Hmmmm.  \n\nAnyway, we\u0027re enjoying this toaster oven very much and use it practically every day.  It is slower than a regular toaster, but cooks four pieces of toast/waffles all at once, so I figure its a fair trade.  It does a nice job with open-faced sandwiches or chicken nuggets for the kids on the broiler pan, without having to heat up our full-sized oven.  A practical choice especially for families with kids\n",
    "\nThe lounger is unique and can be used for watching TV or playing with games. \n",
    "\nI love this thing!  Not only does it perform beautifully, but it\u0027s absolutely gorgeous.  I prefer to serve meals in it rather than one of my pretty platters.\n\nI waited a pretty long time (almost a year) before writing my review to make sure I abused it enough.  This is my 2nd review.\n\nBecause it\u0027s well made, it\u0027s pretty heavy...that\u0027s why the \"helper handle\" is so helpful.  \n\nWe have a chicken salad about 4 times a week so I wanted a really big pan to be able to sear my chicken all at once without having to work in shifts.  \n\nTo clean and sanitize stuff, I put EVERYTHING in the dishwasher...vacuum attachments, toothbrushes, dog and cat toys etc...so the fact that this fits in my dishwasher is awesome for me.  I wash it by hand about 1/2 the time.  \n\nThe nonstick coating is wonderful...not a scrape or scratch on it.  Pay particular attention to cleaning the rivets (that might be the wrong terminology) that attach the handle to the pan on the inside.  The dishwasher gets all the icky stuff out of every crevice, but I use a soft dish brush for the rivets if washing by hand.\n\n:-\n",
    "\nI totally love this pan!\n\nI bake cakes all the time using this and other Hoffritz pans and they are absolutely wonderful. I was first impressed by the weight of the pan, the non-stick sufrace, and the even heat distribution. I noticed a remarkable difference in the quality of my cakes from the very first time I used the pan. Not only do my cakes look and taste great, I never have to worry about my cakes getting stuck to the pan or being lopsided.\n\nI\u0027ll never buy a cheap pan again. It\u0027s really is worth the extra couple of dollars. I doubt I\u0027ll ever have to replace any of the pans I\u0027ve bought from them. I also purchased the Hoffritz springform pans and 9\" rounds, same great results\n",
    "\nI have owned this for years and LOVE it. The directions indicate that for 1 lb of coffee, you add 5 cups of water and let it sit (for hours). I actually add 9 cups of water and the coffee concentrate works just fine. I fill my ice cube trays with the coffee, then bag the cubes so that I can use it over time. It is delicious every time when you put the concentrate in a 3 to 1 ratio with water (American coffee) or less for stronger coffee (e.g., espresso). I particularly like to use these cubes for iced coffee -- it comes out nice and strong, not watered down.\n\nA final bonus to the toddy maker: used coffee grounds are a folk remedy for fire ants. If you have them and you want them gone without throwing a bunch of chemicals in your garden. Put these atop their nest (but watch yourself!). They leave pretty quick. \n\n \n\n",
    "\nThe skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time. The quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet. Its much better then using teflon... (Did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds, especially parrots) Well I never liked cooking in teflon and I have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me. I am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection. Its important to realize, looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven... Those same skillets are still in use today.. Try so to the same about your teflon or stainless steel pan from china. Just a good american made cast iron skillet and its very affordable to!!!\n\n",
    "\nWhat a delightful gadget - works as advertised (how unusual)!  Creates nice slices of mango without the mess and without ending up with all the small slivers of fruit you normally get.  Love it\n",
    "\nI\u0027d purchased the \"big brother\" to this KitchenAid cutting board about a year ago, so I understand the frustration of the reviewers who complain about the apparently unremoveable label. (It sounds petty until you try to scrape it off yourself.) The label DID eventually come off, but it did take a bit of muscle.\n\nSo I\u0027m glad to say that this board arrived, a month or two ago, with no sign of a nasty Kitchenaid label at all. No more wrestling with my kitchen equipment for ME!\n\nAnd, like the larger version of this cutting board, this one really is excellent. It really is non-stick, even when the board is wet (such as when you rinse off the tomato goop before you cut up the scallions). It cleans easily and quickly, and has no objection to the dishwasher. Plus, it looks pretty enough that I don\u0027t mind bringing it to the table, which is more than I can say for most non-wood cutting boards\n",
    "\nWe purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house.  At 14, he is the oldest of 5 - all indoors.  We put it on the bed (his favorite daytime nap spot).  He loves it, but so do the other four.  They all try to squeeze in on it, with him, or take it over when he gets up.  It\u0027s never empty!  It has a bit of a \"crinkly\" noise but they don\u0027t seem to mind it after they try it. It seems to work great and very easy to keep clean.  The patterned side can be de-furred with a few quick swipes of your hand, following the direction of the fabric nap.  Good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats\n",
    "\nGreat thing to own and very useful for cooking small quantity of foods. I use it a lot\n",
    "\nThese beautiful square dishes were the inspiration for my purchase of a complete service for 12 plus serving pieces.  I love them!  They have a very contemporary look, and they are very durable.  What is also nice is the fact that they are larger than your average luncheon/salad plate too\n",
    "\nThis Corelle set has that handcrafted italian detailed look but without worrying about everyday wear-and-tear. It\u0027s time to retire my old butterfly pattern which I\u0027ve had for decades. I rate it four stars only because it would be so much more practical to sell these in SETS OF SIX. It\u0027s more profitable for Corelle but not so practical for us. Yes the bowls are shallow and the mugs are stoneware so they are not break resistant.\n",

He raved about this panini maker so I had to get one for myself.  I LOVE IT!  It is so easy to clean.  It is such a wonderful item that I would\u0027ve paid double the price if I new how well it worked. It\u0027s hard for me to believe that anyone could be disappointed with this item.  \n",

    "\nThis sturdy nylon whisk, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you\u0027ll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.\nIts elegant, stylized shape fits seamlessly with the rest of the OXO Good Grips collection and is designed to the let flow the most air into your creams, meringues, custards and frostings for fluffier, even results. This is also a great tool for whisking directly into the saucepan on the stove, since its non-abrasive nylon materials are safe to use on non-stick cookware and are heat-resistant up to 400 Fahrenheit. Moreover, it comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. \nAfter submitting this product to over three years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new.\n--Reviewed by Maritza Volma\n",
    "\nI have owned at least six other coffee pots and was never satisfied with home made coffee, so Dunkin Donuts was where I would head to on my way to work.  I got this coffee pot and I buy Dunkin Donuts coffee and grind it with the Proline Kitchenaid Grinder and it is the best coffee I have ever had.  Recently I had a kitchen remodel and the electrician showed up with his cup of coffee in hand from Dunkin Donuts.  I asked him later in the day if he wanted a cup of coffee and he was hesitant stating he did not like coffee from home coffee pots.  Well, I assured him he would love it. After having my coffee, for the rest of the week he never showed up with his own coffee, actually said, he preferred my coffee.  After the job was over, he saw my sister a few weeks later and he mentioned how he missed the coffee I made.  This is the best ever, perfect coffee every time and the perfect temperature. \n",
    "\nIf you\u0027re like myself, the 5 a.m. pot of coffee has to be simple.\nWell designed makers keep it almost idiot proof. This one does a great job.Once you learn that the spout is not \"drip proof\", you will be happy with this as a purchase\n",
    "\nWe now have two of these units. They are quieter than other HEPA air filtration units we have had, do a better job of cleaning the air, and have excellent product support.\n",
    "\nEven on its highest setting, it isn\u0027t very loud. Handy electronic screen shows how much longer it is until the filter needs to be washed or vacuumed. I used to wake up in the mornings because I had a stuffy nose due to all the dust where I live, and now that\u0027s gone. I would say this is a worthy investment to anyone who is looking into buying a HEPA filter, but doesn\u0027t want to go broke from the filter costs.\n\nIts CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) is\nTobacco smoke: 145\nDust: 140\nPollen: 130\n\nThis air cleaner is suggested for use in a single closed room up to 227 square feet. I\u0027m using it in a room that\u0027s barely 200 square feet. I can sleep with it on its high setting, but I like white noise, so some may get annoyed with it.

    "\nI like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the \n\"shrink\" bashers of the world. This \"play for effect\" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me\n",

    "\nI\u0027m not sure who\u0027s writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What\u0027s \"fierce\" about that? \n\nThe writing style and content just didn\u0027t flow. Wasn\u0027t real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term \"bucko,\" as in, \"Let me tell you something, bucko.\" What are we in \"Happy Days?\" Couldn\u0027t take the book seriously after that. Very bad.\n",
    "\nI picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn\u0027t matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn\u0027t all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway. \n\nThe setting is the same as the first book, an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation. Fresh off the events of \"The Eyre Affair\", Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes, such as first-edition forgeries, valuable manuscript thefts, and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better), when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen. Unfortunately, the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage. In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poe\u0027s \"The Raven\", and it seems they want him back. \n\nThis a potentially interesting plot, but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix. Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book). Another plotline concerns the discovery of a \"lost\" Shakespeare play, which looks to be the most important literary event of the century, if Thursday can authenticate it. There\u0027s also the small matter of Thursday\u0027s pregnancy. And just when one is comfortable with Thursday\u0027s role as a \"SpecOps Litratech\", and that whole milieu, she\u0027s thrown into an entirely new one as a member of \"Jurisfiction\", a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order... Finally, her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out, and can she help him. Phew!\n\nI\u0027ve probably missed one or two elements, but you get the idea. Fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas, but the shame of it is that he can\u0027t stop and give any of them the attention they deserve. It\u0027s impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he\u0027s just going to move on to something else in a few pages, and it\u0027s impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable, as is time and place. I suppose it\u0027s all meant to be puckish good fun, but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew heroine meets a poor-man\u0027s Douglas Adams. The book has its occasional moments, but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle, and there\u0027s absolutely no narrative tension. All the literary in jokes in the world can\u0027t save this shambling wreck, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be moving on to the next book.\n",
    "\nNot only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as \"isolated instances\" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable\n",
    "\n\u0026quot;I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves.\u0026quot; Voltaire (1755\n",
    "\nThis book was on somebody\u0027s Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it\u0027s obvious that he was involved in the crime. \n\nThere are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead.\n",
    "\nI am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book\n",
    "\nWhen Professor Polk describes the sweep of history in Iraq, he is at his best, but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts.  Much of the political ranting is supposition, marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work. The ranting gets especially tedious towards the end.  My advice, read the first part and skip the last half\n",
    "\nThis is a story of the lives of 5 people who attended college with the author during the early 1980s in post cultural revolution China.  The 5 people live relatively miserable lives, touched by official corruption and incompetence (with the exception of one who benefits handsomely).  China is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality, with widespread corruption, and widespread incompetence.  This view is difficult to reconcile with the economic development and obvious progress that has occurred there in the past 20 years.  This book is an interesting read as gossip often can be, but it is doubtful the 5 people portrayed represent present day China\n",
    "\nThis is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.\n\nThe book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from. \n\nThe book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not\n",
    "\nThis book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger, imperial powers.  Said condemns intellectuals in the West who in his eyes are \"agents of exploitation\".  Yet Said himself is an agent of racism.  \n\nA Pan Arabist, he always supported Arab unity and \"Islam\" at the expense of non-Arab and non-Moslem peoples.  Said directs and manipulates the Western taste for self criticim, and all that does is deflect the world\u0027s attention from Arab and Moslem attrocities committed against Christians, Kurds, Jews, Israelis, Coptic Christians, non-Arab Sudanese, etc.  \n\nThus, reading Said, you would never realize that Sadam Hussein\u0027s poisoning of the Kurds has never been condemned by one Arab intellectual or leader.  This is because a racist prevalent attitude in the Arab mind is that the entire Middle East should be Arab.  This also explains the attitude towards Israel, a country that is predominantly non-Moslem and speaks a Middle Eastern language other than Arabic.\n\nThe pity is that Said himself is a Christian, yet he never spoke on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt, or the right of Christians to practice their faith in Saudi Arabia and probably other places in the Arab World.  He is facilitating the overall aim of PanArab Nationalists by distracting the West from what is happening in the Arab world.  \n\nFor a better understanding of relations between the West and Islam, I recommend books by Bernard Lewis, such as \"The Moslem Discovery of Europe\" and the \"Jews of Islam\".  I also recommend books by the Egyptian scholar and Jewish refugee Yael Bat Yeor, such as \"The Dhimmi\". \n",
    "\nOh, yes - this is a very fine book... for me to poop on! \n\nIn other words, it\u0027s a JOKE book. It\u0027s just another one of a half dozen duds out there, all trying to slam whoever happens to be the #1 retailer at the time - this decade it\u0027s Wal-Mart. \n\nForeign countries paying their workers less? Blame Wal-Mart! Worker insurance prices going sky high because the medical industry over-estimates it\u0027s fees? Blame Wal-Mart! Crooked unions feeling threatened they\u0027ll get their butts kicked by non-union competition? Blame Wal-Mart! Etc., etc.\n\nYou just have to laugh at how these semi-journalistic schlockmeisters try so desperately to compare themselves to a real activist like Micheal Moore, who actually accomplishes some social good once in awhile. \n\nBut you know who\u0027s REALLY laughing? That\u0027s right - Wal-Mart. That\u0027s because they\u0027ve ALREADY built their thousands of stores, and been in business for over 40 years, so it\u0027s way too late now for these mealy-mouthed media wannabes to do anything about it! \n\nAnd what do these ersatz authors expect at this very late date, anyway? That millions of consumers, during these roller-coaster economic times, will be instantly brainwashed by these new crackpot books and then suddenly start to \"boycott lower prices\"? Ha! Ha! Ha! \n\nLike I said, this has got to be just another joke book\n",
    "\nHands down this is Bukowski\u0027s single worst book.  Bought it when it first came out just before/after his death in 1994.  Having read just about everything the man had written, \"Pulp\" was a hugely disappointing epitaph.  If you\u0027ve never read Bukowski start with \"Post Office\" or the short story collections, but avoid this like the plague.  A bad book.  I can\u0027t think of a single reason to recommend it\n",

    "\nFinally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty! Yunnus has proven, by the success of his bank\u0027s loans to the desperately poor, that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support. Founder of the Grameen Bank, he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world (including the US and Canada) have shown that lending to the poor, helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried. Yunnus\u0027 book is inspiring and an eye-opener. It made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations cannot bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help. It\u0027s hard to separate the book from the idea. One is as fascinating as the other. Out of 5 points, I give it a six\n",
    "\nWhile reading this book I found the details of some cases to be unbelievable.  Also, the \"photographs\" of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings.  I\u0027ve read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim\u0027s hair.  Or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore. And who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent Doberman Pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence? Sure, just let that dog on in. And whose place of employment has a record of all employee\u0027s blood \"groups\" (not their TYPES, just their GROUPS), when the employee doesn\u0027t even know HIMSELF what group he is?\n\nThen I read the introduction, which I always skip, and found out this book is FICTION, not true crime as the cover announced and in which section it was in in the book store.\n\nAs FICTION, it\u0027s okay, (I prefer Agatha Christie), but I don\u0027t believe the forensic work in this book is even based on any fact. So read it for entertainment, but don\u0027t be so gullible as to believe any of it\n",
    "\nI was disappointed in this book--especially after reading the other stellar reviews (which are all, weirdly, from Texas, where the author lives).\n\nWhen it\u0027s a book about logic and clear thinking, a reader expects that book to be free of typographical errors, imprecise logic, and muddled thinking.  Needless to say, I almost put the book down after reading the introduction because of the missing words and typographical errors.  Exampe from page 11:  \"Because the real is out there, we must effectively with it....\"  Here\u0027s another gem from the same page:  \"I am sorry to have to tell you that fact, but that is the way things are.  That is the nature of nature.  That is the reality of reality.\"\n\nLook at page 33.  The author states, \"Why when one exception is uncovered, multiple other exceptions surface almost right away is not entirely clear....  Probably this has something to do with the way we humans view reality.\"  Very disappointing--hasn\u0027t this author studied any cognitive psychology?  It\u0027s called confirmation bias and it\u0027s entirely clear.\n\nOne more example!  On page 60, the author states that Barbara Boxer, a senator from California, \"doesn\u0027t know the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol\" and is \"unlikely to shed intelligent light on the relative safety of either gun.\"  Ouch.  How does he know what Barbara Boxer knows or doesn\u0027t know?  She\u0027s actually very well-versed on the difference between the two; has he heard her speak on the subject?  It comes across as more of an ad hominem attack than anything.\n\nAnyway, save your money on this book and instead buy Jamie Whyte\u0027s CRIMES AGAINST LOGIC.  Now that\u0027s a well-written book!\n",
    "\nHe gave it all he had, but there just wasn\u0027t much of interest there.  He\u0027s a self-described, turmoiled loser, and not very interesting one to boot.  Kafka, Roth, and Jeremy Leven (Satan, et al), write about similar troubled Jews, and are much funnier and interesting. I like his honesty, but, it\u0027s not worth the price of admission\n",
    "\nThe Paleo Diet is based on an interesting premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment. It seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat. Animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time, because their decisions are instinctual. Self-awareness creates a problem that doesn\u0027t exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans. Sometimes we do things out of curiosity, or laziness, or false beliefs. So, considering the erratic behavior of present-day humans, who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs? Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error, frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild.\n\nThe fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact. Rather, eat more wild-sourced food. Just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food, unless the environment from which it comes is polluted- and that is a very real problem. \n\nMeat is a very dodgy thing nowadays, not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era. The Paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world. Now, we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh, and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals. Beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion, as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy. This is no longer true. The average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal, fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme. Basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous. You must choose your meat sources carefully. Meat made from free-range animals raised on pesticide-free in a caring manner can be very hard to find. \n\nI found Loren\u0027s rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded, and in some cases irresponsible. There is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation, and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture: high fructose corn syrup, trans-fatty acids, artifical sweeteners, uncleaned foods raised non-organically with pesticides and herbicides, and improperly raised food animals. \n\nMy main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages (about half) of the book is dedicated to the spiel- convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time. I think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose. After a while you get the feeling Loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you, and it really interferes with the flow of the book.\n\nFurther, a lot (but not all) of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet. The claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine, and peppered throughout the book. But it\u0027s hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited.\n\nOne last nitpick. One great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices. something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world. It\u0027s a pity the recipes included do not explore those, but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead. Espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet, and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining. I found the recipes far too traditional and western-centric. \n",
    "\nIf you want a biased and misleading account of the Arab war against Israel, this ought to satisfy you.\n\nShlaim tells us that Jabotinsky, in discussing Zionism explained that \"if the cause is just, justice must triumph.\"\n\nI think Jabotinsky made a very good point here.  You see, human beings will, if given the chance, tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in.  The ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land.  If injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it (which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it), then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here.  In particular, it would mean a prosperous Israel and a triumph for Zionism.\n\nShlaim appears to have missed all this.  To him, Zionism is unjust.  And to him, the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable.  He tells us that a new independent Levantine Arab state \"is inevitable.\"  I disagree.  It may be likely.  But it would serve no purpose.  It would not help Jews, Arabs, or others.  Its only purpose would be to damage Israel.  The people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language, religion, culture, cuisine, or foreign policy.  So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here.\n\nShlaim also tells us that this new Arab state will be \"weak, demilitarized, and territorially divided.\"  Is it just possible that this, if true, provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all?   And could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable?  Or at least less desirable?  \n\nAnd the author also explains that both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict will have to make \"painful compromises,\" and that Jerusalem will have to be \"the subject of hard bargaining.\" \n\nReally?\n\nIs having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise?  For either side?  Of course not.  Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war, poverty, and destruction are somehow less painful.\n\nHad Shlaim been writing about France and Germany, we\u0027d have seen at once that the whole viewpoint is nonsense.  He\u0027d have been telling us that the German National Socialists needed an independent state in France, either to replace all of France or part of it.  He would have laughingly dismissed French claims on the basis of the entire idea of France being unjust!  He\u0027d have sternly explained that a German National Socialist state in France was both desirable and inevitable.  And he would have discussed the necessary \"painful compromises\" for both sides and the \"hard bargaining\" about Paris.\n\nThere are plenty of reasonable books about the Arab war against Israel.  This isn\u0027t one of them\n",

Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  \"...they hadn\u0027t a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours.\"  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.

As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie\u0027s romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.

    "\nWhen you have lost weight, it\u0027s a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time: \n\n\"What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?\"\n\nMy initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:\n\n\"That\u0027s absolutely crazy! There\u0027s no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method.\"\n\nI did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.\n\nLittle did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It\u0027s called The Carbohydrate Addict\u0027s Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.\n\nThe CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.\n\nIf people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:\n\nBREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.\nLUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.\n\nYou are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.\n\nSound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that\u0027s all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in. \n\nDINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your \"reward\" meal.\n\nHow\u0027s that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn\u0027t enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!\n\nWell, I\u0027m still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial \"planned splurge\" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What\u0027s up with that?\n\nWe can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart\u0027s content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.\n\nThinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict\u0027s Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.\n\nThe frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!\n\nThat\u0027s why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.\n\nI still can\u0027t get around the fact that you don\u0027t change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!\n\nThere\u0027s no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that \"reward\" meal at the end of the day!\n\nWanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict\u0027s Test. I scored a 2, which means \"You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted.\" No kidding, ya think?\n\nDr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.\n\n\"While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it\u0027s not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response.\"\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating \"it\u0027s vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate.\"\n\nWhile The Carbohydrate Addict\u0027s Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I\u0027ll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day\n",
    "\nThis book is just plain stupid. If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic. However, it is not healthy. Each of our meals should be balanced. These people are promoting unbalanced eating. The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs! If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out. This diet won\u0027t heal us, it is a fad. If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading \"The Schwarzbein Principle\" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things. It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place. This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy.\n",
    "\nNo wonder John Gardner didn\u0027t write more fiction books.  He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.  \"Creative atrophy\" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.  If there\u0027s ever been a better example of the \"those who can\u0027t do, teach\" argument, I haven\u0027t encountered it.  This is hardly the place a \"Young Writer\" should start.  Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding \"ignoramouses\" such as John Gardner?  John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world\u0027s finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn\u0027t have the luxury of a \"rigorous classical education.\"   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.  It\u0027s interesting to note how Gardner, who \"taught\" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education\n",
    "\nThis was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author\u0027s task management system.

It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation.\n",

    "\nI am by no means an economist, and much less an expert on finance, but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled, unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis.  I\u0027ve seen much subtler discussions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis written for general audiences, enough of them so I can recognize that Lowenstein doesn\u0027t get it; he equates efficient markets with \"the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value,\" and not with \"you can\u0027t reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do.\"  This is a crucial difference, because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water.\n\nThe other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way Lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story, given what his sources are.  Reading between the lines, I just have to wonder if his description of the personality and character of the people he describes as the core folks at LTCM is much too informed by interviews with people who\u0027ve had a falling out with them\n",

    "\n\"The Glorious Cause\" is the sequel to \"Rise to Rebellion,\" and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give \"Rise to Rebellion.\"\n\nThe events recounted in \"Rise to Rebellion\" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. \"The Glorious Cause\" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.\n\nOne element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.\n\nA mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of \"The Glorious Cause\" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I\u0027m done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with \"Rise to Rebellion\" I don\u0027t feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn\u0027t complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between \"Rise to Rebellion\" and \"The Glorious Cause.\n",

    "\n\"The Other Boleyn Girl\" and \"The Queen\u0027s Fool\" are two of the best books I\u0027ve ever read--and I\u0027ve read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. \"The Virgin\u0027s Lover\" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it\u0027s channeled from another source, and times when it\u0027s harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I\u0027m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I\u0027m going back to Trollope\n",

    "\n\nIt was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin\u0027 thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I\u0027ve got a pretty inquisitive mind and I\u0027m open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.\n\nThe doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I\u0027m immediately going to be freakin\u0027 suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, \"Prepare to be dazzled.\"  Well, evidently Ol\u0027 Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won\u0027t even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book\u0027s dust jacket because I don\u0027t want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won\u0027t mention that.)\n\nIf you\u0027re the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver\u0027s home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask \"But how?\" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call \"common sense.\"  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).\n\nI dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that \"drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health.\"  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY\u0027S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.\n\nIn chapter 4, Smug Mug \"proves\" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you\u0027re less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That\u0027s funny, me neither.  There\u0027s so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.\n\nIn dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it\u0027s funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws \"simply don\u0027t bring down crime.\"  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN \u0026 VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)\n\nIn dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn\u0027t notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a \"crude and drastic sort of insurance policy.\"  Not \"immoral.\"  Not \"sinful.\"  But then I didn\u0027t expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.  \n\nAnd even if Levitt and Dubner\u0027s hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I\u0027ll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they\u0027re pulling out all the stops, trying to \"statistically\" convince the masses that they\u0027re safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)\n\nI won\u0027t even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you\u0027re a working mother, you haven\u0027t cheated your child in the least, but if you\u0027re a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are \"unenlightened.\"  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn\u0027t turning the \"child\u0027s brain to mush.\"  (No word on whether or not it\u0027s turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show \"that a child\u0027s character wasn\u0027t much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn\u0027t, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each.\"  (I\u0027ve often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn\u0027t been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)\n\nI\u0027ve given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy\u0027s fight against the \"three Ks.\"  But if you\u0027re smarter than I am, you\u0027ll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that\u0027s just \"common cents.\"\n",
    "\nThe back cover to this book was intriguing, and captured me immediately. The writing, however, was so plodding, so inconsistent, and so non-sequential that it was painful to get through to the end. This is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day.  I can\u0027t believe that this book made it past the editors.  In one paragraph Jon Katz tells how Rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet, and in the next he says that Rose is too young to herd sheep.

    "\nFrom the remarks at this site, people either love this novel or hate it. I hated it. I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about MFA program writing in the last 30 years. The emphasis is entirely on STYLE. Forget story. Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative. Just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere. Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James, some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits (like H.G. Wells\u0027 THE TIME MACHINE). The first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property. It\u0027s brilliantly written. In fact, it\u0027s so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life, his loves, and the region of the country he inhabits. This book has no driving plot. In fact, it\u0027s an arbitrarily chosen conceit: what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy. It\u0027s not James Joyce\u0027s ULYSSES nor is it trying to be, but EVERY thought this man has is in this book. And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person--any perso--should pick up the book. \n\nIndeed, that seems to be the crux. I read this book because it was by Richard Ford, a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere. You must read this book, they said. So I did. And I consider it an extraordinary waste of my time. To be sure, this is a judgment call, but I\u0027m allowed to make it. EVERY reader is allowed to make that call. But I know I\u0027m in the minority in this. This book is supposed to be one of the greatest American novels of the last 25 years. But will it be so in another 25 years? Are novels now only to be interior monologues (which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay \"Modern Fiction\")? \n\nPerhaps our values are changing. Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story. But what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism, wherein the author writes at length, putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we\u0027re supposed to . . . what? Applaud it? \n\nI believe that the authors we\u0027ll remember will be the natural storytellers. I don\u0027t think Richard Ford is one of them. But, man, he sure can write\n",
    "\nThis was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won\u0027t be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King\u0027s story.  \n\nI don\u0027t so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author\u0027s afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn\u0027t King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can\u0027t believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of \"Welcome to Maine!\"  \n",
    "\nI\u0027m an avid reader of history, as well as processing a degree in the subject.  So imagine my surprise when, after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas, I read the erroneous account of the Children\u0027s Crusade of 1212.  I had done research on this topic, so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred.  Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years?  If he had, he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who, when told to turn back by King Philip II, did so.  That ended that crusade.  The other one, led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas, led a group across the Alps into Italy.  Some left for home while others continued on to Rome.  It\u0027s interesting to note that in Rome, many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these \"children\" were either too old or because they were pregnant.  Perhaps until relatively recently, people believed in the Children\u0027s Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles (like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred, rather than relying on more contemporary sources.  Nor did they realize that the latin word \"pueri\" used in the chronicles can have several meanings (such as unmarried men rather than  children). \n\nIn the final analysis, you just can\u0027t rely on books like these to really teach you history.  The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it.  If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel\u0027s own account of the Children\u0027s Crusade on their website, or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History, or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia.  The book gave two pages to this event, and sadly got it completely wrong.\n\nFor this gross oversight, I am compelled to give it one star.  Readers of history, never just believe what you read - verify\n",
    "\nThe \"bottom-line\" on \"Brainless\" is that one has to be \"brainless\" to take time to read Coulter\u0027s writings, and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them.  \n\nYes, it is mildly interesting to learn of Coulter contradictions (eg. bashes the elite, then takes on Harriet Miers - partly because she didn\u0027t go to an elite law school, and \"I believe everything I say,\" vs. \"Most of what I say, I say to amuse myself and amuse my friends.\"  And then there are the infinite number of brainless \"Coulterisms\" and unsupported assertions - eg. \"public schools have more sex scandals per year than Catholic priests - thirty times more,\" \"Liberals lie about the science on stem-cell research because they warm to the idea of destroying human embryos,\" \"I\u0027ve never seen people enjoying their (9/11) husbands\u0027 deaths so much.\"  On the other hand, Maguire really doesn\u0027t have that much to say that IS INTERESTING!\n\nOn the other hand, if you hadn\u0027t figured out already that there is someting seriously wrong with Ann Coulter - this book won\u0027t help.

    "\n...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they\u0027re written on Mandelbrot wouldn\u0027t have to write books like this because he\u0027d be cleaning out everyone else\u0027s wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it\u0027s true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn\u0027t know anything that countless other traders don\u0027t already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.\n\nBut I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot \u0027on tour\u0027 a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as \"my work shows that...\" or \"I demonstrated that...\" even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people\u0027s work he\u0027ll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his \u0027Everest\u0027 of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn\u0027t even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.\n\nOne time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can\u0027t be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!\n\nI think it\u0027s also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it\u0027s not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn\u0027t mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye\n",
    "\nTo cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.\n\nPerhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn\u0027t even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it\u0027s too late.\n\nThe comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters\u0027 actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.\n\nWhatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren\u0027t they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.\n\nThese days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind\n",

    "\nI had to read Jared Diamond\u0027s Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, \"Collapse\" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve been a fan of Heinlein\u0027s SF for just about as long as I\u0027ve been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.\n\nThe fiction is pretty good (although even that isn\u0027t Heinlein\u0027s best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I\u0027d have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.\n\nFor the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it\u0027s never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of \"fascism\" -- and I\u0027m not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.\n\nAnd mind you, it\u0027s not because I disagree with Heinlein\u0027s opinions; it\u0027s because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)\n\nHeinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. \"The Pragmatics of Patriotism\", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I\u0027ve ever seen.\n\nThen, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he\u0027s certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn\u0027t agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn\u0027t find this a very helpful approach.\n\nPerhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren\u0027t very good. Asimov\u0027s reputation as the \"great explainer\" is in no danger here.\n\nThis volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein\u0027s posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I\u0027ll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O\u0027Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.\n\nAnd when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I\u0027ll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer\n",
    "\nI have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I\u0027ve read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.

    "\nIn his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don\u0027t make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process \"domestication\" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.\n\nWhile there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.\n\nAccording to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).\n\nThe implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, \"domesticated\" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I\u0027m sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else\u0027s beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don\u0027t need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.\n  \nOne of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says \"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God.\"  He uses it to epitomize the use of \"word\" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says \"The word was made flesh and dwelt among us\".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather \"Jesus Christ\".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that \"sin begins with rejection of yourself\" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God\u0027s will (James 4:7).  It\u0027s not about self, but about disobeying God\u0027s ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don\u0027t have something nice to say, don\u0027t say it at all.\n\nIn his second agreement, don\u0027t take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy\u0027s behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz \"you are dealing with yourself, not me\" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I\u0027m glad that someone took 9/11 personally.\n \nAccording to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was \"trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage\" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.\n\nAnother agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.\n\nIn his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.  \n\nWhile Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn\u0027t back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can\u0027t completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations.\n",

    "\nThis book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke\u0027s silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on \u0026quot;Ways and Means\u0026quot; in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy\n",

    "\nI am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.  I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don\u0027t see what was great, or even good, about this story.\n\nTwo teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.  They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy\u0027s innocense.  We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.  Alas, it is not to be.  The kids did it, plain and simple.  Why they did it is so stupid.  The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.  The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn\u0027t executed well at all.\n\nThe characters are boring and 2 dimensional.  The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.  I just can\u0027t say enough about how stupid this story is.  There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.  This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last\n",
    "\nBefore purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers\u0027; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author\u0027s writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul\u0027s life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  \n\nIf you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.  \n",
    "\nThe book jacket for \"The Ruins\" offers a can\u0027t-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It\u0027s the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.  \n\nAlmost immediately, you\u0027ll notice that Smith\u0027s writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.  \n\nNext, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it\u0027s difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they\u0027re doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith\u0027s attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters\u0027 actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.  \n\nAnd for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn\u0027t have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.  \n\nAh yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can\u0027t say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that\u0027s how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you\u0027ll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it\u0027s a real eye-roller, as if to say \"I read this many pages for THIS?\".\n\nBy the time the story concludes, it\u0027s more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you\u0027ll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it\u0027s too little too late.  \n\nThis book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people\u0027s reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort. \n",

Jacobs does point out such problems for a particular, rather bizarre  episode, and suggests, not too coherently, that such \u0026quot;scams\u0026quot; are  still prevalent.

    "\nAGELESS BODY is Deepak\u0027s attempt to neutralize the word \"old\" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like \"body, \"mind\" and \"self,\" into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.\n\n\tIf you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: \"The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)\"  Or try to interpret this one: \"The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)\" \n\n\tAt times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over \"intelligent design.\"  He can\u0027t accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.\n\n\tDeepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word \"quantum\" or not doesn\u0027t change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.

The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he\u0027d wwrite a book about it.

    "\nI started reading this book expecting to like it - it\u0027s historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn\u0027t feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book. \n\nFor one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I\u0027ve read other works from the time period she\u0027s supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus. \n\nAlso, I haven\u0027t read her other book so i didn\u0027t enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I\u0027m not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original. \n\nThe first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren\u0027t bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she\u0027d just speed things along at the beginning.\n\nHowever, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks\u0027 characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott\u0027s book. \n\nIn the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott\u0027s book isn\u0027t very interesting, and how \"Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee.\" If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee\u0027s character seem to just be a way to \"stick it\" to Alcott: \"ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now!\n",
    "\nWhile I found the writing style good and the information interesting, the actual diet was unrealistic, too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable. I found myself longing for spices (how bad could pepper really be?) and questioning the validity of their restriction. I couldn\u0027t stand the ground-up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it (or what I imagine that to be).\n\nI\u0027m not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self-control required, you might find this diet doable and rewarding. I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year (she always gains the weight back). The rest of us, while successful for varying degrees of short periods, found the diet unrealistic for any long-term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss, some even picked up worse habits than they began with.\n\nThe funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting, but I got rid of the book b/c sitting on my shelf it reminded  me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get-healthy  plan. \n\nI\u0027m writing this review so that others don\u0027t get sucked in by all of the positive reviews hoping for lasting results - 3 of us didn\u0027t have any\n",

    "\nBeing a student of photojournalizm in Moscow, Russia, I looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available. I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author, but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.\n\nI was disappointed by the book \"Photographic Composition\" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:\n\n1. It does not cover all important compositional elements, and those that it covers are not explained in full detail. It does not explain:\n- how elements with the similar shapes, similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other, \n- the reverse perspective effect and its uses,\n- why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why, how it can be used on practice,\n- how to balance \"weight\" of different elements of the photograph, it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example,\n- difference between compositional center and the center of interest, how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other)\n- all signs of perspective, it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound, it still should be marked in any complete work, especially when the author covers other three elements)\n- and much much more.\n\n2. It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic, neither does it show how composition works in art, which I believe is very important.\n\n3. Most examples are in color, while most ideas on composition are best explained using B\u0026W photographs.\n\n4. Last but not least, composition is about meaning, making a message, not just how to balance different elements within a frame. The book makes this statement, but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples, while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good.\n\nOVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained \"how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take\". This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading.\n\nI\u0027d be very grateful if you could recommend me (and other folks that look at our reviews) a more thorough book on composition, I\u0027m sure there must be a good book in english on that subject. Thanks!\n\nP.S. For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin \"Fotografiya kak..\", which compared to the book by Tom Grill explains composition in full\n",

    "\nA friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me, as well.  I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions.  If I could actually use the information to help myself, all the better.

    "\nThis is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.  The author\u0027s soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman\u0027s darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally, the characters\u0027 motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen King\u0027s work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  It\u0027s evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad\u0027s intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author\u0027s work again.  It\u0027s a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn\u0027t completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.  His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.  But it\u0027s unfortunate that the industry rewards \"clever\" works such as Mr. Gaiman\u0027s with undue praise.  I\u0027ve never so strongly disliked a book.  Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?  Well, don\u0027t believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you\n",
    "\nIf Julia Glass had not set the bar so high with Three Junes, I would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2.  There are sentences, paragraphs, even pages of brilliance in this book, but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing, and character development in particular.  She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around.  As another reviewer wrote, the writing process seemed transparant.  Reading the book, you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers, or New Mexicans, or black chauffeurs, or Hispanic nannies, or even gay people to be like.  She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them.  The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures.  Greenie might be the most believable, and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan, I wasn\u0027t sucked along with her when she falls in love with \"the other Charlie\".  He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over.  With Saga, she manages to develop her most sympathetic character, but Saga\u0027s life is left floating and unresolved at the end.  Even the brief appearance of Fenno, who I loved in Three Junes, lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky.  All and all, a very disappointing second novel.  You have to wonder, since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character, what good is her editor? \n",
    "\nI heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The \"bowel movement\" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book\n",
    "\nWhen I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.  \n\nI understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the \"masses\" to hate\n",

    "\nSimple arithmetic and you know it\u0027s stupid to expect much from a 227 content book that attempts to tell the success stories and forumlas of 55 business leaders. Definitely everyone of them deserves its own biography instead of an average 4.13 pages. So I had lowered my standard before I read it. Still I had been quite disappointed. All passages were columns published previously on IBD written by different reporters that not only the writing style but the focus on individual leaders fluctuated much between hard data/history and success formula, primarly on the former. I am sorry that I could gain little knowledge/insight (that I really wanted to learn \"how\" they succeeded) during the reading. I felt even worse after reading from the previous reviewer that the content had been available on the net. In short, please give this book a pass!\n",
    "\n\"The Most Anticipated Book in the History of Poker!\" exclaims a blurb on the cover.  Well, if so, I can tell you that a lot of people have been, or are going to be, VERY disappointed.  Comparing the classic Super/System from 1978 with this book is, to paraphrase Mark Twain, like comparing lightning to the lightning bug.\n\nThis book is more of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is \"A Course in Power Poker.\"  Johnny Chan writes a fairly vacuous Preface in which he lauds Brunson, but doesn\u0027t say anything about how to play.  Then we have Brunson\u0027s Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the first Super/System.  Next there is an autobiographical sketch by Brunson entitled, \"My Story.\"  (If you want a book that gives the real flavor of Brunson\u0027s \"story,\" get a copy of According to Doyle (1984).  It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his early days and life on the road.)\n\nFollowing \"My Story\" is a short history of Texas Hold\u0027em by Crandell Addington which isn\u0027t much, and then there is the first chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker.  This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books.  However the tips are hardly \"exclusive\" for SuperSystem2 as claimed.  Beginning with Caro\u0027s cute but now very familiar, \"In the beginning, everything was even money,\" most or all of the tips have been recycled.  For example, Tip #18, page 146, \"WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU...don\u0027t bluff\" is just about the same as Tip #10 \"Seldom bluff if frequent bluffers have checked into you\" found on page 137 in Caro\u0027s Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker (1996).  In fact Caro even recycles his \"exclusive\" tips in this very book.  Tip #31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY...are almost always more dangerous than players staring at you,\" while Tip #40 says in part that \"OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE: ...(3) staring away.\"\n\nJennifer Harman\u0027s chapter on limit hold\u0027em is so ordinary that it\u0027s remedial.  There\u0027s not even a hint of anything new.  There are a number of books on the market that cover the same ground much more thoroughly.  I especially recommend Small Stakes Hold\u0027em: Winning Big with Expert Play (2004) by Ed Miller, David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth or anything by Sklansky.  Also her insistence on referring to hands backwards, \"6-7\" (e.g., on p. 252) instead of \"76\" is annoying and contrary to a well-established convention.\n\nAnd the caricatures by Russ Braun!  They are so bland and flattering that each may have passed prior inspection by the subject\u0027s mother.  Comparing these to the witty and sharp work by Stan Hunt in the original is like comparing a cliche to something alive and vital.  Brunson doesn\u0027t even look like himself.  Here he\u0027s just a generic, smiling, dough boy kind of guy--except in the small, clever, lifelike drawing gracing page 7 which WAS drawn by Stan Hunt, copied from the first book.\n\nGood are the chapters on Omaha and Stud Eight-or-Better.  However, although Brunson has Bobby Baldwin billed as his author of the Omaha Eight-or-Better chapter, actually it was written (as acknowledged) by Mark Gregorich.  He does a good job of introducing the game and giving some of the strategies, and I\u0027m sure he is a fine player, but what about Bobby Baldwin?  Well, as CEO of Mirage Corporation and President of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, Bobby is far, far too busy to write the chapter himself.  So he just lent his name and his supervision.  Can you spell R-I-P-O-F-F?\n\nPerhaps the most embarrassing part of the book is Doyle\u0027s chapter on no limit hold\u0027em.  It is little more than a reprise of the same chapter in the first book published 28 years ago.\n\nAlso recycled is the section on \"Colorful Names of Various Hold\u0027em Hands\" on pages 628 and 629.  The dated references to Raquel Welch (\"38\") and Broderick Crawford (\"10-4\") seem more than a little out of touch.  Indeed, this book is nostalgic tribute to Brunson and the great success he and the original book achieved.  And that is a shame, because this book is billed as an exciting event in the history of the publication of books on poker when in fact it is something hastily put together to flatter Brunson and, hopefully, the pocketbook of those involved.\n\nOne final thing: there is a Glossary, suitable for beginners, which is okay as it defines such things a \"Deuce,\" \"Flush,\" \"Four of a Kind,\" etc., but seems a little basic for \"A Course in Power Poker.\"  Worse though is this definition of a \"Cold Deck\": \"A term often used to describe the deck by players who feel they\u0027re not getting enough playable or winning hands.\"  Players may indeed remark that \"the deck is cold,\" but the origin of the term comes from the fact that a stacked deck used by cheaters that is switched into the game tends to be \"cold\" to the touch since it has not been handled since it was stacked.\n\nBottom line: pass\n",

    "\nSomeone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be. \n\nI am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn\u0027t like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn\u0027t like my negative review. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.\n\nOK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn\u0027t like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I\u0027m not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time. \n\nI thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I\u0027ve read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don\u0027t like. I will not be buying any more of his books\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn\u0027t wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book. \nI cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn\u0027t lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck\n",
    "\nI\u0027d heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I\u0027d take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book.\nJames Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable \"slips\" and \"enabling\" and \"denial\" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man\u0027s \"memoir\" and expect it to offer anything of value? It\u0027s poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn\u0027t exposed him, the writing takes the tone of \"whoppers\" like Frey\u0027s account of the drug house visit in which he \"rescues\" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can\u0027t improve on that.\nSuffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result.\nI was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I\u0027m not laughing.\n",

    "\nOf the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.\n\nIt\u0027s not a bad story at all but it\u0027s just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be. \n\nIt also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.\n\nThe other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like \"wonderful\" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70\u0027s. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.\n\nThis isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable\n",

Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy\n",

But these sections become less and less frequent as the book continues, and it all seems to devolve.\n\nBut pertaining to the audiobook:  What is with the music they insist on playing in the \"background\" at the end of sections?  The first time it came on, I took out my earphones to see if someone in my office was inexplicably blaring piano solos.  It\u0027s weird and invasive and distracts from the reading\n",

The part I found the most interesting was when there would \nbe conversation between Elisha and his friends, especially when they talked about their pasts, which was one of my favorite parts of the book, it was\ninteresting because there was more action happening when they when explaining their past.  \n \n     Although I found this book boring for the most part it was very descriptive and therefore I would recommend it to anyone who likes very descriptive books.\n",
    "\nI really liked Suzanne Summers. I\u0027ve read all her other books and have her tai chi exercise video.

Suzanne has an entire chapter dedicated to someone named Wendy who after 10 years of being a vegetarian was convinced to start eating meat again! Just because Wendy\u0027s particular diet was unhealthy, that doesn\u0027t mean that all vegetarians are unhealthy. There are meat eaters that have unhealthy diets. Look at all the Hindus in India, they\u0027re lifetime vegetarians and are healthy. \n\nI know that soy has been a controversial subject recently, but it\u0027s the pill form of soy that is questionable, soy it it\u0027s natural form is healthy for you. How can you say that soy is bad for you when millions of East Asians eat soy as part of their daily diet? I\u0027ve read countless books and research that supports the benefits of soy.\n\nI eat a balanced vegetarian diet and get all the nutrients my body needs.  Just because one doctor doesn\u0027t believe that a vegetarian diet is healthy, doesn\u0027t make it a fact. Suzanne you\u0027ve really gone too far to tell everyone to stop being a vegetarian.

    "\nI had to read Jared Diamond\u0027s Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, \"Collapse\" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK\n",

    "\nWhile I enjoy adventure stories for the casual reading they are and have read all of Cussler\u0027s, I was disturbed by a lot of the assumptions in this and other of his recent books.  This is transparently hawkish; an ultra-conservative defense of the questionable actions of the very furthest right of the political spectrum.  (One could even suspect it was commissioned or at least underwritten by these elements.)  It reflects the current culture that decrees all means justify the end - as long it benefits the right people.  Cussler\u0027s recent books portray that it\u0027s OKAY for Americans to go into other countries - with which we are not at war - and kill its citizens for some secret government agenda.  That it\u0027s OKAY for our US government to hire out \"black ops\" in secret because it\u0027s against our laws to do so openly.  Through the years, I\u0027ve tolerated Cussler\u0027s blatant sexism, juvenile writing style, improbable exploits of cartoonish heroes.  However, he has veered into political territory that offends me but even more, terrifies me that it may be the truest part of his stories\n",
    "\nUsing this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader\u0027s PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author\u0027s PhotoShop.

Furthermore, this author doesn\u0027t start at a \"dummies\" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along.

    "\nHorribly disappointing.\n\nThese manufactured dialogues are evidently Stephen Law\u0027s way of dealing with his personal problems with religion.\n\nFor example, in one chapter Law manipulates his \"teaching\" by having God contradict the Bible (the assumption being God\u0027s the author) in a dialogue with a conservative religious person. Law even sarcastically concludes the chapter by saying this dialogue is only a dream, the real God would probably respond differently.\n\nGood idea for a book, ruined by the authors distorted logic.

    "\nMy mother in-law was actually responsible for Billy Milligan while he was in the Athens State hospital in Ohio.  I\u0027ve had a chance to read this book, and although very good, what my mother-in-law tells me is much, much different. \n\nShe cared for him during his entire stay there.  She said that he had more psychology and parapsychology books in his room than she could have ever imagined.  She also said that his IQ was off the charts.  She believes (and she has a doctorate in psychology) he only has FOUR distinct personalities.  Raven being one of them.  Billy had the abilitiy and knowledge to manipulate his condition, making it appear much more severe. \n\nOf course, she can\u0027t write anything about this, because Billy\u0027s publicist made everyone caring for him sign a waiver saying they wouldn\u0027t.  Yes... Billy Milligan has a publicist. \n\nHe also was a millionaire (because he exploited his disease) and drove a corvette on the weekends they let him go home.... yep... they let Billy Milligan have weekends.\n\nThis book is a very good interpretaion on what could possibly been going on in Billy\u0027s head.

    "\nA very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a \"New York Times Best Seller List\" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.\n\nThis book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson \"Shot heard around the world\" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking \"I really don\u0027t care bout this stuff\" - I don\u0027t care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover\u0027s bathroom habits, Klara Sax\u0027s artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don\u0027t have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.\n\nI read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50\u0027s (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business. \n\nThe \"masterful\" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo\u0027s ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult. \n\nWas this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50\u0027s-60\u0027s-70\u0027s-80\u0027s were just years of fear, and the 90\u0027s are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don\u0027t think any of these themes came across well.\n\nPlease - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the \"The Corrections\" by Franzen or \"The Cold Six Thousand\" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.\n\nRead the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.\n\n",
    "\nDr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures.

    "\nI usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I\u0027ve read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what \"Insomnia\" is. This isn\u0027t a spoiler, just the author\u0027s note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.\n\nThe other King books I\u0027ve read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  \"Insomnia\u0027s\" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn\u0027t come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn\u0027t usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph\u0027s numerous confidantes.\n\nThen there\u0027s the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.  \n\nI gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer\u0027s arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, \u0027How is King going to get through this?\u0027 His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert\u0027s narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.\n\nOne last thing, the villians just don\u0027t work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there\u0027s the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.              \n",

It looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information.\n\nOne problem I found is that many of the example photos seem to be inserted only to increase the photo count.  Also, because of printing limitations, I find it very difficult to see the differences between before and after examples.\n\nI have edited this review to fix an error.

    "\nThis novel is set in the 40\u0027s, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two. The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed. The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him.  Neither one is likable, the 40\u0027s cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring.  However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.\n\nIf old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I\u0027m sure you could find better.  Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior\n",

    "\n   At the height of socialist popularism in England, cir. 1944,  George Orwell, a leading proponent of socialism, believing in its promises as did many,if not most of Eurpose\u0027s leading intellectuals and politicians, wrote a review of Hayek\u0027s famous book, \"The Road to Serfdom.\"  Orwell wrote the review in the \"Observer,\" London April 9,1944.\n   Hayek, mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book, \"The Constitution of Liberty\" published in 1960, as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals, when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book, \"Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion\" (1940).  Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism, but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to \"The Road to Serfdom.\"  By 1960, when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak, Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal, were now introducing the concept of the welfare state.  \n    While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwell\u0027s works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother, how many of us are aware of Hayek\u0027s infulence on him?  \n    \"The Constitution of Liberty\" provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge, of which this one footnote is only a small example.  Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them, and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about \"liberty\" which requires the \"rule of Law\" to exist in today\u0027s society, but that Rule of Law must be understood.  The failure of today\u0027s inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations.  \n    Unfortunately, Hayek is no longer alive to help guide us through the new millenium.  Fortunately, he has left us a large volume of work, perhaps more relevant today than it was when written years ago.  While \"The Constitution of Liberty\" is voluminous in itself, it should be kept as a reference book.  Hayek\u0027s other works, \"The Road to Serfdom\" and his last published volume, \"Fatal Conceit-the Evils of Socialism\" published in 1980 is a magnificent continuation of Hayek\u0027s life long discertation on the evolution of mankind\u0027s growth from a tribal, familial society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty, to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens, but only moderately understood, so that such a great and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell. \n  Hayek\u0027s understanding that Western Civilization has prospered from individualism, that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel, to trade, to exchnge property, material, real and intellectual.  He explains why man must be humble, that humans progress from trial and error, not from conceited belief that one way or another way is correct.  That to be free and liberated is to be free to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals\u0027rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their own ideals and beliefs.   \n \n",

    "\nI heard about this book growing up but didn\u0027t read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that\u0027s why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today\u0027s standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the \"female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book\u0027s message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man\u0027s part...\" Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford\u0027s situation, and Lady Chatterley\u0027s, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn\u0027t have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick.\n",

I didn\u0027t like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I don\u0027t think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a \"Do Right Man\" at all, but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow.

By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women\u0027s Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it\u0027s been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it\u0027s even badly written.

    "\nI bought this off of the New York Public Library website.  What an utter waste of $40.  The book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful, but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while.  The worst part is the \"software\" that you are supposed to use to catalog your books.  First of all, it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QA\u0027d would be released in such condition.  Second of all, the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet.  I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software.  You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book.  There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data.  I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores.  It is a major, major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.\n\nThe product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/).  Readerware, for the same amount of money ($40), allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner.  Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered, (using the Internet),  and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book. I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours.  BTW, you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs, (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books, DVDs, and CDs).\n\nOf course, you don\u0027t have to take my recommendation to buy \"Readerware\", but please don\u0027t waste your money on \"Your Home Library.\n",

    "\nMaybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely\n",

    "\nThe Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation.

    "\nI purchased this book to gain a better insight about Aspergers.  Instead, it left me with many unanswered questions.  The book is the equivalent to a boring, monotonous `Dear Diary\u0027 that gets stuck in one era: His college years and his interest in music.  (This is understandable as the author is terrified of life outside of college, \u0026 music is all he knows.)  Yet I craved more details, I wanted to know more about Mr. Shores\u0027 childhood, his parents, the stims, and the chaos...DETAILS!\n\nIt felt as if the author was trying to prove how intelligent he is, boasting of his accomplishments and how he\u0027s almost neurotypical.  His failures were blamed on other people out to get him for unknown reasons.  Lets say it for what it is: A man who looks kind of disheveled and a bit `odd\u0027 (Unabomber) gets a job in a financial institution, he rides his bike in, hangs out in the shadows getting dressed, doesn\u0027t socialize - and no one wants him around.  It\u0027s BECAUSE HE\u0027S WEIRD!  Yet the author blames his co-workers.\n\nI\u0027m sorry but the reality is, the author probably can\u0027t see and understand that he IS different because he has Aspergers!   I mean, most typical people can spot someone that is odd/weird/different a mile away.  They avoid them not because they\u0027re being hurtful, they just can\u0027t relate to that person. \n\nI wished he had focused in much greater detail about his feelings, emotions and behaviors when he was younger-to gain a better understanding of what shaped him into the person he is now.  The book was written as if he fast-forwarded through his entire youth and got stuck on `pause\u0027 when he got to college.  While this is obsessively interesting to him, it was tiring reading page after page of redundant accounts of his college days.\n \nThere is no depth to the book, it was shallowly written and there is not enough elaboration to make me understand, (or want to for that part) what makes Stephen Shore the person he is.  While this may be due in part to his disorder, it left so much to be desired. \n\nI\u0027m sorry to anyone who takes offense to this review, as this is not my intention.  I applaud Mr. Shores accomplishments and the hurtles he\u0027s overcome.  He must be MUCH more dimensional than the book conveys.   I wanted to know more about HIM and not what he\u0027s done in his life.\n\nI\u0027d suggest a better read would be one of Temple Grandin\u0027s books.  I got a true feeling of who she is and an understanding of how she got there and how autism fits in.  She goes into details about what she was thinking as a girl, teenager and adult.  Her pranks, her temper, the metaphors and their importance..everything.\n\nI bought this book based on reviews, and I felt it necessary to give mine.\n",

    "\n   I originally bought this title when it came out as a four-part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection. \n   Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds (what if) story set approximately ten years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every other super hero. As the story unfolds, the reason Superman quit is revealed. A rival hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder. When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted, Superman quit in disgust. The results of the public choosing a hero that would kill are very apparent in the future. \n   The children of the super heroes we know are everywhere. They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each other in the way they see fit, destroying property and causing chaos. Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his self-imposed exile in the nuclear wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the former heroes in returning order. \n   When Superman returns to the public eye in issue #2, it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible, but with Superheroes being the catalyst. The new Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle(The world\u0027s greatest escape artist) called the Gulag. All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray, a disillusioned pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman. He is led on his journey by the Spectre (DC\u0027s Angel of Death)\n   I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid, the way he wraps comic characters and events into a Biblical epic is brilliant. The painted art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in it\u0027s realism. The re-imagined characters are god-like in their depiction, especially the Flash- a red blur wrapped in lightning wearing a winged Greek helmet.\n   Issue #3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag. As Superman races to the scene, he is thrown to the ground by the only person that could, Captain Marvel. I still remember waiting for issue #4 to come out. \n   The fight scene between Captain Marvel and Superman was voted #1 all-time by Wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone. Even  without this fight scene, I would rate this as one of the ten greatest mini-series ever, but with it Kingdom Come is #1.\n  The only possible negative to this series is that you have to already know something about comics to fully appreciate all the subtleties Waid and Ross weave into this story. Nearly every DC character is pictured at least once.(A geek\u0027s paradise I guess) After reading this I actually liked Captain Marvel, who I had always seen as an even cheesier version of Superman. The fear the other heroes have of him and his power level make him hard to laugh at, despite Jerry Ordway\u0027s Power of Shazam monthly series to the contrary.\n  I hope my description of the story has led any undecided mind to pick this up. Fabulous art and incredible writing. (This should be 5 stars, but I can\u0027t seem to edit my rating\n",

His anti-alcohol tirades would make any Prohibition era preacher proud.\n\nBurke has fallen into a trap of using the same imagery and phrasing again and again, and it makes the reader wonder if he isn\u0027t cutting and pasting entire paragraphs repeatedly.  If I read one more time in a Burke book that Leadbelly strung his twelve stringed guitar in octaves, I will be sick (hey, Mr. Burke?  Twelve stringed guitars have always been strung that way, Leadbelly didn\u0027t invent that tuning, okay?)  If I read the word \"phallus\" in a sex scene in one of Burke\u0027s books one more time, I think I will just give up.  The phrases are getting old - really old.  The preaching about political corruption and alcohol got old many books ago.\n\nOne thing to be thankful about in this abysmal wreckage of what was once a great series - Bootsie, Dave Robicheaux\u0027s wife, is dead, though that doesn\u0027t keep her out of the story.  But at least the reader is spared another element that has been repeated to death - the moment in every book with Bootsie in it where she gets up in the night, angry with Dave, and goes to sleep on the couch.  I\u0027ve had bets with other readers as to what page Bootsie will do this inevitable stunt (which then opens up the opportunity for another sex scene with the \"phallus\" when they kiss and make up) in each Burke novel where she is a character.  Thankfully, also, Alafair, Dave\u0027s adopted daughter, is far away at college, and we are spared her teenaged brattiness which became tedious in the earlier books and yet another repetition of the story of how Dave came to adopt her, which is included in every book since the introduction of the Alafair character.\n\nIt\u0027s time for Mr. Burke to let the series go.  It\u0027s a travesty of its former self.  Reading this book is like visiting a relative who has lost their mind to dementia - you see a hollow, nearly unrecognizable shell of a formerly vital and beloved person.  It\u0027s painful\n",
    "\nI am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can\u0027t stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...\n\nLast night, I\u0027m reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn\u0027t work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn\u0027t work try being nice. I don\u0027t know many smokers but I don\u0027t know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won\u0027t see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me.\nEven the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife.\n",
    "\nDr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of \"doing his job\" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.\n\nI find Jose Saramago\u0027s \"Blindess\" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.\n\nI found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book\n",

It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don\u0027t fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn\u0027t odd because Robert is a professional liar\n",

    "\nI have very mixed feelings about this book and can\u0027t say I enjoyed it all that much. I love the story of Sappho, what little is known of it, and so I picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism, research, and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of Lesbos. But monsters? Centaurs? I mean, the story of Sappho\u0027s life is not the story of The Odyssey and for the life of me I don\u0027t understand why  author Erica Jong decided to give her readers a combination of Greek heroine and Clash of the Titans. \n\nOnce I was able to get past the fantasy elements, I realized that I was not being pulled into the story on its own merits. There wasn\u0027t enough emotional dimension -- for all her travels, we\u0027re shown pretty landscapes and scary oceans but we don\u0027t see enough of a real character. I read Sappho\u0027s poems in college and the talented mind behind those words is NOT present in this book. \n\nI\u0027m not saying the book is without its good points. Jong has certainly done a lot of research and her enthusiasm is many times contagious. But I found the whole bit a little odd... like picking up a book about Cleopatra and seeing her encounter dragons, unicorns, and the goddess Isis. If Jong had written about Ariadne, this all might have worked. The blend of fantasy just didn\u0027t add up to a palatable meal for me\n",
    "\nI usually enjoy Ms. Maron\u0027s Deborah Knott books very much. The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. The first murder doesn\u0027t seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just \"there\". The second one involving Dwight\u0027s son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting. \n\nI devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts. Glad I checked it out from the library and didn\u0027t purchase it outright..do the same and don\u0027t waste your money\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman\u0027s other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up. \n",

    "\nThe sub-header to this book could very well be: \"All Work \u0026 no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy\". \n\nBasically, Tom Stanley\u0027s scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion: \n\nMillionaires, you see: \n\n1) Save more than they spend; \n\n2) Don\u0027t spend anything. \n\nThat\u0027s it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don\u0027t spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane. \n\nTo wit: if you\u0027re a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting \u0026 the Fine Arts, you\u0027ll die loaded!Sound like fun? \n\nDidn\u0027t think so. Look: you\u0027ve got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you\u0027re looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large. \n\nIt\u0027s true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.\n\nBut there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices. \n\nThe guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he\u0027s also a loser. \n\nThis is a guy who didn\u0027t want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there\u0027s a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire\u0027?\n\nI think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don\u0027t need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you\u0027re good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow. \n\nBut for the Love of God, it\u0027s only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself? \n\nSure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom. \n\n\"Millionaire Next Door\" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley\u0027s thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it\u0027s off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you\u0027ve got it, flaunt it. \n\n\"Millionaire Next Door\" isn\u0027t a bad book: it\u0027s scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints. \n\nBut as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I\u0027ll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again? \n\nJS\n",

That is perfectly justified!\n\nThe book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come \"Hickman\" is not a \"Christian\" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don\u0027t find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs\n",
    "\nI\u0027ll put my opinion first, so there won\u0027t be any doubt in your mind.  I don\u0027t believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as \u0026quot;national character\u0026quot;? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man\u0027s views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the \u0026quot;inside view\u0026quot;--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy\u0027s long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian \u0026quot;character\u0026quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you\n",
    "\nI agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it\u0027s impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn\u0027t change, he\u0027s unsympathetic, and by the time we\u0027ve reached page 500, we don\u0027t know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.\n\nAnother major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.\n\nOverall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time\n",

    "\nLike most great diplomatic moments, successes and failures alike, decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the Camp David debacle can appear.  Even then, disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after.  Given the wide interest in the Israeli-Arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations, new works exploring the crucial climax at Camp David remain welcome.  Some dismiss Mr. Swisher\u0027s work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team, but instead was responsible at Camp David only for negotiations.  That seems to me unfair.  Clayton Swisher clearly did considerable \"leg work\" to prepare this text; sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect.\n\nMr. Swisher\u0027s book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross\u0027s interesting \"The Missing Peace\" and, given Mr. Ross\u0027s direct involvement in the negotiations; no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well.  However, Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross\u0027s feet, even when he makes claims that others at Camp David, many more central then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements.  Much for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross\u0027s change of \"municipal Jerusalem\" to \"greater Jerusalem\" in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement.  Unfortunately, Ross\u0027s change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by Robert Malley, a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the Palestinian point of view, who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties.  Malley has never denied this.  Moreover, days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down.\n\nSwisher\u0027s target, perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view, shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team.  While such an effort might well be reasonable, Mr. Swisher often twists facts, making excuses for Palestinian gaffs while blowing minor facts out of all proportion.  For example, Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian team insisted that Jews had no historic link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as mere posturing.  However, he never mentions that such ideas, undermining the Jewish people very claim to the Land, serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost impossible.  Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in good faith, treating every Israeli offer simply as a new base line, rather than offering any proposals of their own.  Again, even Robert Malley concedes that this disingenuous strategy by the Palestinians likely doomed Camp David from the start.\n\nSwisher\u0027s dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as silly Israel\u0027s interest and the Palestinian\u0027s refusal of any compromise for the so-called \"right of return,\" or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of modern Israel and all their descendants must have a right immigrate to Israel, a right held by no other people.  As to the simple fact that this would lead to the destruction of the Jewish State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit national suicide, on this problem Mr. Swisher remains silent.\n\nLastly, one cannot help but marvel at Mr. Swisher\u0027s odd coverage of the events after Camp David.  That Yasser Arafat led a bloody war against Israel rather than offering an alternative proposal for peace is dismissed.  Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for, magnifying, and twisting any event that will make Israel look bad, while at the same time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of suicide terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in cold blood.  Mr. Swisher even parrots points of Palestinian propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even Palestinian leaders no longer mention them, such as the claim of massacres during Israeli operations in Jenin, which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing more than a fabrication.  \n\nCuriosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely biased view.  Fortunately, he lays out his rather simplistic point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following, \"The primary reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains unbridled support for Israel\u0027s oppression of the Palestinians.\"  Again, one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his hatred manifests from the presence of American Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic holy lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq.  Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel, but it seems for Mr. Swisher\u0027s simplistic world view, it is at the door step of the Jewish state where all blame is to be laid.  \n",

This old bag of a man gives Muslims free passes and blames America.\n\n \nQuestion:  When will the world start holding to account the actions of Muslims, and stop blaming others, such as Bush, America, the Pope, or God knows who else? How many more innocent people will die at the hand of Muslims before the western world finally, and for the first time, holds the Muslims accountable for their own actions, rather than someone else?  \n\n  Well Im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of Islamofacism.  Im tired of the leftist media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of middle-eastern tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words.  And then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope!  Can you believe it?!!  Yes, idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word.  Its unreal!  A grown man got a gun, deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman\u0027s backside, and deliberately pulled the trigger, purposefully killing her in cold blood....and yet according to socialist America-hating leftists, he couldn\u0027t help it.  Its not his fault...its the Pope\u0027s fault guys!    Respond to words with violence, and then blame the speaker, absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility.  As absurd as that sounds, I\u0027m sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that.  And they are idiots (like Noam)\n",

    "\nI bought this book this weekend as we\u0027re doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don\u0027t much like it. I\u0027ve got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn\u0027t observe personal boundaries of other\u0027s what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her \u0027stalker mom\u0027 mentality. \n\nIn the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child\u0027s boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn\u0027t send a message about love as much as \u0027I own you\u0027. I like \u0027Mama Do You Love Me?\u0027 better for explaining to a child a parent\u0027s unconditional love.\n\n\u0027Good-Night Moon\u0027 by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children\u0027s all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he\u0027s from a fairly \u0027normal\u0027 family.\nTake it w/a grain of salt\n",
    "\nAside from the 1958 Championship Game and the 1968 Super Bowl, the actual football games got very short shrift. The 1964 Championship Game didn\u0027t even get a MENTION! Whole years are virtually ignored. Very, very little discussion of Unitas\u0027 career and his impact on the game: mostly just anecdotes about family, friends, and teammates, and way too much space devoted to post-mortem comments from same. I think I learned way more about Johnny Sample and Gino Marchetti and Jim Parker from this book than I learned about Unitas. And that\u0027s not saying much. There\u0027s a lot of padding in this book but precious little information. And a lot of the anecdotes will be familiar if you\u0027re a football fan. Wait for the paperback if you\u0027re a Unitas devotee; otherwise don\u0027t bother.\n",
    "\nThis is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.  \n\nOn the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes \"literature read like history and history read like literature.\"  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to \"pulsating life.\"  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque\u0027s All Quiet on the Western Front.  \n\nI must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook. \n\nHis narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.  \n\nAfter the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.\n\nShaara doesn\u0027t even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918\u0027s, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective. \n\nAnd, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn\u0027t sell as well.\n\nFor those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall\u0027s work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him\n",
    "\nThis book is an nice collection of differing points of views about latinos/hispanics. However it\u0027s primarily philisophical. It\u0027s more confusing than inspiring. It\u0027s great for those studying for a phD, but will not inspire average latinos to action. This book tilts slightly more towards the assimilationist point of view, although a few writers do express some pan-latino thoughts.\n",
    "\nJ.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I\u0027ll only be getting the 7th one because it\u0027s the last one and I\u0027ve read this far so I might as well go the whole way. \n\nIn books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.\n\nThis book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.\n\nHarry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.\n\nAs to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the \u0027revealations\u0027 in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn\u0027t amount to anything.\n\nMy final opinion: Don\u0027t bother to read past book 4 if you\u0027re just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book\n",
    "\nThe premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache. \n\nI have read one other Case book I think, his \"Kingdome Come\" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I\u0027m not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that \u0027Kingdome Come\u0027 was much better than \u0027First Horseman.\u0027 Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum\n",
    "\nKeynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and \u0027expertise\u0027 on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead\n",

    "\nI read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara\u0027s Pulitzer Prize winning \"Killer Angels,\" and because I\u0027m a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It\u0027s a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn\u0027t quite there.\n\nAny baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.\n\nThis book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in \"Killer Angels.\"  It\u0027s unfortunate.\n\nThere are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author\u0027s other book\n",

    "\nWright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of \"the road to 9/11.\"  Understanding Qutb\u0027s radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss\u0027 followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the \"friend and enemy\" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a \"state of exemption.\"  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, \"The Power of Nightmares\" or \"From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism\" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.

His early books were taken directly from Herbert Sheldon\u0027s Natural Hygience material, which I assume must not have been copyrighted, and I felt ripped off then, in the 70\u0027s as I did recently when Amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books. \n",

DeLong\u0027s denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded.  DeLong\u0027s politics overcome his analysis.

    "\nThis book really irritated me. I loved Mayes\u0027s previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one. The concept, a year of traveling to different locations, seemed like it would be really interesting combined with Mayes\u0027 fresh perspectives, enthusiasm for discovery, feisty opinions and poetic descriptions. But somehow it didn\u0027t work. \n\nI get the sense that her heart wasn\u0027t really in this book. Maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years, and cobbled together? Or because there\u0027s so much `padding\u0027 - endless quotes from her own or other people\u0027s writing. When she liked the place, her descriptions feel artificially enthusiastic, almost as if the book was paid for by the chamber of commerce. I got tired of reading that she could live there, or could imagine taking her grandson there, or wishes she was born there, or that it\u0027s SO much better than San Francisco. Where she doesn\u0027t live anymore, and hasn\u0027t for years. There are also too many stories about refreshing local characters who think Frances Mayes is the nicest, most tasteful, most interesting person they\u0027ve ever met. Especially since these people tend to be waiters, cab drivers, rug salesmen or others whose business depends on charming the tourists. \n\nMost of the book consists of sneering at her fellow Americans, or talking about people\u0027s personal appearance. This is boring and clich�d - and if you like that kind of thing, Bill Bryson does it better. There\u0027s also way too much name dropping (she\u0027s always mentioning \"my friend so-and-so, the famous ____\"). What happened to the ordinary, financially stretched, middle-aged college professor? She seems to be taking on the persona of a celebrity. She doesn\u0027t want to be crowded in with a group, doesn\u0027t want to associate with ordinary tourist types - now she deserves the VIP treatment. This is definitely a change from her previous books.\n\nI think when it comes right down to it, there\u0027s too much Frances Mayes in this book. I thought I liked her, but what I really like is her writing style. It can still be magical - when she gets her ego out of the way. But when she puts herself front and center, she becomes more tedious and pretentious than interesting. Now I\u0027m sorry I read this book, because I\u0027m afraid it will spoil my enjoyment of the earlier ones.\n",

    "\nMost books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page. The books of Richard Dawkins, whom Rose selects as his special target, illustrate this well: readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain. How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts? Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in Rose\u0027s book. There is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists\u0027 opinions, but almost no observations from behavioural biology. Nonetheless, in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists \"who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments\", dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as \"people who either no longer do science or never did it.\" What a pity, therefore, that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book. There are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave, and that\u0027s about it. \n",

Without those details, the book seemed \"unfinished\".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.

    "\nI\u0027ll put my opinion first, so there won\u0027t be any doubt in your mind.  I don\u0027t believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as \u0026quot;national character\u0026quot;? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man\u0027s views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the \u0026quot;inside view\u0026quot;--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy\u0027s long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian \u0026quot;character\u0026quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you\n",
    "\nIt has the potential to be a great book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed. The \"Canadian Eskimo Dog\" is now referred to as the Canadian Inuit Dog out of respect for the Inuit people. He has the dog\u0027s height wrong, and the weight range is much too high. This leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed, who\u0027s to say that it\u0027s not wrong on other breeds too? \nI was quite disgusted and mad to see the \"designer dogs\" put as purebred dogs. Labradoodles, Bichon/Yorkies, Cockerpoos, and Bull Boxers are NOT purebred dogs. They are mixes given a fancy name and sold for staggering amounts of money. \nThe first few chapters on the history of the dog is quite fascinating though, and the pictures are nice. If you need an all-in-one book and don\u0027t mind many errors, this is a great book for you.

I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master\u0027s care of their puppy and mature dog.  Problems handlers encounter in \"greeting\" of your dog with other dogs and people. \n\nSecondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.

    "\nI\u0027ve read only a few of Hillerman\u0027s previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I\u0027ve enjoyed what I\u0027ve rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don\u0027t indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his \u0027 semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee\u0027 phase. \n\nFrom what I gather, \u0027Skeleton Man\u0027 continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman\u0027s last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment.\n\u0027Skeleton Man\u0027 starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to \u0027real life\u0027(See Nelson De Mille\u0027s \u0027Night Fall\u0027), Hillerman fails here.\nThe story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called \u0027action\u0027.\nChee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story.\nThe spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman\u0027s earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee\u0027s wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived \u0027Superman rescues Lois\u0027 situations. \nBetter to stick with Hillerman\u0027s earlier novels.

    "\nI will be brief: Penroses writing is mediocre, his drawings obfuscate more than clarify.\nThe vast majority of the book is devoted to completely and utterly extraneous topics, and seems to largely be a platform for Penroses new quantum theories.\nHis arguments are unclear, weak and largely dependent on philosphers like Lucas and Searle, while his idea of quantum effects is improbable and surely in the end irrelevant (cannot computers tap into quantum effects?) and his knowledge of computer science deeply, deeply suspect.\nFor example, I quote here from the final sections which actually have something to do with his ostensible reason for writing the book: \n\"Neverthless, one still might imagine some kind of natural selection process being effective for producing approximately valid algorithms. Personally, I find this very hard to believe, however.\"\nThe entire flourishing, commercially succesful field of evolutionary computing begs to differ here, Mr. Penrose.

    "\nMany reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70\u0027s, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.\n\nMost of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn\u0027t have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to \u0027believing\u0027.\n\nFor most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey\u0027s pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.\n\nThis is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.\n\nI love a good horror novel. I love a good \u0027true crime\u0027 thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey\u0027s books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.\n\nThat, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you\u0027ll find in the bible or any of Lindeys \u0027books\u0027. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don\u0027t be the next sucker. Please don\u0027t add this one to your cart.\n\n",

Unfortunately, this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).\n\nThe reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there, of similarly detached people, who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.  \n\nIt is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.  New media streams like the internet, blogs, etc. offer up \"news\" without accountability.  They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.  It makes people like Frank Rich, rich, with very little effort.  Why bother checking facts, his core readership doesn\u0027t care whether it is true or not, just tell them Bush is evil\n",

    "\nI wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book\u0027s errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony\u0027s founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world\u0027s great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair.\n\nThen, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan\u0027s seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely \"Japanese\".\n\nThen there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world\u0027s best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of \"second-hand goods\", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world\u0027s worst overpackaging.)\n\nReading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. Japan\u0027s consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. In another example, Morita praises the \"trust\" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. In reality, this \"trust\" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs.\n\nOther than the glimpses into Sony\u0027s history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of \"Japan is going to take over\" books that came out in the Eighties. Although, of course, considering all the \"Internet companies are going to take over\" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely \"Japanese\" phenomenon. \n\nPS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read \"Dogs and Demons\" by Alex Kerr.\n",

    "\nGalbraith\u0027s insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure.  His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery.  In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience.  The book really needs to go back to an editor\n",
    "\nMr. Galbraith is smart, accomplished, and learned man who knows what is best for all us.  His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia.  Rather than a completely coercive state directing the  actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be  `practical\u0027 and just further defines the third way.  Nonetheless, his  proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and  it is more attuned to the European model of society.  Many of his proposals  are so silly you won\u0027t take them seriously.  But sadly, he is quite  serious.  For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone  should have a rewarding life.  Of course, he never defines the standard by  which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding.  Neither  does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what  the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life.   And, of course, who is the `rewarding life judge\u0027 and does this judge have  the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life  that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too  un-rewarding.  Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the  practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between  socialism and capitalism, and saying nothing new\n",
    "\nEven the avid \"trekie\" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying \"Beam me up, Scotty.\"  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide \"Rapture.\"  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer. \n\nThe story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions. \n\nIn the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.  \n\nInstead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham\u0027s biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham\u0027s \"new evangelism\" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the \"Tribulation Force\" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell\u0027s Moral Majority.\n\nThey are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.\n\nThe U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism\u0027s growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.\n\nI see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the \"left behind\" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.\n\nThomas J. Hickey\n\n",

I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young \"sew-your-wild-oats\" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the \"perfect\" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm.

    "\nI was recommended Borges\u0027 works by one of his innumerable over-educated sycophants and I will never forget the tremendous time I wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life\u0027s work (when I should have been writing my dissertation). Each time I read one of his pedantic, mediocre peices of short fiction, I was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that I would like other examples of his work if I continued reading since \u0026quot;all of his stories are so unique.\u0026quot; I found the exact opposite to be true. One story after another about mazes, mirrors, mystical mathematical formulas and books, books, books. The ideas were transperant, the language boring in the extreme. His poetry is trite. Who needs this? Borges reads like a petulant graduate student at University of Chicago who failed repeatedly to get his/her short fiction published in _The Atlantic Monthly_. Particularly among academics, literary elites and like people, many seem to cite Borges and worship his genius more than read him--and certaintly _no one_ reads him critically. I read most of his work, and I can tell you, outside of a few interesting turns of phrase, you\u0027d be better off reading a Yale dissertation on the semiotics of self-superiority. People incessantly talk about how imaginative Borges is. The vast majority of popular SF and fantasy writers are more imaginative. Even many of the despicable magical realist \u0026quot;geniuses\u0026quot; make Borges look rather plain. Borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of Manhattan or Cambridge. If you\u0027re this kind of pompous fellow, you\u0027ll want to sleep every night with a portrait of Luis by your side and a series of mirrors, as it were, slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans-substantiation with this benighted old librarian. If you\u0027re the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters, enjoying nuanced use of language, and grasping subtle, daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter, run far, far away from Jorge Luis Borges. Even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews. The adulation of Borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among (those who think themselves) intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction. I think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment, relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams, and not an example of literary genius. In that sense, 30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work, and that\u0027s about as much attention as he deserves\n",

The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he\u0027d wwrite a book about it.

Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate \"Pefection\" with \"Conformity\" and condemning it as inauthentic.  I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e., wanting to be the perfect mother, perfect daughter, perfect wife, perfect businesswoman); therefore, it creates warm, fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being \"boring\".

He also presents some convincing data (gathered by other people) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on-line world, alienating them from the world of face-to-face interaction; this happens in the case of a few troubled people, but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off-line relationships. The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image, with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology. This is, frankly, ludicrous reductionism. It doesn\u0027t even stand up to a simple test of chronology--a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid-1990s. As Castells himself admits, businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene, and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements. On top of this, Castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked, whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations. I\u0027m really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena. Castells does see some of the problems with the new network society--loss of job security and the digital divide, for instance--but he tends to downplay these. And his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same--more internet access, more network social organization. Talk about a narrow vision\n",
    "\nThis \"novel\" would be better suited for the stage.  It reads like a play, often.\n\nIt\u0027s not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting \"high drama\" within a family.  They suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all.\n\nThere are far too many scenes of shouting, histrionics.  The father goes from being Ward Cleaver to a verbally abusive monster.  If I had to see the mother one more time with her calling \"Robin!\" I was going to scream.\n\nThe author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict.  This author forces the climax onto us in every scene.  He\u0027s desperate for this end result of angst, high drama and shock.\n\nIt\u0027s overkill.  I don\u0027t believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous.  Sure it happens but this was the Leave it to Beaver family at first.  It just doesn\u0027t make sense that because of ONE incident, all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters.\n\nIn short, the author needs to be focused more on telling a story, allowing the reader to infer.  Instead, he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn.  It\u0027s ironic, actually, as he\u0027s trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that I just felt tedium.\n\nVery, very contrived and forced novel.  Not believable.  I do not recommend\n",

    "\nIt still amazes me that anyone takes Gould seriously. He is an admitted Marxist, and he allows his social beliefs to influence science. That is not science. Science is a dispasionate search for the truth. I get the feeling reading this book that Gould doesn\u0027t like what the truth is, so he wants to shape the way we see the truth. They used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun.\n\nGould tries to claim that Samuel George Morton fudged his data on measuring skull sizes. This is not true. Morton conducted his tests with integrity, and only one error was found which actually benefited the measurements of a non-Caucasian group (Kevin McDonald, \"Culture of Critique\", 36). General intelligence is not a \"statistical artifact\" as Gould wants to promote.\n\nGould or any other scientist who wants to take Darwin out of biological sciences should be viewed with extreme skepticism\n",
    "\nJ.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I\u0027ll only be getting the 7th one because it\u0027s the last one and I\u0027ve read this far so I might as well go the whole way. \n\nIn books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.\n\nThis book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.\n\nHarry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.\n\nAs to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the \u0027revealations\u0027 in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn\u0027t amount to anything.\n\nMy final opinion: Don\u0027t bother to read past book 4 if you\u0027re just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book\n",

A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives\u0027 tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number.

Post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. Eisenberg, a former Esquire editor and short-timer with Lands End, ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you need to feel secure? The problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. Constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.\n\nEisenberg doesn\u0027t help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. Doctors, divorcees, `downshifters\u0027, and very little real data shed little light on the real issues. Maybe I knew too much going in. Maybe I expected too much from a few positive references from other sources. In the middle I was confused. By the end I was simply disappointed. And I have my own number, and it changes every day\n",

    "\nThe trouble starts early. There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community. This is an enormous assumption about the general public\u0027s knowledge - both of video games and more-so it\u0027s history of design. Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment.\n\nEven though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the \u0027new-time\u0027 classics? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable. The brief smattering of \u0027classics\u0027 that are shown tend to be more human-looking figurative than \u0027iconic\u0027 which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation.\n\nBeyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather \u0027same-y\u0027 to me. Lots of brooding dark scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal. When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world-famous museums, such as \"Rez,\" -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft(!) in the same spread. One has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?\n\nThe fact of the matter is that for all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now. And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and utterly unique designs being done in FLASH. Arguably one of the largest and least expensive/complicated environments for making a unique game. Furthermore, all the games covered and talked about (that I can tell) are from very large corporations and as such tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards.\n\nMy biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art. Far too many examples if things that look the same versus examples of unique design concepts and forms as well as proper representations for an historical analysis. Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and some interesting topics are raised with relation to character conception versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design analysis or critical anything\n",

    "\nThis is the book Dan Brown\u0027s bestseller \"The Da Vinci Code\" is based on. Indeed, Michael Baigent et.al. have even sued Brown in court, charging him with plagiarizing their book. The ideas behind \"The Da Vinci Code\" have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians. Obviously, this exposure affects \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\" as well. \n\nThis book is methodologically flawed. It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene. But if this happened, there should be ancient documents telling us about it. There are essentialy only three ancient views of Jesus: the Christian, the Judeo-Christian and the Gnostic. None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene. It simply isn\u0027t serious to reject the ancient documents in favor of modern texts of questionable value, as Michael Baigent does. Of course, a conspiracy theorist might claim that the ancient documentation is lacking due to a massive cover-up. But such an argument, compelling as it may sound, is worthless to the historian, who must work with the real evidence, meager as it may be. A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of little help. Besides, how many sects or cults have managed to keep their esoteric secrets? Very few indeed. There is always a defector or infiltrator somewhere. The idea that the biggest secret of all times was revealed by a confused French right-wing extremist only 40 years ago is very hard to take seriously. Indeed, the fact that not even heretical groups like the Gnostiscs claimed that Jesus had sired children, is good evidence against the claim. The Gnostics, after all, made all kinds of peculiar statements. But not this one. Why? \n\nWhy are books like \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\" and \"The Da Vinci Code\" so popular? Perhaps they say what many people want to hear. That in itself is somewhat damning, I think. For how many people want to hear the truth? \n",

    "\nThis is a revolutionary book. It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. It\u0027s questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it\u0027s bane as an introduction).\n\nHowever, the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.\n\n(The following is a charicature of the author\u0027s argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, \"All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify\" (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)\n\nThere are other arguments, obviously, and the statement \"we can draw a parallel with other situations\" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? My answer: No. Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a \"reality\".\n\nI hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. Where the author goes outside of common sense, he\u0027s wrong, sometimes plainly so. This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. Where \"evidence\" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. In short, this isnt a scientific study at all. \n\nMy final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction \"A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants\" (15). This is a curios definition. Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. He didnt. He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.\n\nSo an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. Why wont this subject go away? This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings\n",

    "\nI would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well. The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).\n\nThe book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.\n\nThis book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.\n\nThe book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.\n\nThe book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.\n\nSo once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.\n\nWhile that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this\n",

Today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very different thing indeed, and Grimes should know the difference.  The are innumerable other examples available in the same vein.\nAdditionally, Grimes give us  \"food lists\" scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them.  For example, there is a list of Varieties of Apples.  48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking.  Sure \"Red Delicious\" apples have an insipid definition in the \"R\" section but what about the more interesting varieties like \"Sundowner\", or \"Lodi\" apples?  No further mention of them can be found in the book.  There is also a huge list of  \"Fish and Seafood\" but if you are intrigued by what the \"Geoduck\" or \"Sprat\" listed might be, you\u0027re out of luck (without running to a REAL culinary dictionary).\nThe bright (if limited) spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history.  There are 7 of them (reprints from other publications and various authors) that are each informative and interesting.  Grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these little insightful gems and left the definitions to those more inspired by the subject.\nMy guess is that the brevity of the definitions (leading to rampant deficiencies) was, perhaps, an attempt at simplicity but the effective \"dumbing-down\" of the book is insulting to anything but the most elementary reader.  I know that Grimes, a former restaurant reviewer for the New York Times, must know a lot more about food than this book makes him sound.  Grimes is listed as the \"editor\" of this work (along with a number of others) and it defies logic why he would allow his name used as the primary.\nUnfortunately, my copy of this book is destined for \"re-gifting\" or a permanent place on a dusty shelf somewhere while my venerable, dog-eared Larousse Gastronomic retains it\u0027s place of honor near my desk.\nBon appetite, ex libris, and caveat emptor.

    "\nI had expected an insightful analysis of the motivations behind modern terrorism. Instead I got a diatribe against western liberalism. Lee Harris is the poster child for the modern John Birchers, people who believe our way is not only the best way, its the only way. In an increasingly global economic and political system, his view of the world can be said to be outmoded, at best quaint, at worst pathological for if we are truely to address the problems facing humanity over the next 100 years, we will need tolerance and inclusivness.\n",
    "\nI enjoy this work, lots of fresh observations and connections.... but having read it in the light of recent trends in the e-biz world, it sounds thin and delusional...a lot like Tom Peters after way too much espresso. There ARE consequences from CONTINUALLY embracing change...and, in my experience ALL of them are BAD. I wonder on what real-world  EXPERIENCE Mr. Kelly bases his thinking. My advice, embrace chaos and change, but do it VERY CAREFULLY...because it will definitely have consequences.  Truth \u0026amp; Beauty!  -Bv\n",
    "\nThe only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I\u0027ve read a number of James Patterson books and while I\u0027m not a hard core fan, I\u0027ve enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I\u0027m not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell. \n\nAs mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour). \n\nPatterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn\u0027t have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller. \n\nThe twists at the end - \"he\u0027s the wolf - no, he\u0027s the wolf - no, she\u0027s the wolf - no....\" by the end, I just didn\u0027t care. \n\nJames Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson\u0027s priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end.\n",

    "\nMark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it\u0027s past its prime, maybe I don\u0027t have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn\u0027t relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.\n",
    "\nWhile it is true that Brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking.  I returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife.  I\u0027m very tender when it comes to wildlife, and while I know that death is a natural part of the life cycle, I am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures.

    "\nI saw this book at a friend\u0027s shortly after seeing the movie.  I asked her if I could borrow it.  She said I wouldn\u0027t want to.  She\u0027d been trying to read it for awhile, and didn\u0027t like it.  I decided to try anyway.  Unfortunately, my friend was right.  This is a definite case of a movie being much better than a book.  I really liked the movie.  However, the book is too long and boring.  There are so many tangents in it that have nothing to do with the central story.  I can\u0027t believe I even finished it.  Rent the movie-don\u0027t waste your time on the book\n",
    "\nWhile this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make.\nFirstly, it is apparent that the author\u0027s own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented.\nSecondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material.\nFinally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.\n\nHaving said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading\n",
    "\nThere are two things which tickle me about this book.  One is the sample Zack\u0027s report at the back which has a strong buy #1 rating on a -.3% return on equity stock.  The other is the section on practical use of the system.  It, of course, is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 - 3 months.  And don\u0027t forget about growth investors and value investors either.  This section is so short as to be laughable.  Also notice that in the 2002 A list there were 216 stocks.  Most are going to have to buy a subset.  But what subset?  No info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class.

    "\nI zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it\u0027s very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I\u0027ve ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.\n\nIt\u0027s a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.  \n\nOnce in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN\u0027 PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.  \nGee, what a lovely sofa..\n",
    "\nThis book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms, bubbles, and busts.\n\nPrechter should have left it at that.  Instead, he offers up predictions.  Big mistake.  This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so-called Elliott \"wave counts.\"   He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up, 3-down pattern.  If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move, you just don\u0027t understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market.  He\u0027s imposing his theory on the market, but surprisingly enough, the market doesn\u0027t care.  It does whatever it wants, in however many waves it wants, and Bob has been very frustrated at the market\u0027s aberrant behavior lately.  He got lucky early in his career, but it seems he\u0027s been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the \u002787 crash.  \n\nAny superstitution can \"seem\" to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures.  Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you\u0027ll find what you\u0027re looking for.  Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts, and you\u0027ll find those too.  The market doesn\u0027t care about any of those things, though.  It\u0027s nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices, which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully.  University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave, like most, is no better than random stock selection. \n\nIf Prechter had chosen the random method, he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market.  Unfortunately, he has been getting everything from the Dow, to oil (he thought it was going to $10), to gold (he didn\u0027t think it could break $400), to deflation (the \"deflation\" scare ended shortly after this book came out) WRONG in the past couple of years.  He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 (not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED) because his charts tell him it should (they\u0027ve been telling him that since about 1990, actually).  Prechter doesn\u0027t understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system, all of which render \"Dow 400\" among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population (I don\u0027t think Prechter is counting on that).\n\nOur debt-heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon, perhaps by the end of the decade.  It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates.  But it\u0027s not happening now and it\u0027s not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade.\n\nThis book came out near the bottom of the 2000-2002 stock bear market, just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market.  How typical.  While promoting the book, Prechter said it was \"definite\" that stocks would \"crash\"\nin 2003.  He said that 2003 would be \"the best year yet\" for bears (short sellers).  Late into 2003, when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong, Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004, the Dow would \"certainly\" fall below 5,000.  Wrong again!  Since his Fibonacci turn dates and Elliott wave counts fail to portend the future, maybe next he\u0027ll tell us he\u0027s found the secret code to the stock market from the text count of Nostradamus\u0027 writings.\n\nBob Prechter couldn\u0027t call the market if it was listed in the Yellow Pages.  This guy couldn\u0027t time the market if you gave him a stopwatch.  He\u0027s throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as \"definite\" and \"certain.\"  He\u0027s either a liar or a true believer in his own irrational superstitions.  In either case, he\u0027s not credible.\n\nHere\u0027s all you really need to know: Buy dividend stocks.  Buy short-term bonds.  Buy gold.  Hang on to them.  Do that and you\u0027ll do better than you will trying to follow the prognostications of market gurus.  Plus, you\u0027ll have a lot more time to devote to family, fun, and productive activities\n",
    "\nThis is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz\u0027s recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in \"The Hideaway\" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.\n\nThe Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.\n\nI don\u0027t know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.\n\nThe final issue is Koontz\u0027s near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz\u0027s tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.\n\nDean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts\n",
    "\nMcKnight\u0027s concerns about communities\u0027 dependency on professional assistance are legitimate, but disturbingly overstated in this book.   \n\nIn the end I felt McKnight\u0027s trashing of the already well-trodden government provision of social services may not be altogether helpful to distressed communities.  He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the pernicious effects wrought by years of discrimination.  Any debate over when and where and how social programs can be effective is cast aside as well, since in McKnight\u0027s picture, social programs and the professional service providers are, in fact, the vilains and culprits for most of what ails society.  \n\nOne of the damaging fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not able to be both professional and caring - the two are deemed mutually incompatible.  Mcknights views resonate with employers\u0027 caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or, perhaps, health insurance.   \n\nWhat is further implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more institutionalized professional services.  It seems implied that communities had no problems before the social programs to solve them came into being.  In this, I think I see McKnight is invokeing an idealized notion of an society at an earlier time; maybe his argument would have seemed more reasoble in a time when families were less geographically mobile and may have constituted an economic unit, when the elderly lived shorter lives and were less numerous themselves with more children to care for them, and the local economic activities were more functionally interdependent.  \n\nBut McKnight\u0027s model for today\u0027s cure doesn\u0027t seem to fit today\u0027s conditions.  On the other hand, McKnights solutions may be the only ones available in a society where budget cuts and elimination of social services seem the prevailing trend.\n",

    "\nProf. Gardner\u0027s book is disappointing. He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first. Also, his language is inflated, and lacking in philosopical specificity. For example, he believes in building up the inner world of \"mental representations\" [unexplained term] yet insists on \"performances of understanding\" [another unexplained term]. \n\nAlso, he has respect for the individual learner and individual differences, yet he is concerned about the \"position\" or \"situation\" or social class dynamics in which the learning takes place. Thus, he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class, race, or gender.  The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored; and responsibility is not explored.  In short, it is extremely difficult to pin down Prof. Gardner. It would be kind to say he is eclectic. I hope it\u0027s just not fuzzy thinking.\n\nHowever, we can discern that he has a romantic obsession with beauty, truth, and goodness. Imagine -- the Holocaust is reduced to being an illustration of what goodness is or is not! His treatment of these ideas is superficial and banal. I don\u0027t like to be so judgmental, but his writing about them does not deserve a detailed analysis.\n\nWhen attacking E.D. Hirsch whom he calls the main speaker for \"cultural literacy,\" he sets up a straw man. He says that Hirsch\u0027s school of thought has an underlying belief in the Lockeian \"tabula rasa.\" Yet, I find nothing in Hirsch\u0027s writings to indicate that he believes in a tabula rasa. \n\nFurther, is Prof. Gardner really less elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed? I have found that the Harvard elite spend their entire lives trying to achieve and learn everything, and be on top. Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree; yet, he debunks time-honored and experience-honored content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its best. Thus, I find a certain inherent dishonesty in Gardner\u0027s presentation.  \n\nBelieve me, friends, I have taught students who have many ideals, Greek ideals and other ideals, but know very little, nor do they aspire to learn. If they have those ideals, and if they are facile and glib, will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner?\n\nI find a tendency on Prof. Gardner\u0027s part to oversimplify certain issues like the Holocaust, and to overcomplicate certain others like the nature of intelligence. \n\nThe world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be re-written.  Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no fundamental difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school? Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian?  Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a univocal definition of intelligence? I don\u0027t think so. Rather, we all know we are dependent on each other, and that everybody has some unique aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for, but trying to elevate this understanding to a higher level of truth or intellectual significance seems to me to be illegitimate. \n\nLastly, his writing style is a bit too fond of adjectives, and the book reads as a whole like It Takes A Village by Mrs. Clinton. The Disciplined Mind has a mellifluous style that presents itself as being highly sophisticated and, at the same time, as down-to-earth, with balanced common sense. Yet, ultimately, the book is boring.  As one Amazon reviewer states, Prof. Gardner is full of himself.  \n\nIn this book, there is no straightforward discussion or emphasis placed on knowledge, justice, Judeo-Christian values, persistence, responsibility, or character development...words which I find essential for a true philosophy of education.\n\n",
    "\nBECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.  The book is structured around eight \u0027roles\u0027 of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.  While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.  The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.  Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.

The protagonist herself was brilliant and complex. So naturally, I expected the same thing out of Swimming Sweet Arrow. Man, was I disappointed. This was yet another trashy tale about a pathetic woman\u0027s masochistic sex life, pathetic obsession with brutal men, and pathetic quest for attention. Her entire life is a meta-existence: rather than desiring, she desires to be desired. Rather than enjoying, she enjoys being enjoyed. The male characters and the female characters are written by someone who has never met a male or female who didn\u0027t exhibit the most common stereotypes; in her world, all men are sensation-craving brutes, and all women are attention-craving doormats. The men want drugs, fun, and sex, and the women whine and cry and enjoy nothing--not the drugs, not the sex, just being a victim due to the attention it provides.

He talks very little about communication skills. Also you won\u0027t find much on personality traits or compatibility. \nWhen I began a relationship with my girlfriend I read this book. I don\u0027t regret reading it, but it lacks in a lot of areas. Part of this is due to the fact that I don\u0027t know what credentials Joshua Harris has to make his claims. He is not a Phd, or a relationship or family counselor. He had two substantial romantic relationships in his life. One with the girl who inspired him to write his first book, and the other with his current wife. When it comes to relationships, I would hardly call Joshua Harris and authority on the subject. He has no more experience or wisdom that the average person who would pick his book up off the shelf.\nI support the crux of what Harris talks about. I respect the fact that him and his wife Shannon waited to their wedding day for their first kiss. The book is chivalrous and romantic.

Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual. The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger. I was extremely disappointed with this book\n",

The author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same-sex parent, he can determine the birth order of your ideal match.  My father was 3rd and I was 2nd, thus I should pair with a 4th born.  Anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo-science.  There are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions.  Not every Nth born is the same, and no relationship between Nth and Mth borns can be analysed this way.

    "\n\"OF PARADISE AND POWER\" - BY ROBERT KAGAN\n\n\"Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus\" - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows, this line by Robert Kagan author of \"Of Paradise And Power\", has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-Atlantic relations. Kagan\u0027s thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship, not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book. Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book, in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe. In the chapter \"The Power Gap\", Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars. He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power. He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - \"Psychologies of Power and Weakness\". Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies, but change perspectives as well. He claims Europe\u0027s paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods. This chapter culminates into \"Hyperpussiance\", a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia, highlighting Europe\u0027s failure and America\u0027s effectiveness in handling the situation. He finally presents his central argument in the chapters \"The Post Modern Paradise\" and \"The World America Made\" where Kagan states, \"Europe\u0027s evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it.\" Casting doubts on Europe\u0027s intentions, Kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of Europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west\u0027 in his chapter \"Is It Still `The West\u0027\"? \nFinally, it seems Kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the US-\nEurope divide in his concluding chapter, \"Adjusting to Hegemony\", by simply stating one line - \"the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the new reality of American hegemony\". This extremely small book, as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining. There are many issues to be addressed in Kagan\u0027s brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims, reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled. While there is a tone of underlying bias (in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds), Kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures, not to mention present stark paradoxes, and the essay lacks sufficient citings.  \n\n    To start with, let me point out the contradictions in Kagan\u0027s arguments, the presence of which highly undermines his claims, leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument. Kagan claims, \"Europe\u0027s relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful European interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power...rules of behavior\" (pg.37). He goes on to say, - \"Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions, either individually or collectively as `Europe,\u0027 it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves.\"(pg.38) in contrast to \"...Europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power\" (pg.53-54). Kagan contradicts his own views, stating many times that Europe is militarily weak, nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time, puts forth an argument of Europe\u0027s capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the US. \n    In the chapter, Psychologies of Power and Weakness, Kagan\u0027s one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential. He first explains Europe\u0027s greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past, which it has suffered from. He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat\u0027 when confronting a bear (pg.31). But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to, when he says \"They could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so\" (pg.54). So this forces me to ask a question, would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune? So isn\u0027t it quite possible that Europeans feel safe, not because they \"...enjoy the `free ride\u0027 they have gotten under the American security umbrella over the past six decades\" (pg.54), but rather because there was and is no real threat at all?\n\n    With the use of phrases such as \"The Axis of Evil\" and \"Rouge States\" (pg.30), which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran, not to mention his references to `Weapons of Mass Destruction\u0027 (which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq), which still seem to be elusive for some reason, he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation. While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not, he might want to explain as to why, in 1997, he (Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East, irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran. \n\"The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein...\nFrom an American perspective, the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene. Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve; retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region.\"(pg.17 - Rebuilding America\u0027s Defenses - *1) \nThis forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking\u0027 of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia.\n    Some of his reasoning, analysis and analogies seem to be too nave. When explaining military action, one cannot justify it by saying, \"When you have a hammer, all problems start to look like nails\". The author speaks about the nation\u0027s (US\u0027s) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so. Without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression, the author seems to be content in justifying use of force, simply because one has it. One important aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing US-Europe feud. While I have discussed some economical aspects later in the review, one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol (apart from Clinton\u0027s negotiation of it (pg.45)). The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants (www.climnet.org - *2). While there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire, disagreements over the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty for example, which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet, needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations (www.bbcnews.com - *3, 4)\n\n    For a book which covers issues from the pre World War II decade (occasionally going back to ancient philosophy) to the present issues, 72 citations, from which many are simply extended explanations (for examples, see supra notes- 19, 20, 22), seem to be alarmingly low, especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention, certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts. Kagan mentions, \"As `some\u0027 Europeans put it, the real division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes\" (pg.23), yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement. He says, \"The vast majority of Europeans always believed that the threat (if any) posed by Saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him\" along with other alleging statements like, \"The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein\u0027s Iraq is precisely what they(Europe) sought\" (pg.44) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs. Strangely, he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20, pg.30, \"for that matter, this is also the view commonly found in American textbooks\". One might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations. Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay. He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a Hobbesian perspective while Europeans are followers of Kantinian policies. Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact, that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of \"all against all\", the only reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth. Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes (Hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `Hobbes Dilemma\u0027) to justify American aggression, but no where in Hobbes\u0027 theory is aggression justified by the sovereign (Leviathan - Ch.17). \n\n    There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an American idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion. He concludes that while the US was providing \"free security\" to Europe after the Cold War, \"...America\u0027s great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations...\" (pg.34) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically. Kagan further asserts his point when he says, \"Given America\u0027s willingness to spend so much money protecting them, Europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs, long vacations and shorter workweeks\" (pg.54). These are inaccurate presentations of facts, which are more of subjective, bias ideologies. I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements. First, America\u0027s interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War. One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the Soviet advance was purely for selfish motives, rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire (Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says, \"With the check of the Soviet power removed, the United States was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose...\"(pg26)). Second, when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a \"$9 trillion \" economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare, as he calls them \"free-riders\", results in a faulty analysis.\n\nWhen I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts, the example of the Balkans, which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant. Kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth US benevolence and European incapacity. \"American involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow American `national interest\u0027...While Americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing,... the US had no `national interest\u0027 at stake in the Balkans\"(pg.50), this is how Kagan sees it. Indeed stopping genocide was a concern, but was it the only concern? While Milosevic had very much agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts, none seem to have been interested in his offer; they rather wanted complete access and control to all of Yugoslavia. The Rambouillet Accord, to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the last day of the conference held at Paris, one must note was the primary reason for rejecting NATO troops, as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty. Yet, he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo (http://wsws.org *5). \n    Some thing missing from Kagan\u0027s entire book are the words \"Latin America\" and \"Africa\". As seen above, Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world, before and after the Cold War. But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any American intervention in Latin America (official or not), Africa or the Far East for that matter. Those who are well aware of the world around them, will be aware of America\u0027s support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East, Indonesia for example, which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the Latin American and African countries were a threat to Europe, hence the interventions and no mention of them? (A complete timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on multiple sites *6, 7, 8) \n\n    There is one severe `defect\u0027, as I put it, which undermines the entire argument of this book. Kagan\u0027s tunneled vision approach, which refers to the word `power\u0027 only in terms of military strength and capabilities, ultimately results in a false dichotomy, which is the stumbling stone for his thesis. Kagan believes the world and in particular, Europe, is left with two options, that either they follow the US or be a tacit audience. The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it, is due to his convergent view. \"Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by Lilliputian threads\", says Kagan, \"American leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all, that Europe is not really capable of constraining the US\". He reinforces this claim throughout his book (see pg- 33, 37-40, 59, 62, etc). The author\u0027s abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting, highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims. Kagan has committed serious errors here, by ignoring Europe\u0027s strength, not military but political and economical indeed. With a population of 456,953,258 (the CIA Fact Book *9) and still growing, the EU, leave aside Europe, cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture. Europe is economically strong enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to, the recent problems over the genetically altered meat, banana dispute, steel industry debacle, Airbus-Boeing clash and many more, have all proved that Europe\u0027s economic strength is much of a concern for the US.  While I must point out a rank deletion, I believe this is `the\u0027 single factor which is capable for arguing against all of Kagan\u0027s thesis and arguments, and that is the American Economy. Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of American economy (2001), even though problems did exist when he wrote this book. He seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending, \"...the US can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future\". Strangely, the growing inflation rate, rising unemployment, stagflation, trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession, were I believe dismissed as myths by the author (for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com; http://wsws.org *10, 11). Also, Kagan\u0027s final solution suggest that, \"The obvious answer is that Europe should.... and build up its military, even if only marginally\", leaves me with a conundrum. Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race, this time Cold War II? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those, whose ideologies are in tandem with his. Hence, I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here, as we all know, there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts.\n\nWhile I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics (which Kagan ignores) on the US-Europe relation, there is something I must point out before I end this review. Kagan, rather conveniently digresses of the topic, which is transatlantic relationships, to justifying US hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion. While most Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan\u0027s ideology (as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12), leave aside Europeans or rest of the world, Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it. This was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book, where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is \"Adjusting to Hegemony\". When Kagan says how many (statistics seem to abandon him) Americans believe that by advancing their interest, they advance the interest of humanity, he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home, he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - \"America\u0027s cause is the cause of all mankind\" and again I must bring to the author\u0027s notice, the recipient of these remarks is an international audience, which is diverse, has its own culture and heritage, religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other.  An author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed. While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a \"go it alone\" attitude (pg.39, 99), it does not abide by the UN Security Council (pg.40, 99), takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws (pg.45, 61, 99), is justified in adopting `double standards\u0027 (pg.62, 99), he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day (or rather the day when he wrote this book) situation and the growing unpopularity of American foreign policy around the world. While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America\u0027s imperialistic goals, a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects international laws, human rights, collective public opinion and most of all - peace. He fails to give an impartial, if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying, \"...a little common understanding can still go a long way\". While many have nothing but words of praise, as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - \"Brilliant\" (a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America\u0027s Defense Project) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger, [against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied, who ironically, Kagan terms as a \"quintessential realist\". See - http://en.wikipedia.org(for cases) *13; http://www.thenation.com(for list of crimes) *14] the book is a \"seminal treatise\" which would \"shape the (US-Europe relation) discussion for years to come\"; I do not particularly endorse it it. As I have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument, sane reasoning or supportive evidence, though its lucid prose, easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read, it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution, apart from scratching the surface, `the military surface\u0027. Indeed the book did create waves in the political arena, which was probably due to its impeccable timing, but I cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be \"discussed for years to come\".\n \n\n\n*1   - http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf\n*2   - http://www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html\n*3   - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm\n*4   - http://212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm\n*5   - http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/apr1999/yugo-a14.shtml\n*6   - http://www.atrocities.net/ \n*7   - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html \n*8   - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm\t\n*9   - http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html\n*10 - http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/dec2000/us-d30.shtml\n*11 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm\n*12 - http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php\n*13 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger\n*14 - http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid\u003d3\u0026pid\u003d17\n",

I truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom.   However there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover.  By maintaining a position of gallant \"ladies first\" mentality he, in truth, is demeaning the power of women\u0027s sexuality.\n\nThere is much to be gained by men reading this book.

It is full of painfully obvious advice such as \"Don\u0027t play with your food\" or \"Do not throw golf clubs... in anger.\" Anyone raised in America (presuming that is the author\u0027s intended audience) who doesn\u0027t already understand these things and take them to heart isn\u0027t going to be interested in reading about them in a book, if they can even read. Chapter 15 deals with Staring and differences where the author admonishes: \"Do not repeat racist, sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence.\" If you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this. If you are, this book isn\u0027t going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it. I found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet. If the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated, dream on! I think the author has a Professor Henry Higgins Jones. I am also concerned about my father\u0027s opinion of me, I mean \"Do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store.\" Duh\n",

    "\nI had high hopes when I picked up this book because Styron is a terrific writer and I was interested in the subject. By the time I was done I nearly threw it across the room.

In Darkness Visible, Styron maintains egomaniacal control of his subject through aloof detachment, showcasing a carefully polished veneer, never inviting the reader in.\n",
    "\nAs someone very interested in urban exploration (especially in the subways) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it. After reading many of these Amazon reviews though, I opted out of a purchase, and took it out of my Bronx library instead. Thank goodness as I only wasted valuable time, and not any money.\n\nThis book is a sham. It is obviously mostly fiction. And it\u0027s boring fiction at that. The book is divided into chapters, each chapter a new \"adventure.\" \n\nI read the subway one first, where the \"explorers\" take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line, to see the City Hall Station, which opened in 1904 (NYC\u0027s first station) and closed in 1948. The station is located on the loop of the 6 train, that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge. First of all, anyone can go on this \"adventure.\" Just stay on the train at the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge, and that\u0027s it. Despite the author\u0027s attempt to make this sound risky, no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on (like they really care), just sit down. The author created some \"European tourists\" that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop, and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying \"are we on the wrong train?\" Well, unless all those huge \"6\" signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read, then you probably got on the correct train. The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give public tours all the time through this station (and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more) but stopped after 9-11. This chapter was a joke.\n\nI started reading the other chapters, and saw they were no better. I then started to breeze through the book. One thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all. This, despite the fact that on page 67 the author states, \"Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle...\"  But no photos of their \"adventures\" are in the book. Why? Because it\u0027s fiction. \n\nThere are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring, sure, that\u0027s easy. There\u0027s even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere, ooo. Buit no pics of the actual \"adventures.\" I guess \"Josh\" lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed.\n\nThe funny thing is, you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself. Especially the City Hall station, there are tons of pictures of it available from the people that were in there during the tours.\n\nJust stay away from this sham of a book, it\u0027s really a huge waste of time\n",

    "\nI received this book as a gift.  I was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as Bob Novak and Sean Hannity.  Haven\u0027t any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book?  No.  And with good reason.  It\u0027s not a history book, it\u0027s a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk \"the faithful\" out of their hard-earned dollars.\n\nI did read several chapters of the book to be fair.  When Crocker describes the Papal forces during the Albigensian crusade as \"soldiers of God, overcoming all the odds to destroy the wicked oppression challenging the authority of the church.\"  I wanted to puke.  And how about the Inquisition, where Church authorities sanctioned physical torture against \"heretics?\"  Well, Crocker concedes that torturing someone might stray a little bit from Christ\u0027s original message of tolerance... but hey, they threatened the authority of the righteous Catholic church, so they got what they deserved.  Uh, yeah, amen brother.  \n\nThese considerations aside, the book isn\u0027t even well researched, which immediately destroys its credibility with me.  For example from the Albigensian crusade, Crocker states that the armies of the heretics numbered over 100,000, yet with only a few thousand men, the Pope was able to defeat them, as they were filled with the \"glory of god\" or something like that.  Curiously, in his footnotes he cites nothing to back this claim up.  Maybe because it isn\u0027t true.  And any cites to books that have been critical of church policy, like, say, endorsing Mussolini, are derided as \"unresearched,\" \"politically motivated\" and \"shameful\"\n\nIronically, that\u0027s exactly what \"Triumph\" is to me\n",

And indeed, religion and rationality need not be foes, as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Stephen Jay Gould. Reduces our choices to \"religion or madness\" is just silly.\n\nSchaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality, but authoritarianism with a clerical face.

    "\nLike many others in my book group, I had been looking forward to finally reading something by Pamuk. And like most of my book group, I was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him. Originally published in Turkey in 1985, the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one Faruk Darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive. He then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated, but much of it can\u0027t. This should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes. Even more so if the reader knows that Darvinoglu is the protagonist of Pamuk\u0027s earlier book The House of Silence. Such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of Calvino, Borges, and their ilk.\n\nThe basic plot is very straightforward: in the mid 17th-century, a young Venetian gentleman is captured by Turkish raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring Turkish scholar who happens to look just like him. The two men then spend the next few decades cloistered together, engaged in various psuedo-intellectual investigations of astronomy, biology, engineering, and so on. These bring them to the attention of the Sultan (based on Mehmet IV), whose patronage waxes and wanes, culminating in a lengthy attempt to construct a powerful war machine. Along the way, their claustrophobic relationship swings back and forth, and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague, whose outcome they are tasked with predicting. The book concludes with a brief section which will challenge the reader\u0027s assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it. Namely, are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a single person?\n\nThis all unfolds at a glacial pace, and the two \"characters\" are mere ciphers. Their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page, but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it, and this makes for disengaging reading. Pamuk seems much less interested in storytelling or characters than in grand themes such as the nature of identity, the collision of cultures, and the very nature of reality. But none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly fresh or interesting. The tension between East and West is handled in a fairly superficial manner, as the Turkish master is obsessed with Western advances in science and technology, while the Sultan has a credulous appetite for tall tales and soothsayers. This all comes across as a rather ambivalent satire of the fluidity of Turkish national character. In the end, this is not a particularly good introduction to major modern writer whom many have compared to Eco, Calvino, Borges, Kafka, and Kundera. However, readers who enjoy highly ambiguous works about self-identity with unreliable narrators may find this a satisfying read\n",
    "\nSorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that \"this person escaped her life to be a secretary?\" - good point!

Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn\u0027t have cared less what happened to her anyway!

    "\nThe author comes off as a whining, unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a \u0027stifling\u0027 church environment; further apalled by the Church Founder\u0027s belief, in that it (the Worlwide Church Of God) was God\u0027s True Church through the ages, right on up to the present \u0027end time\u0027. Feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on Herbert W. Armstrong,the Church\u0027s actual teachings, and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole, labeling it a \u0027cult\u0027...and further damning its Pastor General as a \"heretic\", despite the Church\u0027s humanitarian works, publishing, Colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of H.W. Armstrong. Since Armstrong\u0027s death in 1986, Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains, and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic Holy Days, sabbaths, ten commandments (which, in his estimation are now the \u0027ten suggestions\u0027) and general lifestyle of this 7th Day Church Of God denomination. Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership, as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent Church Of God conferences throughout the United States...and continuing the legacy and apostolic, traditional Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1927.\nRecommended reading: \"Autobiography of Herbert W. Armstrong\"; \"Mystery Of The Ages\"; \"The Incredible Human Potential\"\n",

    "\nJohn Katzenbach is an accomplished author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels (The Analyst), so I was surprised at how bad The Shadow Man was.  The premise of the plot is that four very old Jewish people, survivors of the Holecaust, believe they have seen the \"Shadow Man\".  The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps.  These four old people feared the Shadow Man more than anything.  When one of them is killed, a retired police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is.  Meanwhile, the Miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly Jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect.\n\nEventually, Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man, a man of pure evil.  As the book villian, it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s.  Also, this book barely touches on WWII, yet purports at times to be a novel about WWII.  I\u0027ve read a lot of great WWII novels, and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s.  But setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasn\u0027t too exciting.  It wasn\u0027t exciting primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years?  Why was he starting to kill now?  The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill.\n\nFinally, I realized I didn\u0027t like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages.  The entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story.  If you take away the WWII angle, this novel is bad.  The WWII angle adds some excitement, but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII better than this one does.\n\nThe review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated...\"Katzenbach (Just Cause) has some good Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here, but the book is burdened by flat characterization, a slow pace, an odd, unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing.\n",

    "\nJeremy Narby\u0027s The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge, started out decently enough with Narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the Amazon Basin and from there he goes over some interesting ideas regarding DNA and Serpent Myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of Intelligent Design and makes an all out attack on Darwinian Evolution and Science itself.\n\nA number of Narby\u0027s ideas regarding DNA and Shamanism are intriguing enough but he has apparently decided that all Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology, while he freely admits that he is being very reductionist on this point, I still see many problems with his view that Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology at heart. His argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the Serpent/Dragon which is present in many different mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins. He decides that this is in actually a representation of DNA as viewed by Shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and shamanic visions are actually DNA. Since DNA emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication (along with the traditional chemical communication) Narby believes that in shamanic trances the shaman becomes able to see the light emitted by DNA (which often show up as snakes) and the shaman communicates with the individual bits of DNA (which is conscious) and the entire linked network of DNA based life. As justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light, to him this is almost literally correct as the spirits are actually DNA and communicate through light as \"spirits\".\n\nFrom there he goes on to say that all ladders, staircases, and ropes in shamanic quests are representations of DNA and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along DNA and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking down to the world of Molecular Biology (although since one can apparently work with and see DNA in the middle world one must ask why one would need to shrink down). While these views might make for some interesting theological discussion about some shamanic practices, Narby seems to have ignored the psychological aspects of visions and quests and any elements other than snakes or other things that just happen to be long and thin. Given Narby\u0027s view of spirits as DNA one must ask what spiritual helpers/allies are? Is someone\u0027s spiritual guides DNA in some bacteria on my hand? Will I kill Yahweh by washing my hands with anti-bacterial soap (hey maybe that\u0027s why Jesus decided that washing one\u0027s hands was bad!)?\n\nA lot of his proof is like the proof of Erich von D�niken except that where D�niken saw aliens and spacecraft, Narby sees DNA and Molecules. Take for example this D�niken-esque proof from the book:\n\n\"The second was a rock painting of the Rainbow Snake. I looked at it more closely and saw two things: All around the serpent there were sorts of chromosomes, in their upside-down \"U\" shape, and underneath it there was a kind of ladder!\" (p. 79)\n\nBy Chapter 10, entitled Biology\u0027s Blind Spot, Narby has decided that Evolution is Wrong and all of Science must be toppled. This bit seems to have come out of nowhere like someone spliced a Pro-Intelligent Design rant into a book where it didn\u0027t belong and as with all Pro-ID and Creationist literature we get the same old faulty attacks again and again. Attacks such as Evolution being based on a Circular argument because the most fit species survive to spread their genes and therefore are more fit. Yes, that is the definition of fitness, and sometimes the basis of things start as tautologies such as the Theory of Gravity but like Gravity Natural Selection and evolution is justified and testable by looking at it\u0027s predictive power. Population genetics and mathematics shows clearly that natural selection is very predictive and has so far not been falsified. Similarly, we can also look at the fossil record in geological strata for evidence of evolutionary change over time.\n\nAfter that attack Narby then attacks the Central Dogma (Which is how transcription of DNA to proteins works) by misinterpreting what Francis Crick meant. Crick never meant the word Dogma in Central Dogma to be taken in the sense it is used in religion instead he meant it as a joke name for a grand hypothesis that he had at the time little actual experimental evidence for. Narby misinterprets Crick\u0027s joke to argue that evolution is apparently Faith based, since this argument has no basis in reality it falls flat immediately.\n\nHe then argues that ants and other animals are fully conscious because they do amazing things that seem to require forethought and they tap into DNA like shamans to do things. Higher animals are smart and may have consciousness but ants are pretty dumb. One is reminded of Edward Selous and others\u0027 ideas about thought-transference to explain how flocks of birds move and how ants and termites build hives, as it turns out birds flocking behaviour operates on simple instinctual rules (clustering, maintaining speed, and appropriate distance) and so are Ant Nesting behaviours. One proof of this is to put food just out of the reach of ants, and some dirt underneath, while they understand how to move earth and tunnel they will never purposely move earth to build ramps, bridges, or tunnels to reach a goal. The birds who flew in flocks and the ancestors of ants who had developed nesting behaviour managed to survive better and so these behaviours somehow became instincts and persisted.\n\nNow Narby makes the extremely tired argument that life is too complicated to be determined by chance alone, and he is correct on this matter. Too bad there is more than chance guiding evolution, we also have Natural Selection guiding the process, to quote Richard Dawkins: \"Life results from the non-random survival of randomly varying replicators.\" The combinations which work survive and prosper and are kept in the population. Narby argues \"How can a small telephone directory of information emerge from random processes?\" (P. 142) to answer this I wish to quote a bit of Michael Shermer\u0027s 25 Creationists\u0027 Arguments and 25 Evolutionists\u0027 Answers which nicely illustrates how natural selection can produce Shakespeare\u0027s Hamlet quickly from random letters:\n\n\"Natural selection is not \"random\" nor does it operate by \"chance.\" Natural selection preserves the gains and eradicates the mistakes. The eye evolved from a single, light-sensitive cell into the complex eye of today through hundreds if not thousands of intermediate steps, many of which still exist in nature. In order for the monkey to type the first 13 letters of Hamlet\u0027s soliloquy by chance, it would take 26 to the power of 13 number of trials for success. This is 16 times as great as the total number of seconds that have elapsed in the lifetime of the solar system. But if each correct letter is preserved and each incorrect letter eradicated, the process operates much faster. How much faster? Richard Hardison constructed a computer program in which letters were \"selected\" for or against, and it took an average of only 335.2 trials to produce the sequence of letters TOBEORNOTTOBE. This takes the computer less than 90 seconds. The entire play can be done in about 4.5 days!\"\n\nNarby also tries to argue that gaps in the fossil record such as in whale evolution and other places where there are few or no intermediate forms indicate that evolution has not occurred. This however just means that in this instance there are gaps in the fossil record because the fossils have not been found yet. Narby also points to the seemingly rapid appearance of species in the fossil record as an argument against evolution. Apparently Narby has never heard of Punctuated Equilibrium.\n\nNarby stunningly also tries to argue that because large portions of DNA is identical over many different species that this somehow indicates design, unfortunately for Narby a lot of these identical sequences of DNA code for the basic processes of life. A human who couldn\u0027t cope with oxygen or a fox which could not metabolize energy would not last long in this world. The fact that these sequences are identical is actually a point for evolution because the same processes have been preserved and we even see similar basic skeletal structures in animals even when it is not efficient or useful such as digits in the fins of dolphins or the appendix in humans.\n\nFinally, we come back full circle to his argument about Natural Selection being a form of circular logic and he ties to paint Evolution as unfalsifiable (No, we can test it\u0027s predictions in such fields as Genetics and Palaeontology) and being denounce by an increasing number of scientists (not at all true).\n\nAll in all while Narby has some interesting nuggets of information and ideas in The Cosmic Serpent he ultimately seems to squander these ideas by jumping around in random directions and to strange conclusions based on very little evidence\n",

In her utterly unreasoned invective,  Sontag ignores (or is just unable to understand) two critical facts. First,  some works of art and theory are difficult to understand (in varying  degrees) without the help of interpretation. Sontag\u0027s flawed analysis of  the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates  that not only is she among this crowd, she has clearly reached new and  unheard of misguided heights. Second, Sontag ignores the fact that works of  art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help  of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which  aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language. This  couldn\u0027t possibly be clearer than in poetry. Weinberger\u0027s excellent  \u0026quot;Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei\u0026quot;, which adroitly considers  the subject, hadn\u0027t been released when Sontag published this essay but it  probably wouldn\u0027t have made a difference. What was she thinking? The only  good aspect of the essay (and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero)  is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against  individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag\u0027s  writing\n",
    "\nI stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck, all those millions reading Gray\u0027s franchise can\u0027t be wrong.  Plus, I\u0027ve seen Gray on Larry King once, and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy.  This book, though, promising in its intro to be \"sexy\", touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves.  Now, I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it\u0027s warranted (for instance, it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we\u0027d just went to see).  But Gray\u0027s generalizations, dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful, and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so. \n\nAlthough I\u0027m the first to admit that women love compliments, Gray\u0027s suggestions, as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and, occasionally, what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase \"your breasts are wonderful\"?  Read the book!).  Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how, while getting to the undressing part, the man should pull the woman\u0027s panties \"up her crack\" (a.k.a. give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).  And, don\u0027t miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she\u0027s in the mood and at half when she\u0027s not (or maybe it was different colors, I couldn\u0027t read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).\n\nMore annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways, be it foreplay, flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists), that a man always comes (and too quickly, of course), and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom, or your (otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire, I wonder?) approach will become a \"turn-off\".\n\nBottom line (no pun intended):  if you want some light and basic (!) guidance, the book is not too terrible, but if it is \"advanced bedroom skills\" (Gray said that!) that you\u0027re after, you\u0027re better off digging out that old Erica Jong or even any pulp.     \n\n\n",

    "\nI have never read one of Johansen\u0027s books and after reading this one, I\u0027m not likely to read another.  I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn\u0027t get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as \"dear heaven\" and \"lord\" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn\u0027t seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however).  As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn\u0027t leave Geneva wasn\u0027t particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.  Character development was lacking and I just didn\u0027t care that much about them.  I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics.

Even though she\u0027s calling the shots,as it\u0027s her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as \"Ivanhoe\" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it\u0027s the side MM chose to tell,and there\u0027s kernel of truth in the \"myth\" of the Old South,as in all myths.\n\n Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called \"parody\",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O\u0027Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That\u0027s why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O\u0027Hara from Ellen\u0027s childhood.Thank goodness this book isn\u0027t a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn\u0027t even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I\u0027d give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co.

    "\nFor someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it\n",
    "\nThis is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.\n\nWhile Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of \u002747 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends\u0027 tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.\n\nIn the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it\u0027s glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it\u0027s followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of \u0027fu---ng\u0027 as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it\u0027s hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?  \n\nHow this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures\n",
    "\nMiddle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she\u0027s still got the money!)\n\nActually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it\u0027s hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they\u0027re impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer\u0027s insistence on using Gracie\u0027s name as much as possible.  For example:\n\n\"Gracie thought about it; they\u0027d never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife\" (p 38).\n\nI lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It\u0027s very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.\n\nDefinitely not worth your time\n",

    "\nAs a professional, certified chef and baker, I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector. After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the \u0027IACP Cookbook of the Year\u0027 awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the \u0027too good to be true\u0027-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this expensive book. \n\nWhat a dissappointment! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread, wake up! Reinhart\u0027s book is simply flawed. Compared to other bread books, it\u0027s even a quite average book. But one that is luxuriously packaged. A lot of hot colorful expensive air. And it\u0027s expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it, but because of the super luxuriously editing. This is a book for book enthousiasts, not for bakers, professional or home. \n\nI see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools, as information and inspiration. Not as eye candy. If you want nice pictures, buy an art book. A book on baking bread with these awards behind it, should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques, original insights, an appetite for baking, factual info, the newest and tested developments in technique... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip. 47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30-40$ publishing hype.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong: this is a beautiful, expensive book. But one you don\u0027t use in the kitchen, and certainly don\u0027t smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about. But as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge, giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques, as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery, compared to other bread books, this book fails miserably info-wise. But it has a snappy lay out. \n\nJeff Hamelmans \u0027Bread, a Book of Techniques\u0027 and Rose Beranbaums \u0027Bread Bible\u0027 give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking. They talk more about the subject \u0027bread\u0027. And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes. Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris. How about the bread info, the kneading, rising, baking, ingredient- and techniques info? I honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin. Bakers with such big ego\u0027s that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during \u0027a learning trip\u0027 to professional bakers on which she accompanied him, than in another bread formula\u0027s, should work in shobizz, not in a bakery or a culinary school. Big ego\u0027s with more talk than substance galore in the food industry. Reinart is, judging by this book, sadly also one of them. I don\u0027t see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris. Mr.Reinhart: your readers forked out 30-40$ for bread info, not your personal travel experiences. As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil: Stay with the subject! And the subject of this book, for which I paid is \u0027Bread and Baking. If we want to know about your personal life, we\u0027ll read an interview in People, if they find you interesting enough.\n\nPeter Reinharts \u0027The Bread Baker\u0027s Apprentice\u0027 as a \u0027Bread Book\u0027 is simply a marketing creation. Smartly edited, but way too short on substance. There is not much new information on bread. Worse: there is not much info at all! In total for 30-40 $, you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by Ten Speed Press, the editor or this book. Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages, Hamelmans 400 plus pages, that is a big difference for a big price. With Reinharts book, you get a lot of shining white surface that in other Bread books is filled with bread info. As a buyer of this book, you also pay for full page black-and-white and color pictures that are pure filler. See p. 3, 6, 26... And why is the beautiful model Fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr. Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone? With Reinharts next book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest. Package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30-40$. Never mind the content. \n\nLet\u0027s talk a bit about the formula\u0027s. That should be an important part of a baking book, right? And they should be original and fine tuned, right? Sadly to say: nothing new or original here. Some aren\u0027t even fine tuned. And baking is all about fine tuning. Worse, almost all the formula\u0027s can be found in other bread books. And, most insulting for a buyer of this book, a lot of the mere 47 formulas (Reinhart uses this expensive word because \u0027recipe\u0027 propably doesn\u0027t fit into the marketing of this baking book) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts former book \u0027Crust and Crumb\u0027. Clever marketing and ba-da-bing! By the way, \u0027Crust and Crumb\u0027 has been reedited in 2006. At a fair price, I admit. So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a right price without the pomp, sc�nes of a marriage, without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak... buy \u0027Crust and Crumb\u0027 and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves. But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop. As for this book, you should ask yourself: \u0027Do I want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book?\u0027. \n\nTaking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews, as a baking book for the world market, this book is almost worthless. The universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight. Like it or not, but that\u0027s a fact. You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams, kilo\u0027s etc. Reinhart visited French top bakers Poilane and Gosselin, clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking. I don\u0027t think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces! But even then, let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market. But then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula\u0027s itself for the rest of the world. This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic European inspired bread like ciabatta, fougasse... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution! And then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads: the same language, the metric weight system. Rose Beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups/ounces. It\u0027s a simple as that. Bread is a world food, so use the world standard for baking. If not, market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and upfront about that. And don\u0027t give us that inflated hot air babble about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard, the metric wieght system! This big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the USA. The Worldwide Bread Revolution won\u0027t be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide!\n\nNext point: Reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast. Every baker worth his salt (or yeast) will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste, volume and texture. Yeast is a living organism. As \u0027instant yeast\u0027 it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how long. It\u0027s like you force a just woken up coma-patient, that has been dormant for months, years... to run a marathon. Fresh, pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to \u0027instant\u0027 (aka dried) yeast. Try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home, and judge for yourself. To place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments! For scientific back up, you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This \u0027Molecular Gastronomy, Exploring the Science of Flavor\u0027 (Columbia University Press 2006).\n\nAnd it gets worse. Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads. If Poilane hears this, he\u0027ll drop dead! Every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening. Shortening produces a rancid/metallic taste and a slimy, unpleasant mouthfeel. Not to talk about health. Most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat. Read Harvard\u0027s nutrition professor Walter Willets book: \u0027Eat, Drink and be Healthy\u0027 (Free Press 2001). New York has already picked this info up. Professional food writer and teacher Reinhart hasn\u0027t or doesn\u0027t care. For instance, Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in Italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil. In Italian Bread! Come on, let\u0027s be serious. And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America! It\u0027s like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef! If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses, he\u0027ll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a Poilane. \n\nThen there is Reinharts Hygi�ne Problem. There is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). Reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart. The first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns, is that before even touching ingredients, he must remove all the rings on his fingers. Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance, is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast. And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on, is not only very dangerous for the health of customers, it is simply not done for a baker. I like my bread without filth baked in, thank you very much! In the school where I earned my diplome in baking, if a student had a ring on during practical class, he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam. Yet we see professional teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON! See p. 36-37, 82-83, 255, 245... Unforgivable in a \u0027professional\u0027 baking book. And all the more in an expensive book that won the James Beard and IACP awards! Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP, any basic knowledge of food hygiene? Has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygi�ne in a so called \u0027professional Bread Book\u0027? One other thing, for a bread book that pretends to be world class, there is no word about gluten-free bread. Not one formula. And this while more and more people are allergic to gluten (protein in wheat flour).\n\nTo end on a positive note, one thing I found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book, was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread. But, fellow reviewers, you can find all this info and more, and explained more clearly, more detailed and to the point, in Hamelmans \u0027Bread\u0027 and Beranbaums \u0027Bread Bible\u0027. And it doesn\u0027t take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper. Peter, take out all the white empty space, learn to write more clearly and to the point, and you can say the same thing in 20 pages. Which leaves you 35 pages for more formula\u0027s for example. But if you haven\u0027t any formula\u0027s left or are preparing a new book, then, yes, by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20. Why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult, impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego?\n\nSo despite all the hoopla, hyped reviews, near hysterical praise and important awards, this is simply a too expensive, show off-book. It\u0027s like the tale of \u0027the King with no Clothes on\u0027. Somebody has to yell: \u0027Hey, wait a minute!\u0027\n\nIf you want good books on bread baking: buy one by Jeff Hamelman, Rose Beranbaum and Bernard Clayton. You don\u0027t get a model on the cover, but the content is all the better. And in a bread book, isn\u0027t content more important than packaging\n",

Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in \"the history of the horse\") with W.C. Minor\u0027s contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I\u0027ll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer\u0027s, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn\u0027t a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go.\n",
    "\nAs a romantic comedy, Star Wars is a failure.  As a science fiction film, the Annie Hall is a complete disappointment.  Whatever other merits these movies might have, there are definitely areas that they are lacking.  Which brings me to The Rough Guide to Cult Movies:  as a reference book, it is highly suspect.  What\u0027s notable is that Annie Hall fails as sci-fi because it doesn\u0027t try to be that genre; The Rough Guide fails at the very category it aspires to.  Which is too bad, because it is often an interesting read.\n\nThe failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so broad as to be meaningless.  We then a series of chapters representing various \"genres\", some of which are valid (science fiction, westerns, horror), some of which are ridiculous (Animals, Food, Nuns) and some of which are not even true genres (dubbed, independent, straight-to-video).  After this, we get various miscellaneous topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason, such as a list of top movie grosses followed by presidential movie trivia.\n\nThe movie descriptions are often amusing, although there are numerous errors (such as misstating Geoffrey Rush\u0027s role in Pirates of the Caribbean), even more omissions (every reader will find his own; one example is that Unforgiven is missing from Westerns) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a specific genre to fill it out.\n\nWhat saves this book is, even though it fails as a reference book, it is nonetheless entertaining.  I am therefore giving this two stars instead of one.  It\u0027s a rather useless book, especially if you want to learn more about movies, but if you do pick it up, it is probably the most entertaining two-star book that you\u0027re ever likely to read. \n",

At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence.

The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America\u0027s worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben\u0027s last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well.\n",
    "\nI must say that after reading this book, I am more confused than ever as to the origins of the war between Japan and the US.\nThe book starts in 1936, although most knowledgable people know that the march to war really began with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria in 1932.  The author continually repeats the refrain that \"Americans don\u0027t understand the Japanese mentality and culture\", and it was this \"misunderstanding\" that led to the war.\nIt is true that Toland defines the Japanese term \"gekokujo\" as being some sort of \"insubordination\" that led to the Kwantung Army to feel it could move, presumably without orders from Tokyo, into Manchuria. However, Toland does not explain how this could happen. There is little description of the power structure in Japan, we do know that there was some attempt to create parliamentary democracy, but there were also the giant oligarchs who had much power, plus the military hierarchy.  Somehow, the military took control in the 1930\u0027s, but Toland doesn\u0027t really say how.   He describes in detail the \"2/26\" Uprising of young officers in 1936, and how they were willing to kill without compunction, and how fanatical they were, yet we are then told that they OPPOSED expansion into China, and that the repression of this coup attempt would lead to an expanded war in China.  I must say I don\u0027t understand this at all...Toland potrays them as militaristic fanatics, yet they seem to be \"the good guys\".  Weren\u0027t those who supported expansion into China also militaristic fanatics?  This is left totally unexplained.\nToland then goes on to describe the fatal \"Incident at the Marco Polo Bridge\" in 1937 near Peking (Beijing) which led to the full-scale invasion of China.  Toland says the government in Tokyo, again, had nothing to do with it, in fact both the Chinese and Japanese commanders on the spot tried to calm things down, but some undefined \"hotheads\" (possibly Chinese Communists) kept inflaming the situation. Somehow (without Toland telling us how), a decision is made by someone (not necessarily the \"peace-loving\" Japanese Prime Minister Prince Konoye) to mount a full-scale invasion of China.  An impression is left by Toland that the Chinese, particulary, the Koumintang government of Chiang Kai-shek was provocative and unreasonable.  All I know is that\nthat Marco Polo Bridge is within China, and it is understandable\nthat the Chinese would resent the Japanese military presence there.\nAfter this, we move on to the atrocities of the \"Rape of Nanking\", which again, according to Toland, \"somehow\" happens, (Toland does admit that there were atrocities and between 200,000 and 300,000 Chinese were butchered by their \"brother Asians\" who claimed to be liberating them(?)). Toland says the Japanese commander at Nanking did not order any such behavior, nor again, did the government in Tokyo.  How then do thousands\nof supposedly disciplined Japanese troops suddenly get it into their heads to do such things?  Toland doesn\u0027t give us a clue, other than his general statement that \"westerners don\u0027t understand the Japanese\". Toland also, in a way, tries to claim that Western opposition to Japanese expansion into China was \"hypocritical\" because of Western Colonialism in East Asia\n(US in the Philippines; Britain in Hong Kong, Malaya, Burma, India; Dutch in East Indies; French in Indochina), however, by the 1930\u0027s the US had already agreed to give the Philippines\nindependence and the British were beginning to wind down the Raj in India was setting up an autonomous Indian government, so it was\napparent that Colonialism was already on its way out before the war. \nAll this makes me wonder about the various things he says in the book, and I would look for a better source on the tragic history of this period. I have read his books on the end of both World War I and World War II which are much better, so that adds to my disappointment\n",
    "\nThe book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading.  If you don\u0027t know anything about database marketing, then you will get something out of this book.  If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here.  In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole.  The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet.  The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them\n",

I thought one Patricia was enough. But after reading this book, I am faced with the frightening realization that there are TWO of them!\n\nAlso, what I find very disturbing is that this version of Patricia may be even daffier than the original version. After reading just 6 or 7 pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of Patriciaitis and a dose of Kennealyism.\n\nBy the 40th page I was searching for my red slippers so I could click them together and get back to Kansas.

    "\nThis textbook is more useful for the flashy (and admittedly very good) teacher\u0027s ancillaries. But this review is not for the ancillaries. It is for the text itself.\n\nThe text\u0027s treatment of proofs is very cursory and not rigorous enough. The diagrams for the algebraic problems are too confusing, compiling numerous different concepts into one problem. While I agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another, it doesn\u0027t make sense that most, instead of some, diagrams are over-complicated. Personally, I don\u0027t like the format with the examples, mainly because it downplays the necessity for students to become LITERATE in math, not just a good \"example comparer.\" The text has little actual TEXT to speak of.\n\nI have not been teaching HS for very long, but I do not like this book. I am not a textbook dependent teacher, but I do (woefully) recognize that students have poor study skills and don\u0027t reference notes all the time. I do not teach out of the textbook and I spend many hours planning lessons, lecture notes, my own examples, etc. I had many complaints that the problems were confusing, included too many ideas at the same time, etc. Some may be successful in \"teaching themselves\" from the examples, but I am very disappointed that textbooks no longer have TEXT. I may be a math teacher, but I understand the importance of reading and how it helps a person to process the material. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher resources is a great set of worksheets, study masters, note taking guides, etc. Perhaps the authors spent more time on those resources instead of the text.\n",
    "\nThe prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn\u0027t there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn\u0027t bother to read because I just couldn\u0027t torture myself any longer.  And I\u0027m a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I\u0027m certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.\n",

    "\nI liked most of Jo Beverly\u0027s books.  In fact, she is one of my favorite romance writers.  That\u0027s why it\u0027s hard to believe she could write something so boring and contrived.  The premise -- saving an opium addict--- is good.  One could expect a lot of turmoil between the lovers.  But no -- it\u0027s all pretty smooth. The passion is tepid and not much else happens.  A series of \"Rogues\" from previous books is paraded before the reader without really adding to the story.  And the conversations are so boring that I simply had to skip them.  I guess this may be enjoyable to new romance readers who do not know better or hard core Beverly fans\n",
    "\n\nHow the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose\u0027 of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader\u0027s zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people\u0027s plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: \"How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man.\" (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers. \nRiis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, \"If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose.\" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: \"This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities.\"\nHow does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  \"Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man.\" (p. 147). He does not forget that this \"education\" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. \"Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant.\" (p. 270). Riis\u0027 almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  \"It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society.\" (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society.\nAlthough this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm:\nJewtown, Bandit\u0027s Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman\u0027s Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell\u0027s Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer\u0027s Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter\u0027s Field, Blackwell\u0027s Island Asylum, Rogues\u0027 Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.  \nRiis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City: \nChinaman (he can\u0027t be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis\u0027 comments about every race. \nI noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time? \nNot only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man\u0027s greed overrides his concern for human dignity. \n\n\n\n",

Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in \"L\" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.

    "\nThe first book of Auster\u0027s New York trilogy was originally published in 1985, and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel. I\u0027ve never read the original (or any of the other parts of the trilogy), so I can\u0027t comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli\u0027s adaptation. However, I can say that since I\u0027m not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature (those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for Auster\u0027s story), this really didn\u0027t do anything for me at all. The story is basically an exercise in metafiction, and if you like that stuff, great -- I do not. It is dressed up (at least initially) in the mystery genre, but that\u0027s just window dressing. (There\u0027s a long legacy, especially in France, of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings (for example Alain Robbe-Grillet\u0027s two books The Erasers and The Voyeur, or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville.)\n\nThe story begins fairly straightforwardly: a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his own since the death of his wife and son. A complete stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a private detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case. (The writer Paul Auster, and his family, shows up for one scene -- it\u0027s that kind of book.) Quinn meets with the strange man, who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father, who was seeking to discover the true language of God. The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report. Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he\u0027s been following, and his clients. He spends several months watching the building and going crazy. Once he realizes they\u0027ve disappeared, he finds his own life has disappeared as well. Obviously this is all somewhat about identity, but it\u0027s more about fun stuff like language, representation, and other tiresome postmodern subjects (as are the other two parts of the trilogy, which involve a man spying on someone, and yet another disappearance). \n\nIt has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into. The simple, heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material, especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic. However, if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters, this is probably not for you. Fans of Auster may enjoy this, but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen.\n",
    "\nPaul Auster\u0027s City of Glass is perhaps the worst read I\u0027ve experienced.  The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--I kid you not.  The best part of this novel is the end.  I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid; however, I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams.  To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical, existential tour de-force, I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ.  I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind, had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining, dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices, gather such literary praise.  Like a Rorschach image you can see life, love, death, a myriad of wonderful symbols, and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth, intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life, well, then, good for you.  But in reality, the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster, and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it...hook line and sinker. This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere, show us little on the way and still receive praise, despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work, in that it plain and simply: sucks\n",

    "\nI bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects, and given most other people\u0027s ratings, I decided to give it a try.  However, upon opening the book my first thought was, \"these all look like high school yearbook photos\", which is exacltly what they are.  It seems that that\u0027s primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market.  His main concern, which he stresses throughout the book, is creating a \"saleable picture\", and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom, since she\u0027s usually the one with final say over the pictures.  A better title for this book would have been, \"How To Take High School Senior Pictures\".\n\nEven then, most of the pictures are not very good, both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. In addition, the poses are unnatural and awkward looking, and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors.\n\nTo be fair, the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject, but there is really very little useful information here.\n\nSo, if you\u0027re interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait, this may be the book for you.  However, if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner, I\u0027d steer clear of this book\n",
    "\nEhrman\u0027s work is not for a person of faith. It does not take faith into consideration. It is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available - most forged and falsified; and none which can be validated.

I was warned by my minister who is also a Bible scholar and has two Ph.D.\u0027s - and my minister was correct. In Lost Christianities, Ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the New Testament by implying that many New Testament books may be false, forged, translated incorrectly, altered to serve a purpose, etc... Ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the New Testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the New Testament. Ehrman\u0027s Lost Christianities starts out strong, but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader. If for nothing else, it is an attempt to test your faith, but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith. The book leads one to believe that the author is as much a Bible critic as he claims to be a scholar. He does present all sides of the New Testament story and it is interesting how the New Testament was formed. However, the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if Ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does. To save you the time and money, simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the New Testament and how came to be. Ehrman and other Bible critics (ie., The DeVinci Code) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the New Testament story. Save your money and give it to your church instead. \nGary\n",
    "\nI\u0027m a Conan Doyle fan and found The Alienist to be a pretty good read, so I made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside. Carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it. The dialogue is flat, the plot uncompelling and Carr relies on the near-endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement!!! into this tale, which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because I couldn\u0027t bear to read the mangled sentences. This book has no climax -- just, thankfully, an ending. Spend your money on something worth reading.\n",
    "\nI had read all about FSM before picking up this book and bought it as more of a conversation piece.\n\nWell, suffice to say this will never get any space with my other books as it is very poorly put together.\n\nFlimsy cover, flimsy pages, it\u0027s put together about as well as a children\u0027s coloring book.\n\nI too was fooled by the default picture, I thought it was a nice hard cover with a bookmark ribbon like other \"religious\" texts.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.\n\nHey Amazon, change the default picture to the one which shows the book as is, a flimsy cover with a picture of a hard cover on it\n",
    "\nNansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents\u0027 machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin\u0027s excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don\u0027t know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit\n",
    "\nNormally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with \"S\". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn\u0027t get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn\u0027t clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren\u0027t that interesting overall.\n\nI missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here. \nI would vote pass on this one.\n",
    "\nSo, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what\u0027s considered Pynchon\u0027s most imporant work.\n\nImportant 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that\u0027s incredibly clever, I bet it\u0027s, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s worth my time, I didn\u0027t even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.\n\nI\u0027ve read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami\u0027s work that he\u0027s a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don\u0027t agree, Murakami\u0027s ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack\n",
    "\nThis smugly-edited series has become a dreary example of careerist nepotism and features mainly short stories with linebreaks and jokey poems that are not funny. \n\nSome choice awful lines: \n\nDenise Duhamel: \"Don\u0027t give into your cravings, you need to stay lean / So you can lift up your skirt as you prance and twirl...\"\n\nKim Addonizio: \"Better dead then fed. / He who laughs will not last. / Sticks and stones will break you,\"\n\nThomas Lux: \"that the eyes be gouged out / and replaced by hot coals / in the head, _the blockhead_,/ of each countrymen or woman who, / upon reaching their majority, / has yet to read MOBY DICK...\"\n\nMost of the poems herein, besides Franz Wright and Paul Violi among a scattered few, would have been better off as just titles than full poems. The big name poets featured have generally written better poems, the younger poets all seem to have some connection to the New School.

    "\nI thought this book was going to be a great Legal Thriller, but little did I know that it would turn out to be the worst book I have ever read.

The worst Legal Thriller, ever\n",
    "\nFrom about the second page of this book, I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it. The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another. Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys, the women are all \"large-assed\" or fat with the exception of Ella).  And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters\u0027 sexual proclivities was so completely dumb, not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but Tuck\u0027s descriptions are completely banal). \nOh wait, there\u0027s more. The Spanish is ATROCIOUS. It\u0027s hard to believe that Tuck had a translator for this book. It\u0027s pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks Spanish. Half the names are grammatically incorrect. Many of the words are just plain wrong (\"vita\" means life in Italian, not Spanish, for starters). I felt embarrased for the author. Does she know that her book is full of errors?\nThe one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is: SHALLOW. I sincerely hope that readers don\u0027t mistake this book for historical fiction. The author clearly knows little about Paraguay and its people and history, and clearly doesn\u0027t care, from her superficial treatment of it.\n",

Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn\u0027t see how they could be usefully generalized.  Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won\u0027t help much with that.\n\nI think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book.\n",

I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.    \n\nI found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone\u0027s integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?) \n\nIt seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to \"integrity\" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn\u0027t help me much. \n\n",
    "\nYes, it was intended as a \"fun\" read (literature of the absurd?) and it did evoke several chuckles, especially at the first.  But as literature (read into that word what you will) it\u0027s an abysmal failure. Crammed with so many jokes, puns, outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action, one\u0027s interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices. It\u0027s a case where you can\u0027t see the forest for all the intervening trees. \n\nI had expected a \"straight\" tale similar to the Alienist.  Then when I discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural I perked up.  It was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that I grew weary of the whole thing.  Toward the end it descended into caricature.  What\u0027s sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to SNL and the visual media.  In fact, the book seemed very visual, almost as if the author were transcribing a SNL skit\n",

WRONG!\n\nThe whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests. \nI still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.\n\nAs for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn\u0027t care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he\u0027s like a cameo in this book and didn\u0027t have a character development nor adds anything to this book.\n\nIn conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles. \nNevertheless, I\u0027m going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers.\n",

I was surprised at the number of grammatical mistakes and errors.  Clearly little time was spent editing this book.

    "\nby focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard\u0027s book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why. \n\nWhile the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century.  Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u0027s cheap so if you\u0027re not persuaded the research has been effective it won\u0027t cost you much\n",

    "\nPersonally I found this book to be little more than a GRE verbal refresher course.  Sure, it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing.

I was really disappointed in this book\n",

Sure, you\u0027ll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle, but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet, some of the tips on progressing further to \"genetic repair\" will sound a bit too good to be true.\n\nIn fact, most of the advice and recommendations given in the book are not very different from that found in many other books on nutrition and supplement. The authors just gave all the info a \"DNA twist\". I stopped reading the book a few chapters from the end when it begins to talk about hormonal supplementation and some glowing testimonial on the author\u0027s services. All \"natural\"? No side effects? How long have the subjects been followed up and how long have physicians really practised hormonal therapy on otherwise healthy individuals? The results may be real, but how safe is it for the rest of subject\u0027s life?\n\nSounds like another one of those practice-promoting books in this genre. Disappointing\n",
    "\nTo anyone who has or is planning on reading this book, consider this. This book has a lot of words which feel good and can make anyone\u0027s guilty conscience ease in thinking that \"your own will is god\u0027s own will.\" (quoted from Walsh\u0027s books) If you will it, then God wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom, right? Will is a precursor to action. If there is no such this an a \u0027right\u0027 or \u0027wrong\u0027 will, then in essence there is really no such thing as a \u0027right\u0027 or \u0027wrong\u0027 action. If someone else\u0027s actions hurt you, you feel that action is wrong. But the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way, right? It was his will, therefore he was justified and right and god\u0027s right there to back him up. The victim is suffering. Where is his god when he needs him? Was the victim correct in believing the action wrong? Was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right? In this book, god says that WE have the authority to decide what is right or wrong. The action is both right and wrong, right? Wrong. \nThis is when you may want to take a look at the Bible. The Bible portrays God as a loving yet HOLY God. Holy is defined as exalted or worthy of complete devotion as one perfect in goodness and righteousness. He loves us but sees a REAL AND DISTINCT right and wrong as clear as day where sometimes it appears to be a tangled mass to our limited senses. He created us and gave us a conscience which can in most cases discern a right and wrong in a situation. He gave us a free will which allows us to then choose that right or wrong. Are we always going to do the right thing? No, and He knows that. When we do wrong thing, it is unhealthy at best to believe that doing wrong is the right thing to do because we desire it. We\u0027re NOT God. We do wrong all the time and God simply wants us to acknowledge this. He wants us to exercise our FREEWILL to do right according to our conscience and what\u0027s told in His book. But he knows that even still we will do wrong when attempting in good faith to do right. And that is why in a generous act of sacrificing Love He sent His Son Jesus Christ to SHOW us the way, sacrifice Himself on the cross for our wrongs, and be there still today to forgive our wrongs when we believe in Him and in the truly amazing thing He did for us. It\u0027s a beautiful thing! \nI urge you to believe that the Holy Bible is not a lie and Jesus Christ simply did the things the book said He did and is the person He claimed to be. 11 disciples took everything they said and wrote to their grave and never recanted even after much persecution. Wow! \nI\u0027ve been a believer in Christ for almost seven years and He\u0027s continued to worked wonders in my life. I would have been a fan of these books if God had not put me on His path. \nIn case you\u0027re wondering, I gave this book 2 stars because it has reinforced my faith in Christ by giving a glaring example of what God is not. \nIf you\u0027ve read through all of this, thank you. I encourage you to write me. God bless!\n\n",
    "\nMy almost-6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi-pronged approach, including things like supplements, a GFCF diet, and OT/PT/speech. After a year on the GFCF diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors, we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies. \n\nOur close friends\u0027 daughter, now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism, took a similar approach, but even more strict, following the DAN protocol as well as the recommendations of this book, including chelation, a dizzying array of supplements, GFCF diet, OT/PT/Speech, ABA, etc. \n\nWhile our child has made tremenous advances, or friends\u0027 child has not, beyond minor advances related to her age--at 4, she is still non-verbal, far from potty trained, exhibits many repetitive behaviors, and needs constant verbal and visual cues for the simplest tasks. \n\nThe point I am trying to make is that every child is different and no one, NO ONE has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a significant percentage of children with autism. Autism, as most of you likely know well, is a catch-all term. Our friends\u0027 daughter no doubt has a very different kind of pathology than ours. I have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action, rather than immediately launching into predictions of one \"cure\" for a broad range of issues. \n\nWhile I do think some of what the author recommends can be helpful (and it really may offer a tremendous help for some children with autism), some of the therapies (like chelation) can be very dangerous--in fact, I have yet to see one of the many families who tried chelation therapy see *any* improvement in their child\u0027s symptoms. I have seen more success with GFCF diets (for a small percentage of children), but the greatest success seems to come with comprehensive behavioral therapy. \n\nI certainly understand where families are coming from--I have been there myself, but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to \"cure\" them with multiple substances that have had very little study/peer review in a desperate frenzy of worry is both dangerous to their bodies and destructive to their emotions. As with anything, balance is your approach will serve you and your child well.\n",

    "\nI\u0027m perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read \"Grapes of Wrath\" or \"East of Eden.\"  Instead I have focused on \"Of Mice and Men\" and his lesser known works, such as \"To a God Unknown\" and, my personal favorite, \"Pastures of Heaven.\"  I\u0027ve been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.\n\nWhen I began reading \"In Dubious Battle,\" it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck\u0027s work.  Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac\u0027s radical cell.  There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers.  Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.\n\nSuddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he\u0027s going to pick up the pace again.  After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker\u0027s strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue.  It simply never does.\n\nSummary of \"In Dubious Battle\" - Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.\n\nThe rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking.  And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book.  Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense...\n\n...and eating.  Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food.  There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.\n\nSteinbeck\u0027s sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters.  But I advise any reader of \"In Dubious Battle\" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down.  You won\u0027t miss anything.  Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.\n\nI suppose now I\u0027ll give \"Grapes of Wrath\" a go.  Perhaps if it isn\u0027t one of his \"greats,\" it isn\u0027t worth reading\n",
    "\nThis is the sort of book you get when an author writes on a subject with which he has only a passing familiarity, and lacks the confidence that the subject matter is inherently interesting enough to hold the reader\u0027s attention.  The result is a book that is ultimately unsatisfying.\n\nOne symptom of the problems described above is that large portions are devoted to subjects other than money.  For example, the author uses the first three pages after the introduction to describe Aztec ritual sacrifice in literally gory detail before proceeding on to the use of cocao beans as commodity money.  I think that\u0027s meant to be what they used to call in show business a \"grabber,\" but for the reader expecting to learn about money, it\u0027s a distraction. Another problem is that the author\u0027s grasp of modern economics is shaky at best, and especially in the latter part of the book, he\u0027ll make a point and then repeat himself, much as an undergraduate trying to extend the length of a term paper that\u0027s run a few pages short.\n\nAnd yet, there\u0027s also some interesting and oddly convincing tidbits of information here. The author states that L. Frank Baum\u0027s 1900 book \"The Wizard of Oz\" is really a parable about the need for a bimetallic dollar based on both gold and silver.  But even as it strikes you that this is an interesting bit of trivia, you realize that it\u0027s only a bit of trivia and has little larger significance.\n\nIf you\u0027re looking for a economic history of money, you should look elsewhere.  If you\u0027re interested in the cultural and sociological impact of money, this may be more to your liking, though I think it still falls short.\n\n \n",
    "\nWhen I traveled in Japan with a friend, this was the book we brought with us.  Within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in Tokyo looking for a better one.  There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country, and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable.  \n\nHowever, the book has a very negative, immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general.  It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade.  Did I pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans?  The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites, ancient and modern, that borders on the anti-intellectual.  The cultural notes are dated, inaccurate, and shallow.  After a while, we began to think, \"If Lonely Planet doesn\u0027t recommend it, it\u0027s probably interesting.\"  The maps, as many have mentioned, are almost useless.  Ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path, it\u0027s practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas. \n\nThere are much better guides available.

Plus, I don\u0027t buy the \"only people who aren\u0027t well-read don\u0027t like it\" argument. I\u0027ve read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book\n",
    "\nI usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I\u0027ve read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what \"Insomnia\" is. This isn\u0027t a spoiler, just the author\u0027s note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.\n\nThe other King books I\u0027ve read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  \"Insomnia\u0027s\" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn\u0027t come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn\u0027t usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph\u0027s numerous confidantes.\n\nThen there\u0027s the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.  \n\nI gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer\u0027s arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, \u0027How is King going to get through this?\u0027 His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert\u0027s narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.\n\nOne last thing, the villians just don\u0027t work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there\u0027s the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.              \n",

That was a mistake, the character\u0027s were two dimensional and truly unbelieveable.

He would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows.  I didn\u0027t even read the second story, maybe I\u0027ll come back to that.  The third story was totally ridiculous as well.  Paris is so sick of Russell - he doesn\u0027t have a job, money and no ambition, yet she stays with him.  He cheats on her, she has the broads up in her house and sells them Mary Kay!!  Yet she stays with him.  He has given her an STD!!!  She stays with him!!!  She doesn\u0027t even like making love to him.  During all of this nonsense her fi-one boss is pushing up on her, and she resists.  She won\u0027t cheat on her man.  What!!!!

His supposed \"back-stories\" which should be really interesting, all seem like a recap of the mini segments during the Tour broadcast that let you know more about the participants.\n\nThere is just nothing that reaches out and grabs you, and makes you want to keep reading.

    "\nHow some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me.  First of all, I\u0027d just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first! Secondly, if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it! This book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section.  Horrible! So basically, this INTRODUCTION to electronics doesn\u0027t do a lot of introducing you to anything! I\u0027m on transistors right now, and I\u0027ve spent days researching the physics of how they work on the Internet, and guess what? It\u0027s using schematics I don\u0027t understand, and yet again I\u0027m going to have to do more looking on the net.  This book is not worth it.  Don\u0027t buy it! Just please, for your own sake, find another one.  Also, half the book is dedicated to projects.  That is, actually building electronic circuits! Why didn\u0027t the author just entitle this, \"How to build electronic devices\", then? It\u0027s beyond me! As far as explaining things are concerned, the book does very little, and assume you know more than you do.  Unfortunately I\u0027m going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook, because this one is just horrible.

    "\nThis is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read \"Desperation\" and \"Insomnia\" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.\n\nI thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of \"The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I\u0027ll read my junk mail.\n\nI cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery\n",

They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They don\u0027t know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101.

    "\nLike most critics of Objectivism, Mr. Walker focuses his criticism on Ayn Rand\u0027s frailties and idiosyncrasies rather than the principles of the philosophy she founded.  My disappointment in his book was immediate and I have to say it\u0027s as unoriginal a piece of writing as any other critic I\u0027ve read.  His cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things Objectivism is obvious to anyone who takes ideas seriously.  I cannot recommend this book even to those interested in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy; this book was written for those of like mind to the author...whatever mind they can be said to have.\n\nThe body and scope of work done by Objectivist scholars who\u0027ve never met Ayn Rand now ellipses her work - both fiction and non-fiction - and the work of her original core of thinkers.  To characterize the movement as a cult may have had some validity in the years prior to her death, but only in the most remote sense of the word.  Right now the ranks of Objectivism are swelling with intelligent people who differ in background AND in opinion.  Mr. Walker\u0027s principle mistake is looking at Objectivism as something that was born exclusively from the mind of Ayn Rand...something Miss Rand herself would disagree with.  Objectivism is the logical continuation of a line of thought that views mankind as a reasoning animal...a line that extends back through history and begins (explicitly) with Aristotle.  Those (like Mr. Walker) who dismiss it on the basis of Miss Rand\u0027s personality and the culture of people that grew around her in her lifetime are truly missing an opportunity to enlighten themselves.  \n\nThere is no doubt Ayn Rand is a polarizing figure; my advice to those inclined to read Mr. Walker\u0027s book is to read Miss Rand\u0027s books as well.  Particularly her non-fiction.  I\u0027m not a real big fan of her novels or fiction in general - it was Rand\u0027s non-fiction works that first inspired me to study her philosophy - so my first suggestion would be \"Philosophy: Who Needs It.\"  I enjoyed her novels, but I enjoyed her non-fiction more\n",

    "\nThis is a very famous and a very influential book. This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer\u0027s book. What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. This is not a book supported by research. It is a book of stories. The stories, one after the other, are about Kramer\u0027s patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. Consider these four examples.\n1. Sam: \"Sam not only recovered from his depression, he declared himself better than well. He felt unencumbered, more vitally alive, less pessimistic. Now he could complete projects in one draft, whereas before he sketched and sketched again. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. Every aspect of his work went more smoothly. He appeared more poised, more thoughtful, less distracted. He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.)\n2. Sally: After four months on Prozac, she looked brighter, calmer, self-assured, in control of herself. The most important effect of the medication, Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. She started going to dances...(Page 147.)\n3. William M: The patient\u0027s low self-esteem, which had been present since his earliest childhood, began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before. (Page 203.)\n4. Ms. B: For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...Off Prozac, Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men. Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings.\nDozens of other examples could be cited. The point is, this is essentially the book. It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these. What is disturbing is that I now know the truth. Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically. They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness, anxiety, depression, and a bad temper has increased dramatically. We have come to believe, as Kramer puts it, \"biology is destiny\" (page xiv). No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long. No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is. The dangers of long-term use (diabetes, Parkinson\u0027s disease, permanent muscle jerking, etc.) are never discussed. (Of course, these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote.) See Timothy Scott\u0027s wonderful, and unlike Kramer\u0027s book, carefully documented book America Fooled: The Truth About Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and How We\u0027ve Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health. Yes, this book has been influential. Thus, Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants. (They do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies.) It\u0027s funny how, as our knowledge grows, a great book beomes a harmful book, but it is just that.   \n",

About the only thing it has in common with  Microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry. \n\njPod is set in a landscape of unreality, with no apparent reason than to make a series of whacky adventures for eccentric, and for the most part unlikeable, characters. It certainly doesnt reflect the IT industry of today, and the members of the jPod really only seem to represent those aspects of this community which give programmers a bad reputation, as essentially dysfunctional (autistic) as they are. There doesnt even seem to be any real focus for this story. I felt like I was mostly reading about a heap of stuff that \u0027happened\u0027.\n\nIts not all bad, and there were more than a few humorous moments, and interesting plot twists. Coupland\u0027s highly approachable and fast moving writing style hasn\u0027t changed. Its really just the subject matter and whatever its trying to communicate that seems to have fallen in a heap, in this book. I normally devour all of his books within a day or two, and want to read them again soon after, but it was a real struggle just to get through this one to the end\n",
    "\nThen you\u0027ll probably like this story.  \n\nMy wife and I read books together and I\u0027d sworn off Cornwell after Hornet\u0027s Nest (which on TV Cornwell admitted was some warmed over college material - and it showed horribly).  The Scarpetta character (in some books) is unbelievably emotionally ultra-hyper (going from confident to terrified every time Marino knocks on the door).  \n\nIn this book she was mercifully level headed almost ALL the time!  What a relief.  And there was a real story.  I\u0027m not really a fan of her work over the last 10 years but there\u0027s almost enough lab details here to satisfy.  Sure wish she (Scarpetta) would learn to delegate - imagine the top lab expert for her state and she has to go to every crime scene and move bodies herself!  \n\nAnyway don\u0027t start here with the Scarpetta series - but if you already like the character, this one is a B+.  Compared to other crime novels in general, it\u0027s still a C- in my estimation\n",
    "\nThis book is atrocious.  It is THE worst book I have read in the last decade.  A 10 year old could have done better.

The only plus was that I got it out of the library and didn\u0027t pay for it\n",
    "\nWhy are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book?  Honestly, what has this author contributed to the world with this book?  Was it the characters?  No, they\u0027ve all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years (i.e. cocky and handsome FBI agent, beautiful but dangerous killer with a past, take-no-sh#t FBI boss, etc.).  Was it the deep insight into the characters themselves?  A laugh out loud, \"No!\".  There was nothing coming close to character development.  Was there some new and clever writing style?  Unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary (I call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel).  How about the plot?  Was that something worth my time?  Not unless you haven\u0027t ever watched suspence movie in your life.  \n\nSo honestly, what the hell makes this book worth anyone\u0027s time?  All I can find in this book are two dimensional characters, needless sub-plots, ludicris dialogue, and empty promises (we\u0027re lied to about the main character\u0027s fate in the beginning and we\u0027re lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of Hitchcock).  \n\nAs a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape Hollywood\u0027s onslaught of needless, pointless, and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage I can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money.  \n\nThis man does not deserve our money and certainly does not deserve to write anything other than an apology letter to the world for dumbing us down into thinking that this type of writing is anything other than trash\n",
    "\nMy friend\u0027s and I will pass books back and forth to each other to read if they are good. My friend was going to throw this one out instead of passing it along, but since I have a dog, I thought it would be interesting, but it wasn\u0027t, so I had the honor of throwing it out myself. \n\nTypically, I would donate the book or give it to charity, but I don\u0027t think anyone would enjoy it. It\u0027s just this author\u0027s drivel.

    "\nThis book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that\u0027s all she wrote, folks. There\u0027s no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what\u0027s the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It\u0027s ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don\u0027t think the author\u0027s care at this point (seeing how many millions they\u0027ve made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you\u0027ll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing).

In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I\u0027ll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong\n",
    "\n\u0026#65279;Millennials Rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, focusing this time on the generation born after X.\n\nFor those not already familiar with the authors\u0027 theory, Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991. They wrote the book Generations, which introduced a theory that generations fall into four re-cycling types, and each type comes of age during a different kind of era, or \"turning\". The Silent Generation is of the \"adaptive\" type, for instance, passive, gentle, and in tune with their emotions, and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America. The Baby Boomers, remembered for their \"Awakening\" in the 1960s, are of the \"idealist\" type, concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in, but inclined to change during life (from hippie to the current \"Just say no\" control freak). Generation X, which they named the Thirteenth Generation, is of the \"reactive\" type, being alienated, street-smart and materialistic, without a feeling of need to be \"loyal\" to anything, coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s. They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the \"Millennial Generation\", and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut, just like the G.I. Generation that fought World War II, going back to the \"civic\" type generation before the Silent Generation. In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen, which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are. In their third book, The Fourth Turning, they went back to the whole theory and writing about all the generations. They also changed the archetype names from adaptive, idealist, reactive and civic to Artist, Prophet, Nomad and Hero. Strauss and Howe wrote in this book about an upcoming era of epic battle and mass destruction, much like the one in which the G.I. Generation came of age. They then predicted the Millennial Generation would form the role of Heroes during the coming crisis, and they would lower teen pregnancy rates, stop using drugs, serve the United States, in uniform even, and desist with using profanity.\n\nSo then in 2000 they put out this book, Millennials Rising. In this one the authors try to explain the Millennial Generation (my generation). Millennials Rising attempts to identify who we, the most ethnically diverse generation in American history as they note, are. In Millennials Rising they write about this generation\u0027s Boomer parents and their influence on the Millennial Generation, as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up (which S\u0026H think of as hundreds of television channels, SUV lifestyles, rappers who swear, and people who smack each other on TV). The book states that Millennials want to work together in teams, believe the people in authority know more about right and wrong than they do, are enthusiastic about learning and going to school, are loved and protected by their parents, achieve great things in school and will achieve great things in the future, and lest we forget, always want to exude that \"positive peer pressure\" on their fellow Millennials.\n\nThe obviously leads to the question, then, is the generation really optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut just as they say? Consider this: Only 28% of high school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is \"meaningful\", only 21% describe their courses as \"interesting\" and still barely over a third, 39%, believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life. The generation was supposed to be enthusiastic about learning. The Millennial Generation also rapidly increased drug use, especially pot, from the level at which Generation X was using them in its teens, as even the authors themselves note.\n\nS\u0026H portray the world of edgy entertainment, such as television shows, movies and music, as a Zoroastrian battle. In popular music, for instance, artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged Millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side, artists like Eminem, Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson, on the other, boy bands and Britney Spears and her imitators, along with such second-tier bands as the S Club 7. They do not deal with the Millennial interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two. For instance, Blink-182 is just about the biggest band around now, and yet Millennials Rising does not mention Blink-182 and the many young fans who make the band a success. South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut is the authors\u0027 idea of where popular culture is today. Millennials Rising heralds boy bands as what music will increasingly be like as the current decade unfolds, and blasts the \"edgy\" bands as groups that will be washed away, but could the authors have predicted bands like Good Charlotte or artists like Avril Lavigne?\n\nThis leads to the bigger question of whether the book and the theory will be able to predict anything. S\u0026H write about \"rebelling by being better\" during the present decade. Apparently, their idea of rebellion is not listening to Limp Bizkit, blasting censorship, or doing illegal drugs, but wearing preppy clothes, waiting until marriage to have sex, and trusting their government. According to them, we should expect to see Millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their own peers. S\u0026H write that we will accept the draft and join the military in great numbers when the crisis presents us with a war, and even do National Service. Frankly, can anyone imagine any more than 20% of today\u0027s high school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of America? Also, our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following Bush as leader during the Iraq War, while S\u0026H predict Millennials serving their president. How suited to a Hero generation is that? The G.I. Generation followed FDR so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in Braille. When it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis, Millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would. This, of course, does not have to be a bad thing, but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the predictive abilities of the theory.\n\nSome parts of it make for very interesting reading, but all the talk about how they are to be the \"next great\" generation gets to you sometimes. S\u0026H seem to believe you can never think too big about those Millennials. Millennials Rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers, but sometimes what the book describes just isn\u0027t happening\n",
    "\nIt certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge-based workers are the future in American Society.

    "\nThis fourth installment of Becky\u0027s trying tribulations is the worst. The qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment.

    "\nThis is a revolutionary book. It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. It\u0027s questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it\u0027s bane as an introduction).\n\nHowever, the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.\n\n(The following is a charicature of the author\u0027s argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, \"All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify\" (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)\n\nThere are other arguments, obviously, and the statement \"we can draw a parallel with other situations\" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? My answer: No. Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a \"reality\".\n\nI hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. Where the author goes outside of common sense, he\u0027s wrong, sometimes plainly so. This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. Where \"evidence\" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. In short, this isnt a scientific study at all. \n\nMy final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction \"A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants\" (15). This is a curios definition. Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. He didnt. He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.\n\nSo an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. Why wont this subject go away? This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings\n",
    "\nRobin Williams used to tell a joke about his son, saying that whenever he got angry with him his son would say \u0027you hit me and I\u0027ll write a book.\u0027 I\u0027d like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind Peggy Salinger\u0027s memior about life with her father, but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea. Although there are some interesting revelations about Salinger as a man, his daughter doesn\u0027t seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of JD Salinger, they\u0027re the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday. There\u0027s a lot of blame thrown around here, and not a whole lot of admitting to one\u0027s own mistakes. Although this is probably to be expected, it\u0027s still frustrating, since Margaret Salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her father\u0027s good name, and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical. (Complaining about your father\u0027s desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea.) I admit that her father is probably not as nice a guy as you think he would be, but this is not really a revelation, nor should it affect your feelings about his work.

    "\nThe book isn\u0027t good at all. I\u0027m sorry. I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies (Hell House included) I was really excited to read this. I have heard many complaints about the book from calling it \"soft porn\" to \"sick soft porn\" and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale. Sacrilege in a book called...Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up. Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary. I doubt these were Mathis\u0027 \"sexual fantasies\" in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying. It is an effective way to convey horror to a reader. Similar to enacting horrible violence on children, or worse, babies in cinema (try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face). Mathis should not be condemned for content.\n\nHere is what he did right. He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science. Much like I am Legend used science to define its vampires, Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and believable within the framework of the story.\n\nThe bad parts may be more numerous. His characterization is horrid. There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them. You will remember Barrett by his limp, Fishcer by his fear, Florence by her religious beliefs, and Edith...well because there is no one else. They are paper thin and have no real motivations. The pacing seems poor too. A lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you, the reader. As a matter of fact the revelations themselves, when all is said and done, are really pretty dull. There is also a habit characters have, when going into great lengths of exposition that goes on for pages, to cup their hands around a coffee cup. It seems too much like a commercial for me! Anyway, the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very few vivid descriptions in the book. Sometimes I wanted to know what things looked like, I wanted imagery not just exposition for pages. What was it about the atmosphere that, say Fischer found so scary? We needed the scenes to be better developed. By the end I was so tired of lines like:\n\n\"God do you know what this means?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I can\u0027t tell you now but it\u0027s freakin\u0027 awesome!\"\n\nThat exchange is not in the book but you will find many similar moments throughout. Just tell us already! The fear should come through our attachment to the characters not the mystery of the house because the mystery of the house is kind of weak. This book is not worth it, unfortunately. I hate to say it because I Am Legend is really good (though it did suffer from some of the same things I pointed out above, though on a smaller level). It\u0027s the classic \"show don\u0027t tell\" advice\n",

    "\n\"A Dirty Job\" was my first Christopher Moore novel, and will probably be my last.  I was captivated by the story line as I read the dust jacket, but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting.  I thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest, and very little addressing the actual theme of the book.  Although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book\u0027s hero, I just wasn\u0027t drawn in enough to care about him.  The action began in the final quarter of the book, and you had better suspend reality before reading it.  I actually couldn\u0027t wait for the book to end so I could move on to something more interesting\n",

    "\nThe word Atlas is misleading as there is alot of text accompanying the various maps. Some pages are nothing but text. I expect an Atlas to use maps to explain more rather than words. The maps that are in the book are good, but numerous sections do not have one.\n\nThe book is split into sections/topics written by individual persons. However, in many sections the text ends in mid-sentence, as if several pages were forgotten about in each section or as if there was some arbitrary cutoff on the # of words per section.\n\nof this approx 200 page book, sentence cutoffs appear on these pages.

    "\nSadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner \"We\u0027re Here,\" which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O\u0027Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, \"Honey, I see what you mean.\"   One can get the general gist, but it\u0027s best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.  \n\n\tFor example, when educated Harvey says, \"Why can\u0027t we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?\" his pal Dan answers, \"Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, \u0027u\u0027d scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin\u0027 ain\u0027t reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we\u0027ll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain\u0027t it?\"\n\n\tI got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce\u0027s \"Ulysses\" than an unannotated version of this book. \n\n\tSo why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!

    "\nI would not personally recommend this book to horror/thriller fans.  I would definitely not recommend this book for anyone under 18!  If you like soap operas, you may enjoy this book a lot.  If you are searching for the secrets of Rose Red or a good ghost story, this is not your book.\n\nI read the story before the author was made known.  I thought it might be Stephen King or Tabitha King.  The writing style was far below Stephen King\u0027s style and it was very erotic, which I suspected Tabitha King to be the author.  However, the accounts of Ellen were obviously written by a man, as the erotic episodes were definitely not from the viewpoint of a woman.  So, it was no surprise when the author was neither Stephen nor Tabitha, but a male author I have never heard of.\n\nThe book reveals almost nothing new about Rose Red and it\u0027s secrets.  I would dare say that 90% of the diary goes on and on about Ellen and John\u0027s wealth and extremely dysfunctional marriage.  On and on about John\u0027s extramarital affairs, Ellen\u0027s withholding of sexual favors, more affairs, more withholding of favors, more affairs, more favors withheld.  The story is a vicious circle regarding this.  It\u0027s almost like she gets burned, but yet continues to play with fire.  Very frustrating and almost boring, as you read the same scenarios redundantly.  By the third time, you know exactly what he\u0027s doing and how she will retaliate.  Silly.\n\nI mentioned above that the Diary of Ellem Rimbauer revealed no new secrets of the house.  In fact, as the diary progresses, it skips four occurrences (it made mention of the four, like \"by the way, four disappearances happened since last time I wrote, but I won\u0027t tell you about them\").  And this I found obnoxious - ***SPOILER ALERT***  Ellen waits some three or so years for a sance from a master uber-psychic.  Three long years.  But after the sance, nothing is revealed!   The book is riddled with episodes like this.  Some big secret is coming.  When it finally is revealed, it\u0027s no secret at all.  It\u0027s something dumb, like \"yes, there are spirits in the house\".  What spirits?  Why?  Who?  Nothing is ever satisfactorily explained.\n\nI would have given it one star, however it seemed to have a single quality.  At the start of the diary, Ellen was an ordinary 19 year old fiance to John.  Soon, she is corrupted by John, wealth, maybe corrupted by her African best friend (jury is still out), and hatred.  She prays to God, but also to \"her other god\" (the dark one).  At first, you suppose she is playing with fire.  Right on.  She gets consumed by darkness, revenge, and hatred and falls into self destruction.  \n\nOverall, I personally thought it read like fan fiction.  I would bet the author whipped up this short story just for giggles, but somehow it got published.  I was disappointed, hoping for a good ghost story.  But I ended up reading a soft-porn, soap opera style plot.\n\nHope I don\u0027t offend those who loved the book :\n",

    "\nThe very first thing you read in this book is a mistake.  The Prologue begins with a photo of German POWs at the end of WWI.  The photo caption states that the German Army at the end of WWI was \"unbroken\" and implies that Germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership.  This is doubly misleading.  The German Army was soundly defeated on Western Front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate.  In 1918, Germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by Ludendorff and Hindenberg.  The political leaders who lost will were the German High Command.  Defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army.  Keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious \"stab in the back\" myth used by the German military and right wing propagandists to undermine the Weimar republic.  Its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters.  \nThis type of error recurs throughout this book.  My favorite relatively minor error is Keegan moving the Ploesti oilfields, a major strategic resource, from Romania to Hungary.  See prior reader reviews for documentation of a number of factual errors of varying magnitude.  Just as important and in some cases even more important are Keegan\u0027s failures to discuss crucial aspects of WWII.  He makes little effort, for example, to discuss the origins of the war.  Indeed, his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss.  Leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this crucial topic, there are excellent overviews of 20s and 30s that are good guides to this admittedly formidable topic.  Instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war, we get a superficial and somewhat misleading discussion of how industrialization transformed military technology and organization.  Instead of a discussion of the sad history of the Weimar Republic, crucial for understanding the ascent of the Nazis, we get another misleading discussion of the Freikorps phenomenon.  Among other significant omissions are his failure to grapple with the possible strategic significance of the Allied bombing campaign against Germany, a issue analyzed insightfully by Richard Overy in 2 of his excellent books.  Keegan\u0027s discussion of the Holocaust in both inadequate and implicitly misleading.  Partly because he doesn\u0027t discuss the origins of the war and the role played by Nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in crucial respects the Holocaust was the point of German aggression.  The Nazis went to war not just to overturn the Versailles settlement or even to conquer Eastern Europe, but to impose their bizarre notions of racial conflict on the rest of Europe.  Without this background, its impossible to understand the outbreak and the specific nature of WWII.  Among other things, Nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the western Soviet Union, a factor in their eventual defeat.  As pointed out by other reviewers, Keegan devotes a disproportionate amount of the book to activities of the Western allies when the Eastern front was really the crucial theatre.  \nTo be fair to Keegan, writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very difficult.  The best 1 volume work on WWII is Gerhard Weinberg\u0027s book, which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly small font.  Some of the individual sections of this book are quite good and Keegan has a nice, sometimes actually elegant, writing style.  None of these positive features, however, can overcome his neglect of basic features of WWII and the lack of attention to basic facts.  This is not just error, this is actual negligence.  \n",

    "\nThe number of books written in our society is huge and getting huger. Everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read. Why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market? One reason, apparently embraced by the Goldstones, is that it is so EASY to write a book! All you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences. They don\u0027t have to be particularly interesting experiences. You don\u0027t have to do any research into your subject. If you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing, if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took, if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers (even if they are not interesting or witty), and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in, you can finish the book in a couple of weekends! And readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done.\n\nThe book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors, and I recognized some of my own experiences in the stories the authors tell. However, the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over common early errors, nor does it attempt to answer many of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting. What determines the price of old books? Why are first editions important? Why should Tarzan books cost more than great works of literature? These are good questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting, and you will find the questions but not the answers here.\n\nThe book is written in a breezy style that is easy to get through, and if you have two hours at an airport to kill, you could do worse than to read it. But by the time you arrive at your destination, you will have likely forgotten most of what you just read, because so much of it is ephemeral details of the authors\u0027 own lives, transportation problems, and experiences. If you are really interested in book collecting, it would be wise to read one of the many books that describe what one should look for, how prices are determined, different styles of book collecting, and so on. Fragments of this knowledge are transmitted in this book, but they will leave you with more questions than answers.\n\nTo be sure, not every book about book collecting needs to be a font of wisdom. But the entertainment value of the authors\u0027 experiences was weak, and did not make up for the absence of useful content\n",

Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.\n\nWhat a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, \u0027padded\u0027.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages. \n\nDickens\u0027 work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of \u0027The Old Curiosity Shop\u0027, \"I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing.\"  \u0027OMF\u0027 goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence. \n\nEven worse is the ending.  Some endings just can\u0027t help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.\n\nAll of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for \"The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens\" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens\u0027 oeuvre or are required to read \"Our Mutual Friend\", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens\u0027 far superior works:  \u0027David Copperfield\u0027, \u0027Oliver Twist\u0027, \u0027Pickwick Papers\u0027.  \n\nIf you are looking for \u0027LOST\u0027 reading material, I would refer you to \u0027Watership Down\u0027 (Excellent), \u0027The Stand\u0027 (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), \u0027The Dark Tower\u0027 series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to \u0027Our Mutual Friend\u0027 possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like \u0027Locke, Rousseau and Hume\u0027.\n\nNamaste and Good Luck,\nAKA Redemption Isle on TheFuselage.co\n",

    "\nThis book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science: write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content, and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible. What a bunch of baloney. \n\nFirst of all, evolution, in the sense of \"common descent,\" is not impossible. Even ID-iot superstars Michael Behe, Stephen Meyer, and Jonathan Wells have admitted as much. (See a summary of their recent testimony in the Kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution/creationism forum at the West Virginia Gazette. (wvgazettemail) (put \"/forums\" after com) So any ID-iot who thinks all that bafflegab about irreducible complexity (IC) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply ignorant.  Man evolved from non-human ancestors. Get over it. \n\nThaxton in particular ought to read that summary, since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly ID-iotic.  \n\nIn any case, the empirical data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab. Talking about the allegedly empirical foundation for intelligent design makes it sound deliciously scientific, especially to poorly educated ID-iots, who generally are clueless about real science; but even if the empirical data is accurate, it\u0027s nothing but a facade, because it has nothing to do with the book\u0027s main conclusion. \n\nFor example, imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play Beethoven concertos on the piano. Skeptical, you ask for proof. \"Simple,\" your neighbor replies. \"See, here\u0027s my dog, and there\u0027s my piano.\" Only a moron would accept that as \"proof,\" and yet ID-iot Christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of \"proof\" from ID-iotic films like this. \n\nThe problem with your neighbor\u0027s \"proof\" is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano.  Neither of those issues, however, was the real cause of your skepticism, so the \"proof\" was entirely meaningless. The critical issue, of course, was not the mere existence of the dog and the piano, but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano, and your neighbor\u0027s \"proof\" was completely silent on that issue. Again, only a moron would accept evidence of mere existence as proof of piano-playing ability. \n\nIn this book, there\u0027s a lot of talk about how complex certain biological systems are.  That is nothing but meaningless bafflegab, because the mere existence of complex systems is not a disputed issue. The disputed issue is how those systems came into being, and on that issue the book\u0027s \"evidence\" is completely silent. \n\nThis book was designed to fool poorly educated, easily impressed ID-iots.  Judging from the five-star reviews, it seems to have succeeded.  Well, there\u0027s a sucker born every minute, and apparently a lot of them are found in evangelical churches and seminaries.  In one of the very first evolution debates, Thomas Huxley accused Bishop Wilberforce of using his intellectual and oratorical gifts to mislead and bamboozle people.  Things haven\u0027t changed much since then. \n\nInstead of meaningful evidence, this book substitutes a God-of-the-gaps argument. \"Gee, look how complex it is. It must have been created by an intelligent designer. Maybe, just maybe, it was God. Wink, wink.\" \n\nGod-of-the-gaps arguments are dumb. Only ignorant suckers are taken in by them. So if any of those folks who wrote five-star reviews for this book would like to buy a nice bridge in Brooklyn or a dog who can play Beethoven concertos on the piano, please give me a call.  I\u0027ll be happy to provide evidence!\n",

    "\nA writer for the Irish Echo said this book should have been titled \"The Protocols of the Elders of Erin.\"  It was written around the time Al Smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist, anti-Catholic prejudices of upstate New York and America at that time.  While there really were gangs in that era, most of New York\u0027s immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like St. Vincent\u0027s, Fordham, St. John\u0027s, Manhattan and Manhattanville.  The vast majority of the city\u0027s population including its immigrants didn\u0027t riot in 1863.  In fact New York City\u0027s 200,000 soldiers and sailors, more than half of whom were immigrants, won over 100+ Medals of Honor during America\u0027s Civil War.   \n\nIt\u0027s a tribute to the persistence of prejudice that this book isn\u0027t more widely recognized as the nasty practical joke that it is\n",

    "\n\nIn the post 9/11 world in which this book, subtitled \"The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East\" was published, it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day. This, however, is not to be found in What Went Wrong?\n\nInstead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae. We learn, for instance, that, \"A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony, by harmony or counterpoint. This begins in its simplest form with the choir, in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument, matching the ten fingers of the two hands, following different routes in a common purpose; and finally, the musical ensemble, from duets and trios to the full orchestra\". While this is all well and good, and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level, it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of \"The Clash Between Islam and Modernity...\" that has led to the precarious times in which we live.\n\nOr, on another note (harmony? counterpoint?) we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850\u0027s. Big deal!\n\nWhat we don\u0027t learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism. There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity. The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index, nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb, or his writing of the incendiary manifesto, Milestones. Furthermore, there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda, though Usama bin Laden does appear, albeit seemingly as an afterthought, in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nBeats me..\n",
    "\nThis is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child\u0027s behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn\u0027t finish this. It is drivel\n",

Alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters.\n\nCareful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant Oriental women, it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born.  Hence the seven(7) percent utilization of this water in that part of the world.  \n\nElsewhere, mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the Japanese organizations which promote alkaline water.\n\nCommon sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake, then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral pH liquid is the answer.  \n\nAlkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood pH with  high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put  you in the emergency room as my medic(1985 Nobel Prize recipient) clearly points out.\n\nYou might as well drink battery acid he said, the result will be the same stress on your blood pH.  Here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood pH.\n\nHe continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system, the very low pH which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly.  The various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers.\n\nThe alkaline promoters, including this book\u0027s author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with  even the very basics of body chemistry and metabolic processes.\n\nRead the book for entertainment and not for education and utility in your daily nutritional program\n",

    "\nI have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books, so this is drastic!  Spoilers ahead - please don\u0027t read on if you haven\u0027t read the book.  I managed to (somehow) get through the first book, \u0027Wideacre\u0027, which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory\u0027s novels, so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book, the sequel as I\u0027d bought it and it looked more promising.  It was \u0027marginally better\u0027 as one reader put it, than the first, but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.\n\nI was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted, Julia\u0027s consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.  I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!  Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.  I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didn\u0027t marry him... ah, because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say, aha!  She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although it\u0027s not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.\n\nThe rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that, in fact, for anyone at all.  I don\u0027t want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much, but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.  This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right.  Clean slate, so to speak.  Yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks James to find the child?!  What?!  And I was expecting perhaps a deformed child, after all this inbreeding (I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister AND grandparents who are brother and sister!!!) but she was perfect and beautiful.  I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she\u0027d never be found again.. but alas, the Lacey madness will live on...\n\nThe perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist.  Gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia\u0027s era had by Richard being killed by Ralph, then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or (this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a little, didn\u0027t you?  he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in Austen\u0027s books) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia\u0027s was not intentional nor her fault (I was practically screaming at her that it wasn\u0027t her fault - and she gets it in the end, when it\u0027s too late!) and they marry and have \u0027normal\u0027 children - or perhaps none, they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other, and make a fresh start for Wideacre.\n\nThere were so many allies that Julia had - she was a sweet girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though, I got so mad.  So many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh... SO frustrating.  I will not be reading the third book in the series.  I shall go back to reading Gregory\u0027s more historic novels (A Constant Princess is one I haven\u0027t read yet and it sounds excellent).  I wouldn\u0027t recommend this one\n",
    "\nChromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?\n\nRobin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.\n\nChromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook\u0027s name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook\u0027s novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That\u0027s it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don\u0027t think so.\n\n",
    "\nWell, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.  \n\nThe story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter\u0027s mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna\u0027s body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter\u0027s death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna\u0027s death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer. \n\n\tMillhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna\u0027s day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna\u0027s family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna. \n\t\nNot being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn\u0027t know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you\u0027re a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton\u0027s alphabet themed novels besides this one\n",

I wouldn\u0027t go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as \u0026quot;hopeless\u0026quot;, but it\u0027s certainly superficial: Postman seems to rely on secondary sources about Enlightenment thought, rather than any deep reading of Enlightenment texts.  The idea of \u0026quot;building a bridge to the 18th century\u0026quot; seems more like a marketing device, a fresh way of presenting some of Postman\u0027s familiar themes, than a serious proposition (He even includes a summary of his \u0026quot;disappearance of childhood\u0026quot; argument in an appendix).  It\u0027s a shame, really, because the Enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long, and Postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what\u0027s good and admirable about contemporary society to Enlightened thinking.  For a much more substantial survey and defence of Enlightenment thought and culture, read Roy Porter\u0027s _The Creation of the Modern World: The British Enlightenment_\n",

    "\nThis book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don\u0027t mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn\u0027t have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked. \nBesides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed.\nThis is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide\n",

Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. \n\nI get the impression the author intended to write a Freakonomics-type book, but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material (located at the end of the book). Facing an irate publisher, he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old Economics lecture notes. As a result, readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive, while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use. (Despite the glowing accolades on the cover, the author\u0027s explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)\n\nThe author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon, but does not provide any answers. Aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students, such tactics are unconscionable. Of course, the author may be priming the pump for sales of a \"Hidden Order Supplement\".\n\nA final negative point is the author\u0027s tone, which is frequently condescending towards the reader (e.g. telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory, so it will not even be presented). While this may be true for a layperson reading the book, being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter.\n\nOverall, if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library, the last 40 pages are worth reading.

    "\nIf you are going to Walt Disney World Resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions, then this book may not be for you.  Some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step-by-step through them, including plot points in 3D movies and so on. The book also leaves a lot out in other areas, such as dining (little coverage), getting around Walt Disney World, and off-site hotels and dining.\n\nFor me, the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World (by Bob Sehlinger) was much better at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides. That is, it told me what might frighten a youngster, what might bore an adult, and so on, but it didn\u0027t say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions. Just generalizations about the ride, then specific warnings for different types of people.\n\nThe only things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide doesn\u0027t are pictures and info on some of the ancillary activities such as parasailing.

    "\nMr. Friedman\u0027s book begins with an interesting thesis, defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth.  The idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that Friedman often well supports with historical facts.  However, the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis, or if he just felt the need to write a book.  Furthermore, for every chapter in the book, there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that, with a little thorough thought or research, don\u0027t make sense or can easily be disproven.  With these things being the case, I find Friedman\u0027s argument a little hard to buy.  The entire book seems to build up to the final chapter, which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely, however, because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book (ie. the importance of education) do not add or support his final policy recommendations.  His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question \"What should the government do to promote economic growth?\"  They don\u0027t push the argument forward or indicate anything that hasn\u0027t already been suggested in the past, nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies. \n",
    "\nFor decades, African-American studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side.  For years, \"queer\" scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side.  This anthology tries to address that void.  It goes a long way in proving that black, gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones.  The anthology has representative numbers of men and women.  In some ways, it\u0027s a Who\u0027s Who of Black Gay Academia, including works from Cathy Cohen, Dwight McBride, and Jewelle Gomez.\n\nStill, there is much about this book that frustrated me.  A few years ago, a study was done of black LGBTs and most respondents said they hated the term \"queer,\" yet the academics here champion it.  Really, if \"queer\" is supposed to represent the four groups equally, then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered.  This is surprising given famous black bisexual writers such as Alice Walker, Stuart Hall, and June Jordan.  Often \"people of color\" is used when only blacks are brought up; Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans barely come up in this book at all.\n\nJames Baldwin is brought up often here.  I understand that.  His writings were rigorous and often dealt with racial and sexual issues simultaneously.  Still, I kept thinking about how bell hooks once wrote that Toni Morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers won\u0027t print the works of black women that are equally as sophisticated.  James Baldwin deserves his crown in black, gay letters, but I\u0027m concerned about him being the only one to get to wear a crown.  Several books have been printed about the many non-hetero members of the Harlem Renaissance, yet that group hardly comes up here.  James is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency.\n\nFinally, I had beef with many of the essays.  Charles Nero has great points but his essay is really two works glued together.  Can anyone really say the whiteness of New Orleans\u0027 \"gay ghetto\" is due to \"Chasing Amy\" or \"Six Feet Under\"?  One author could have written quickly about how he supported a gay, feminine student when that student was condemned by a masculine, heterosexual one.  Instead, he went on and on in unnecessary jargon and babble.  Kara Keeling\u0027s essay was 90% theory and 10% a discussion of Dunye\u0027s \"Watermelon Woman.\"  Why bother to bring up the film if you\u0027re barely going to discuss it?\n\nI wasn\u0027t really feelin\u0027 this text, but that\u0027s not to say it didn\u0027t have great aims\n",
    "\nIn a review remarkable for saying nothing about the book, Popop from Boston (April 9 below) alludes to some children blown up by an IRA bomb in a North of England shopping center. Popop is very broad-minded. It pains him that anyone would bad-mouth such \"armed operations\". They were perfectly justified, he explains, because of thousands of innocent Irish Catholics murdered at the hands of the British army.\n\nI know why thousands of murders are important to Popop. Without them, while he might justify random bombings in his own mind, he could hardly do so in decent company. But I live in Ireland, not America, where news of these murdered thousands has not reached us. Gerry Adams never said a word about them, not wishing to be laughed out of the country. He had to make the most all these years of a dozen fellows caught in a crossfire in Derry in 1973. I guess he saved the big one for the broad-minded boyos in Boston. What of all those dollars that Popop broad-mindedly dropped in the Semtex collection box? They were not wasted. Thousands of Irish really were murdered - mostly not Catholics but all of them really dead - at the hands of the disorganization that Mr Adams always denied being a member of. To be sure, his non-henchmen failed to terrorize the Northern Irish into caving in, but his enforcer, who can barely write his own name, did get to be Minister of Education (I\u0027m not making this up; I couldn\u0027t).\n\nOh, and the book is quite thought-provoking. There\u0027s a lot about Bushes, Arabs and the wrong kind of tax-cuts that went over my head. There\u0027s wit of a subtlety rarely seen since Voltaire - you can tell by the CAPITALS and !!!!. There are explanations of 9/11 to suit every taste, whichever Bush you blame. Myself, I suspect those Enrons. But Mr Moore did discover:\n\n\"THERE ... IS ... NO ... TERRORIST ... THREAT!\"\n\nHe paid us a flying visit, dined with some IRA capos who were laughing up their sleeves, and found the solution to the Irish Question without breaking sweat: everybody should be nice to each other\n",
    "\nInvestment Biker: 1-1/2 stars, just barely escapes the lowest possible rating.\n\nThis is a book about what a Tom Wolfe-style Master of the Universe does on holiday. It\u0027s nearly impossible to have an \"adventure\" when you are carrying 10(!) platinum credit cards. He got cold and wet a few times, worried about finding gas, didn\u0027t always have hotel rooms up to his standards, and had delays at some borders, yawn.\n\nThe adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to New York using one of his many Visa cards.\n\nI rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the same time Mr. Rogers was having his \"adventure.\" I am stunned that he perceived so little in his long travels.  I don\u0027t know how someone could travel in foreign countries that extensively and end up completely unchanged by the experience.  However, this fits perfectly with his huge arrogance, which is truly the theme of the book.  He already knows it all and will tell you all about it.\n\nWhich makes one wonder:  why did he bother to leave NY City in the first place?  I guess it was a good opportunity to pose with and boink the attractive and young (naive and pliable? -- certainly lubricious) daughter of one of his clients.  And a good opportunity to pump himself up by feeling superior to all those \"brown faces\" he\u0027s driving through.  The arrogance, the arrogance!  Typical privileged, right-wing know-it-all.  I\u0027d like to see him try to survive in the Peruvian highlands without all his money and fancy equipment.\n\nThis is not a travel book: Mr. Rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a long economic rant. You can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his final chapter, \"Afterword.\" I will summarize his position: governments are bad; smart, rich guys like me are good (remember October 1929?). Many of his predictions are laughably wrong. He advocated selling the US economy short in 1993.  Look at the US stock market performance from 1993 through 2000 ...  Gosh!  Idiot!  Some reviews are touting his prescience on markets.  Hello?  How about his predictions on the biggest economy in the world?\n\nMr. Rogers\u0027 writing is very poor and it\u0027s loaded with cliche\u0027s. He and Tabitha are always zooming on \"powerful steeds\" into \"gorgeous scenery\", or \"steep, craggy mountains\" into \"glitzy, glamorous hotspots\" or \"delightful, cozy hostels\", or across \"hot, empty, flat deserts\" into \"dumps\" that are not up to American standards. He\u0027ll \"describe\" one of the greatest mountain chains on earth, the Andes, as \"the top of the world\" (p. 315) for five short sentences and then move on to more important matters like further adventures with border guards and investing.  Great writing?  Rubbish!  I think he used a computer program to come up with his \"descriptions\" of the places he went.\n\nMr. Rogers is woefully ignorant about the places he goes - and he doesn\u0027t learn anything along the way. He views the world exclusively through the keyhole of economics. Most of the \"interesting facts\" he mentions about theses places are just wrong. One indicative example: He describes the Moreno Glacier in Argentina as, \"one of the few in the world still moving.\" (p. 294) I found myself laughing out loud many times at his \"facts\" and descriptions.\n\nIf you want to understand the distribution of goods in the world, read \"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\" by Jared Diamond. If you want to read about a real motorcycle trip, read Ted Simon\u0027s \"Jupiter\u0027s Travels,\" or Robert Fulton\u0027s, \"One-Man Caravan.\"\n\nFor good travel books, try:  \"Seven Years in Tibet\" (Harrer), \"News from Tartary\" (Fleming), \"Arabian Sands\" (Thesiger), \"Gypsy Moth Circles the World\" (Chichester), \"Sailing Around the World\" (Slocum), \"Motoring With Mohammed\" (Hanson), \"Full Tilt\" (Murphy), \"A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush\" (Newby), or \"Eastern Approaches\" (MacLean) \"My Life with the Eskimo\" (Stefansson), \"Endurance\" (Lansing).  I could go on and on.  \"Investment Biker\" is poorly-written drivel compared to all these and so many more.\n\n\"Investment Biker,\" a classic? That\u0027s ridiculous.\n\nFrom another review:  \"Greatest Book on Finance, Business, Travels Ever\"  That comment almost leaves me speechless.  Obviously written by someone who has read very few travel books indeed\n",
    "\nThe Case for Marriage makes arguments supportive of Pres. Bush\u0027s policies on marriage. However, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post (1/26/5) reports that Maggie Gallagher was paid over $40,000 by the Bush Administration to write columns and a \"private\" report supporting its $300 million HHS marriage initiative. \n\nMr. Kurtz reports that Ms. Gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers, writing \"I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it.\" She also states she was \"aware vaguely\" that her work was federally funded. It must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40,000. Bad memory, vagueness, national column: what will we say to the children? \n\nI wonder who paid Ms. Gallagher to write this book\n",
    "\nI was lured into reading Under the Volcano after seeing its inclusion on the Modern Library\u0027s One Hundred Best of the 20th Century and after reading a reviewer compare it to James Joyce (I am an amateur Joycean who tries to read Ulysess, Portrait of the Artist, and Dubliners at least annually).  Lowry has nothing that likens him to Joyce.  This book is leaden and tedious.  I forced myself to finish it because I hate to start a  book and not finish it.  But it was no labor of love.  It was simply a labor. \n",
    "\nThis is not one of Lonely Planet\u0027s best guides.  There is suprisingly little information.  For example, the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from Rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services.  basically, everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in Rekyavik, which luckily is run very well.  I found this really disappointing since Iceland is very expensive and I was hoping to keep down costs (in reality this is almost impossible, even eating at the grocery store I was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese) Furthermore, Iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details.\n\nAs with any tour book some of the info is out of date.  some of the museums and businesses were closed including the Icelandic Phallogical Museum.  It also seemed that this book was written for the high season in the summer months.  I went in March and found the information on the offseason limited and sometimes inaccurate.  I usually trust Lonely Planet but in this case I would have tried one of the other guide book companies or simply visit the tourist center when you get there.\n",
    "\n  I think the Linda Howard who wrote White Lies, Sarah\u0027s Child, Duncan\u0027s Bride, MacKenzies Mountain, Diamond Bay,etc. is one of the most talented current romance writers.\n Unfortunately, when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the \"big Time\", her writing started to decline. She is clearly in over her head now.  What a shame she couldn\u0027t stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers.\n  This just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it. This is pure \"Peter Principle\" in action.\nToo bad\n",
    "\nThat so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. Between her utterly uninspired \"devotional dances\" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the \"Sticky One\" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to \"anoint\" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. It\u0027s very, very amusing if you don\u0027t take it seriously. The thing that makes me sad is that she\u0027s just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. There\u0027s nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak \"evolutionary\". If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend\n",
    "\nThis book dragged on and on.  The ending was stupid and the plot was pathetic.  Very similiar to The Devil Wears Prada which was also bad.  Don\u0027t waste your time on this one\n",
    "\nUnlike Cussler\u0027s other series, I found this first story of the \"Oregon Files\" slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there\u0027s little to no character development even of \"Mr. Chairman\", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn\u0027t compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes. \n",
    "\nSparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks\u0027 books. I can\u0027t tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does.\n",
    "\nI read this book and I think presented material is not practical in commercial applications. In my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications. I know this is something different from contracts, by I think contracts are to complex, hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems. \n\nFor me another problem with contracts is problem in describing complex constraint that exists in problem domain. For example how to describe that objects must be cloned, not passed by reference or how to check that objects holded by readonly list not change their state during operations on list?\n\nRegards,\nMarci\n",
    "\nSome may disagree, and in fact, many have asked me why I disliked this one so much; so, here is why:\n\n- scratch \u0027plotting\u0027... by this point in the story, \u0027plodding\u0027 is more accurate. \n\n- caracatures over characters. A staple of the series, 2d characters; but by this point, when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story, it becomes an annoyance, a drag and overkill. \n\n- virtually zero gain. \nthe entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission, once accomplished (or not) is forgotten by the end of the book. The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments; sadly, it\u0027s very boring and slow. However...\n\n-... the book doesn\u0027t get good until the last fourth. \nAnd that, my friends, is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series. \n\nBy this point, it\u0027s obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it. However, as I said, things got really good in the last few chapters and led into \u0027Armageddon\u0027, one of the best books in the series. How ironic. \n\nThumbs way down for Left Behind: The Remnant. It\u0027s sad when the best part of the book is a scene involving the antichrist sunbathing on a rooftop.\n",
    "\n... and the maps are worthless.  \n\nTwo examples of the many glaring inaccuracies contained in this book:\n1) Rick claims you can pick up a bus map in any tourist information kiosk.

Um, Rick? Have you ever BEEN there? Did you notice the 40,000 other people there all trying to get in to the same things?

About the only table worth taking is 4-1, or 4-2. Sure its a minus three to your saves, and a minus 2 to your attack power, and a whole SLEW of HP. The rest of them are so painful they aren\u0027t worth taking. \n\nAlso all the caster \"Tables\" the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right doesn\u0027t make any sense. No matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it. Those could have been more thought out.\n\nAlso I question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables, A, D, and G. Seem to be a lot better than the B, E and H tables just from the way they interact with things. I do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your Legacy item is quite powerful, the I table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them. What I wish/want was if they\u0027re was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two I table skills. Also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid.\n\nThe rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers. Are very well thought out and are very powerful. Yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable. In a Caster heavy campaign like the one I run and participate in its a very low value book\n",

If you buy Roberts\u0027 version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.\n\nRoberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well.  Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve read all of Nevada Barr\u0027s Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder\u0027s not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.\n\nOstensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It\u0027s like bad language in humor--in general, it\u0027s just a cover for bad writing. \n\nIn Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story\u0027s setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I\u0027m sorry I spent my time and money on it\n",

I\u0027ll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I\u0027d much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn\u0027t think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.

It is worth the price for what it does contain but it is not without glaringflaws.The title \u0026quot;International\u0026quot; leads one to expect much more coverage of Pentecost outside of the U.S. Canada, where Pentecostal movements thrived in parallel with those in the U.S., is given very scanty treatment.Some major early Canadian apostles, such as O.J. Lovik, are skipped entirely. There is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize. A balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer, rather than by the leaders of those movements.Finally, there is too much credence and space given to sociological assessments of a movement that requires, above all else, keen spiritual discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff. That said, I will consult my copy often, for the great amount of useful material it does contain\n",

    "\nMr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject\u0027s wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.  \n\nJohn McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story\n",
    "\n    While I applaud Ms. Lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the Hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of Janie Hendrix\u0027s psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit, there are some very serious credibility problems here.  \n\n   While even the idle Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital, (Now Harbor View) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend.(Ouch) Jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so \u0027no one can profit from them\u0027.Meanwhile cigarette packs (yes, cigarette packs) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix ,siting Ms. Lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity. \n\n   At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying:\n\n\"The LSD passed around San Francisco was a fabulous discovery for me, I\u0027d taken acid in London but....\" \n\n     Aside from Jimi\u0027s use of the word \u0027fabulous\u0027 being at best incredulous, the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable. Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors, official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book, and the credibility of it\u0027s author are based on, extremely suspect. At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an aledged quote from Hendrix\u0027s mother who passed away in 1958:\n\n\"Jimi baby\" she told her son \"I have to escape this\"\n\n   While quotes like this can illicit an emotional response  \nfrom the average reader,they are clearly  fictional. Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted, if at all. I shared the recount of Jimi\u0027s trip to Berkeley as a small child (Pg.5) with Jimi\u0027s aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories. This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip. While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel  as \"Bill\" , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the Benson\u0027s who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the Hendrix\u0027s. \n\n  Lawrence\u0027s assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than Jimi\u0027s adopted stepsister Janie\u0027s claim that Jimi didn\u0027t OD.  Lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika\u0027s suicide, but the jist is clear. This book is more than a bit narcissistic with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject. While proclaiming herself to be a close confident of Hendrix\u0027 the general consensus is that she wasn\u0027t around that much, if people even know who she is at all.\n\n  For a much more well researched and credible look into Jimi\u0027s life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the new book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross. The Man, The Magic, The Truth, while very dramatic, is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject, not a biography or a reliable historical record. Unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available, their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned. \n\nRay Rae Goldman\nArchivist/Historian\nJames Marshall Hendrix Foundatio\n",

    "\nWhile I did find the book informative and a good supplement to Robert Sobel\u0027s The Great Bull Market: Wall Street in the 1920s, Galbraith interjects his sarcastic view of the participants in the 1920s Bull Market way too much.

    "\nI was very disapointed by this book. After just finishing the 400+ pages book \"Bull! from Maggie Mahar\" which is an absolute ecxellent book about market cycles (although the more recent boom of 1982-1999), \"The great Crash\" was really hard to read. It totally shows its age (it was written more than 50 years ago). The language is hard to understand and some words seem weird in todays time. \n\nBut its not just the language which makes this book not enjoyable. It is not written with much entertainment value, and the book I mentioned earlier shows clearly that it is quite possible to write an very entertaining book about the stock market. It also is very superficial, it doesn\u0027t go into much detail at all. It doesn\u0027t tell any examples of real people or anything which would make the book more readable. \n\nIt lists names and companies without doing a good part of explaning why it lists them. Sometimes I was thinking to myself \"Please get to your point.\"\n\nThat book was probably a good read in 1955 while people still could relate to most of the names he lists. But now (2004) there must be better books out there about the Crash of 1929.\n\nI give it two stars and not one (you can\u0027t give zero stars) because it has some interesting facts. Overall I would NOT recommend this book. Try another one about this subject\n",
    "\nI have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.  As others have pointed out, Coughlin\u0027s ego can be suffocating at times.  This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.  Alas it is not.  The writing is amateurish at best and the author\u0027s overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.  The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.  Again this could be forgiven as we\u0027re reading this book for a soldier\u0027s account, not that of an English grad student.\n\nThis book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick\u0027s \"One Bullet Away.\"  Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.  He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.\n\nYou cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin\u0027s character development is very superficial.  His attempts to convey a \"human side\" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.  This is a great contrast to the character development in \"One Bullet.\"  There is no connection between author and reader in \"Shooter.\"  Coughlin does not develop the role players either.  In \"One Bullet\" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men.  Additionally, Coughlin\u0027s demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.\n\nTo make matters worse the action isn\u0027t as well developed as in other titles.  The author\u0027s self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle.  He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting.  This can be found elsewhere.\n\nOverall this book was a great disappointment.  If only a fraction of Coughlin\u0027s self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper.  He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them\n",

    "\nSeveral reviews of this book, published elsewhere, stress\nthe contents of Rossi\u0027s analysis were more focused toward \nthe skeptical side of Egyptian math and construction methods.\nRossi, therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing new information within unproven paradigms.\n\nOn the math side, Rossi mentions Fibonacci\u0027s algorithm\nand phi, two paradigms that clearly were not used in ancient\nEgypt, though many like to suggest that they were. The\nFibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and J.J. \nSylvester\u0027s skeptical views of the RMP\u0027s 2/nth table, are \nreference point to 1202 AD and the Liber Abaci, but not \na reference point of Egypt. Egypt used more subtle ideas\nlike http://egyptianmath.blogspot.com and http://akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com .\n\nYet, Hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that Ahmes in 1650 BC \neasily wrote out 2/p series into short and concise unit \nfraction series using a very simple partitioning method \n(as Ahmes wrote out n/p answers in his \u0027false position\u0027 \nalgebra problems, ie. 5/19 written out in a long awkward \nseries using 1/12th as the first partition, as he did for 2/19,\nas describe a couple paragraphs below. Ahmes wrote 5/19\n\nper, 5/19 - 1/12 \u003d (60 - 19)/(12*19) \u003d (38 + 2 + 1)/(12*19)\n\nor, 5/19 \u003d 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/114 + 1/228). \n\nClearly modern scholars (two being Robins-Shute) have often suggested that \u0027false supposition\u0027 was used by Ahmes, hinting\nthat Ahmes guessed at his answers. Ahmes never guessed! Ahmes\u0027\nanswers were always exact when he worked with rational numbers.\n\nModerm scholars were the ones that had guessed, and missed, finding Ahmes deeper methods. Interestingly no scholar, until\nvery recently, has claimed to have read Ahmes\u0027 shorthand\nnotes. Modern scholars had sadly filled inlogical gaps left\nby Ahmes with their own intellectual guesses - many of which\nhave been proven to be wrong (as Rossi had not learned, since\nhe referenced none of the controversial Eguptian fraction and weights and measures issues).\n\nBruins also discovered the Hultsch method in 1945, and today \nthe method is named the Hultsch-Bruin method. It says that\n\n2/p \u003d 1/A  + (2A -p)/Ap\n\nwhere A, a highly divisible number selected in the range\n\n   p/2 \u0026lt; A \u0026lt; p\n\nwith the divisors of A uniquely added to (2A -p)\nthereby solving (2A-p)/Ap.\n\nExample,\n\n2/19 \u003d 1/12 + (24 -19)/(12*19)\n\n      \u003d 1/12 + (3 + 2)/(12*19)\n\n      \u003d 1/12 + 1/76 + 1/114\n\nwith the (4 + 1) alternative being discarded\nsince its last denominator was too large.\n \n\nRossi also mentions that Egyptian division may have followed\nan inverse operation of its multiplication \u0027doubling\u0027 method.\n\nHere also Rossi did not seen the simple remainder arithmetic\nfound in RMP #62 where 100/13 \u003d 7 + 9/13 \u003d 7 + 2/3 + 1/39.\n\nGenerally Ahmes and all scribes divided by this Q \u003d quotient\nand R \u003d remainder method. The Akhmim Wooden Tablet even \nshows a special method for grain and volume division where\na hekat unity 64/64 was divided by n, with n \u0026lt; 64, as\n\n(64/64)/n \u003d Q/64 + R/(n*64)\n\nEven more interesting, Ahmes also used this method to \ndivide 100 hekat by 70, with his final form matching\nthe Akhmim Wooden tablet\u0027s special use of ro \u003d 1/320th\nof a hekat, by:\n\n(6400/64)/70 \u003d 91/64 + 30/(70*64)\n\nand introducing ro \u003d 1/320 of a hekat,\n\n             \u003d (1 +16 + 8+ 2 + 1)/64 \u003d (150/70)* 1/320\n\n             \u003d 1+ 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32+ 1/64 + (2 + 1/7)*ro\n\nI\u0027ll not go on and discuss Rossi\u0027 view of Egyptian\narchitecture being the above her standard Cambridge \nskeptical comments.\n\nOverall, many accept Rossi\u0027s view as informative,\nand I do as well, in limited areas. However, on the \nmath side of Rossi\u0027s quick use of a Sylvester\u0027s and\nother recent skeptical techniques, all disproven years ago,\nshows that her Cambridge training needs to be expanded\nto read the Egyptian mathematical texts. Clearly Ahmes\nand his brother/sister scribes are the only experts \nthat should guide our understanding of Egyptian math.  \n",
    "\nI give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, \"DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson.\"\nThis most difinitive \"unproven\" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he \"seems\" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what \"reason\" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist  Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.  I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA  sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.  \n\nFrom what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade\u0027s analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased. \"Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings\" (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges. You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study. \n\nHe cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion. Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge. My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research. He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of \"authority\" on the controversy. She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson\u0027s grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words. To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, \"Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261).\" His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct. \n\nHe does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, \"Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story\", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging. Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, \"Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search\", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, \"The Jefferson-Hemings Myth\" are available through Amazon. \n\nI do agree with Wade\u0027s last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy.......\"Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve.\" I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of \"another\" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.\n\nHerb Barger\nJefferson Family Historian\nherbar@comcast.net          \n",

The idea is good: rein in the beast. But the major defect, which sinks the book, is the self-centered nature of the remedy. \n\nChristian men are given a toolkit to not look at booty.

    "\nThe principle question that arises from a reading of \u0026quot;Soul by Soul\u0026quot; by Walter Johnson is why was this book written? It is touted as history, yet not only does it lack any original historical material, it  also lacks any discernable historical facts. Rather than history,  \u0026quot;Soul by Soul\u0026quot; seems to be a mean-spirited, emotional tract  designed to promote two fundamental ideas: 1. that white people living in  the antebellum South were universally loathsome, brutish and cruel and 2.  that black people living in the antebellum South were universally noble,  good and abused. To support his views, Professor Johnson strings together a  loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist  literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings. His personal  contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche  of the book\u0027s long deceased characters and divine their true, but unspoken,  motives and thoughts. Quite a feat for any historian!      One loses count  of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using  their \u0026quot;probing fingers\u0026quot; in this book. Fortunately, in between  probes, the reader can be shocked by the \u0026quot;killing fields of the lower  South,\u0026quot; the \u0026quot;historical sexualization of black bodies,\u0026quot; the  \u0026quot;slaveholders\u0027 inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of  their slaves,\u0026quot; and the \u0026quot;brutish perogatives of whiteness.\u0026quot;  This is heavy, hate-filled stuff worthy of a TV mini-series but it is out  of place in a supposedly serious history text.       I live in a former  slave quarter in New Orleans. In the antebellum period, this building and  its resident slaves were, interestingly enough, owned by a free black who  was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation. As an  amateur historian, I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans  slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these  markets. What were their addresses? What percentage of their customers were  black? What percentage were white? How many slaves did the typical New  Orleans household have? How were they fed and clothed? What were their  working hours? These are basic questions that should have been addressed  but instead, the reader is given an emotionally charged, repetitious,  boring rehash of tired, previously published material. In short, this book,  for the most part, reads like a rambling, overly long sermon. Anyone  seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look  elsewhere and should consider reading the \u0026quot;Slave Narratives\u0026quot;  compiled by the Federal Writers Project, \u0026quot;Time on the Cross\u0026quot; by  Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman and \u0026quot;The Slave Trade\u0026quot; by Hugh  Thomas. The first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves  performed by the W.P.A. in the 1930\u0027s. The latter two works contain  original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery, not  the emotions\n",
    "\nSure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that it\u0027s this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world\n",
    "\nAnother farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don\u0027t come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot\u0027s guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad...\n",
    "\nA biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but \"I would do it again.........\".\nThe recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast:\n\"GOODBYE, DARKNESS\", William Manchester\n\"GOD IS NOT HERE.....\", Richard Overton\n\"THE QUIET HERO\", Gary W. Toyn\n\"FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS\", James Bradley\n\"THE LAST LIEUTENANT\", John Shively\nThese men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.\n\n",
    "\nThis book states that it\u0027s better to die than survive a rape:\n\n\"Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one\u0027s virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle.\" (p.196)\n\nHow much more twisted can it get?\n\n",
    "\nThis story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn\u0027t get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the \"intelligent conversation\" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It\u0027s a title to read if you wish to be considered \"well read.\" Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from \"To Kill A Mockingbird.\"\n",

It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to.\n",
    "\nSadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk\u0027s misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk\u0027s characters. It\u0027s hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.\n\nI guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don\u0027t make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.         \n",

It\u0027s just that the writer\u0027s style is so abstract and nebulous that he\u0027s absolutely maddening to try and follow. One moment, he\u0027ll be talking about how religion evolved, and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask, \"What in the world is he saying now?\" I got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense, and then noticed how he drifted here and there, making good points and then totally abandoning them. \n\nI bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because I had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it!! It never seemed to get better. I gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of, but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author!\n\nOverall, I really cannot recommend it unless you are a VERY slow, contemplative reader who doesn\u0027t mind an unorthodox read.

I am a first time parent, so I need some help/guidance; thsi is why I baught this bbok.  \n\nThere is nothing to guide me on which activity is for what age group, so I don\u0027t know if an activity is for 18 months or 24 or 12 months- ie amI challenging my toddler, am I boring him or amI providing him with the right fun activity for his age??? Some of the activities are too obvious- it seems like the author wrote down anything she could think of just to fill in 365 activities in the bookl and there is you see the author\u0027s luck of creativity and/or knowledge of the subject.  Also the descriptiosn are very brief with limited illustrations.\n\nI really don\u0027t understand why anyone will give 5 stars to this book.  I don\u0027t care about the money I spent for the book.  I care that I ended up with something that I can not really use to provide my toddler with fun.  For that reason I strongly recommend the othe rbook (Wendy S. Masi\u0027s book).  Yes it has 100 instea dof 365 activities, but it is colorfull, easy and pleasant to read and each activity is marked by an ege indicator.

    "\nWithout question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and Steve Allen\u0027s pivitol role it. Sadly Ben Alba\u0027s \"Inventing Late Night: Steve Allen and the Original \"Tonight Show\u0027\u0027, is not that book. It is, largely, a poorly edited and self-contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by Allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with Allen\u0027s TV contemporaries. These interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers Scott Berg (Sam Goldwin) or Neal Gabler (Walter Winchle).\nThe opening chapter, which addresses Allen\u0027s dysfuntional up-bring, education and his early days in radio and TV sets the stage for the author\u0027s failure to create a full-blooded, well-rounded analytical portrait of Allen and his work. Alba draws here, almost exclusively and certainly uncritically, from Allen\u0027s memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews. Taking Allen and the reader\u0027s one independent witness at face value, Allen had a rootless, violent and unstable childhood. Given these negative conditions Alba gives  no hint of how, why or even if, Allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family. The author gives us two brief stories from Allen\u0027s adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured. Actually, all the stories show is that Allen attended an uncle\u0027s funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his Sunday night show. How did this dysfunctional world of Allen\u0027s youth effect his two marriages and five sons? Why, after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did Allen choose this same career field for himself? Alba doesn\u0027t even pose such questions about the boy\u0027s effects on the man. He just plows ahead in a haliographic haze. Throughout \"Inventing...\" Alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance Allen\u0027s words. No other witnesses are called, no other points of view are examined. Steve tells a story; Alba accepts it and edits it into his text. Why not read Allen straight?\n",
    "\nIt truly is the best war fiction regarding WWII if you have never read ANY other fiction regarding WWII. I love war fiction and non-fiction and beside parroting the Time Magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel I can not even come close to understanding why anyone, let alone review after review, would even come close to that stupefying conclusion. To me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with. Only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating. What it is, is a bloated, narcisstic, misogynistic waste of time. \n\nOf course any piece of literature is subjective, but to me, this critically acclaimed work fails on every level that a novel should, regardless of genre. Unless you love James Joyce (another bad writer lorded over us by the critically elite), I think most readers expect some sort of plot development. Don\u0027t expect that here. How about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel? You better pick up something else.  It seems to me the reader should at least be invested in one of the character\u0027s outcome. Far too pedestrian a thought if you \"get\" this art. If I can\u0027t have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely likable? Forget it non-ivy leaguer! I was rooting for the Japanese to kill them all, so at least their \"loved\" ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally despicable human beings. The only thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the painful experience of reading these soldier\u0027s hateful ruminations while, oh by the way, a war was being fought around them. Nope, no big ending either. It just ends. \n\nYes, I have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the entire book is to symbolize war itself. Give me a break. While this may be bad news for us common folk duped into reading it, it certainly is good news for Tom Clancy. His last two decades of literature are just misunderstood genius depicting the banality of human existence and not bad writing at all.\n",

Some \"intellectuals\" actually support the tired mantras of Marx\u0027s philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven\u0027t seen enough sunlight, I don\u0027t know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you).

What\u0027s worse, the specifics in the book have given terrorists valuable intelligence without giving anyone else anything usable (Unless cocktail party whining is a \"use\").  In the wake of this book and the politically-motivated NY Times story, the bad guys have already started altering how they do their communications.  Great news for American civilians and military members alike.   \n\nThis book might have a place 10-20 years down the line.

The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook.  I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others.  If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on \"Essence Brings you Great Cooking\" by Jonell Nash, \"The Ebony Cookbook\" by Freida DeKnight or \"The Black Family Reunion Cookbook\" by the The National Council of Negro Women.

    "\nI\u0027ve always been a big believer in \"attack the message\" (if you don\u0027t agree), don\u0027t attack the messenger.

But his book was so filled with errors, personal opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events, people and general culture, as to make it a book of fiction; not one of fact. \n\nHe stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them.  He relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he wasn\u0027t born into a poor family of migrant laborers.  Perhaps born as Ms. Condoleezza Rice?  She is certainly a good example of someone held down by evil conservatives and not permitted to excel in life (not).  Living in, and exposed to, the surroundings of his childhood, it appears to me his life\u0027s goal was to become a professional victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth.   He\u0027s, so far, at least succeeding in that!   Being an accomplished loser.   What a goal! \n\nHis only \"accomplishment\" was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of The DailyKOS.   \n\nHaving written his fictional book of what life is NOT like in Johnson County, Kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of life\u0027s losing lottery, he really has nothing else to say.   Perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the Left writing the same type of fiction over and over (as he just did for the NY Times).  He must be a very unhappy person.  It seems most liberals are.  How sad.  The only real obstacle they have in life is seen in their mirror each morning.

    "\nI recently read this as part of a survey of childrens\u0027 literature about the Medieval period. Let me say first, that the dialogue is completely modernized, with not even a complex word to redeem it. I know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect, but please, our children are more sophisticated than that. Adam is self-involved, careless, and annoyingly stupid. Despite it\u0027s touted 320 pages, this could have been printed in 150, and contained much the same material. The only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of Latin and Old English ballads scattered throughout. If you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times, with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability, have them read Song of the Gargoyle. It\u0027s also about a boy who loses his father, and has to search for him, in the company of a dog-like being, but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash. The boy is also a minstrel, of sorts, but he has more likable qualities than Adam, as well as more adventures in less pages. The ending is a happy one, but it involves a twist, which isn\u0027t at all forseeable, as theat in Adam of the Road.

Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).  I\u0027m not saying that other lifeforms don\u0027t exist in the Universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.  It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  Historically, there\u0027s been the Barbarians, Huns, Mongols,  Pagans, Jews, Christians, Vikings, black Natives, Cannabals, red Natives, Mexicans, Germans, Nazis, Communists, now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.  Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80\u0027s.  The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit \"underground\") than most people can fathom.  What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which Strieber has been front and centre at various times.  My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.  In this book, his \"hard-evidence\" is flimsey and suspicious.  For example, why wouldn\u0027t super advanced Aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any X-ray, MRI, CT, etc)?  And design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?  Surely, this would be child\u0027s play for Alien scientists?  Why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or NAZI connection with abductions?  There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange \"fragments\" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.  Why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the Greys?  Why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?  Why are some speaking English, others German?  Why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically Antartica?  These are things Strieber never mentions, which I find curious.  My point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and Strieber\u0027s books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas.      \n",
    "\nJohn R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text.  And Mr. Barry, as with many com. theory persons I\u0027ve met since (GTRI in Atlanta, GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo, CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne, FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs.  Essentially, it\u0027s their Bible.  The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis, especially from an engineering perspective, are very third rate.  Trying to use this text in a classroom situation, especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor, is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective.\n\nJohn R. Barry, for example, is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldn\u0027t be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech).  But as an engineer, John R. Barry, as with the other followers of Proakis, compares very unfavorably (in fact, I don\u0027t consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the department\u0027s economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e., vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes, I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolie\u0027s Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality aren\u0027t so important).  There are far, far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise].  And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe \"engineer\"] is not mathematical ability, memorized knowledge, or even rhetorical shrewdness, but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility.  \n\nIn fact, the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only  Intellectual Abuse, but also a Spiritual sort as well. In a nation (where Steven Pinker, who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame, has noted) that has around 75% of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things, this kind of Spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences.  Though it may not be intentional, nevertheless, the values and beliefs of Proakis\u0027s text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive.  These values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student\u0027s own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs.  The result is almost always a broken-spirit.  From an economic perspective, this is bad. Very bad. And it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it.\n\nMost of the \"engineers\" now being \"developed\" by the followers of Proakis (e.g., John R. Barry) are very analogous to Mid 20th Century Carribean medical school \"doctors.\"  They can say, write, and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes, i.e. writing up invoices to Insurance/Government agencies.  These \"engineers\" like those \"doctors\" don\u0027t and probably never will understand the essence of their professions, though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do.  When in fact, they are utterly clueless \"professionals.\n",

    "\nI came to Blowback by way of a year-long research project on  globalization. Over the past year I have read dozens of books, both scholary and popular, on this topic. Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi-Cultural - Eurocentric; I\u0027ve suffered through them all ( happily, there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ). \n\nFirst let me state that Chalmers Johnson, this regrettable book notwithstanding, is not by profession the village diot. Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst, a man who used to be worth listening to.\n\nWhat happened?  How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg? Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from? Johnson, where did you go?\n\nWell, the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge.  His take on America\u0027s military policies is ludicrous.  Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north, where he will discover NORTH KOREA. Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy.  Conspiracy \"theory\" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated; it\u0027s their sanctuary; but for a scholar of Johnson\u0027s caliber to go there is incomprehensible. Unti you see what I saw.\n\nThe professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing, all in scholarly language.  For the most part the popular books were  not nominally about globalization at all, although globalization was the only thread holding the books together, and to each other. Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ),the only possible reason for these immensely angry, nonsensical books is this: no one fully understands globalization.  No one. Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast, too young to tame; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob. They\u0027re frustrated, these authors.  I can\u0027t blame them, but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the\u0027ve rounded up the usual suspect, America, as in why does America impose - dominate - ignore, etc. the third world?  Silly question, really. You\u0027re at the top of the food chain, what do they expect you to do? When bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else.\n\n",
    "\nThis book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other\u0027s excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating. \n\nThe first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It\u0027s all tied together with attempts at \"edgy\" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying \"infotainment telesector\"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term \"McWorld,\" which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term \"Jihad.\" Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.\n\nWhen it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber\u0027s arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber\u0027s contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book\u0027s final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book\u0027s title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world.

    "\nIn today\u0027s world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, \"cultural,\" religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.\n\nExample: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict (\"Jihad\" is Barber\u0027s label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants (\"McWorld\" is Barber\u0027s label for this).\n\nThat\u0027s the book. \n\nThis might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book\u0027s insights novel or pointed. If you\u0027re new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the \"terrorism\u0027s challenge to democracy\" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn\u0027t accurately reflect the book\u0027s content. \"Jihad\" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book\u0027s many examples of parochialism\n",

She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them \"my girls,\" for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader.

    "\nin the possibility that Steve Berry could ever transcend his not-so great debut, The Amber Room.  Romanov Prophecy started in the right direction, Third Secret was OK, but I think he hit his *peak* right there.\n\nI really want authors to get better--heck, I hope to write better papers as I go along in college.  But, Steve Berry, sorry.  And for all you people out there who don\u0027t like it when people give negative reviews of a book you like, just hang on a second before you give me a big fat NO vote.  \n\nFirst of all, even though this is fiction, the whole Da Vinci Code genre purports to be based on fact.  Berry always writes his Note at the end to underscore this.  However, if you want the reader to accept your plot, please get some basic facts correct first.  The most annoying one for me, as, ahem, a French major, is the very dramatic chapter closer where they zip off to the \"Palais des Popes.\"  Excuse.  Me.  \"Popes\"?  Just because the English word looks kind of like the French word \"pape\" (for pope) doesn\u0027t mean you can flippantly swap them!  Eek.  And, btw, this is a real place, so some editor somewhere should have noticed this.  Shame on you, S.B.\u0027s editors.  OK, I\u0027m not saying a novel must contain no anachronisms whatsoever (it IS fiction, after all), but really big, glaring mistakes of geography or history cannot be tolerated.\n\nThe other main issue I have with this book is the vehement attack on Jesus Christ and the resurrection and the Bible as a whole.  Cotton Malone, our hero, says that the Bible contains hundreds (I\u0027m paraphrasing) glaring inconsistencies.  If I remember correctly, he says that one of the gospels (he picks on Matthew a lot) doesn\u0027t place Bethlehem as the place of Jesus\u0027 birth.  That one doesn\u0027t hold water--I checked Matthew myself.  Says so in ch. 2.  I don\u0027t mean to thump the metaphorical Bible, but who is Steve Berry to question the authenticity of the world\u0027s #1 bestseller ever?  That\u0027s quite audacious ... some would even say blasphemous--but I tread on glass.  \n\nI really can\u0027t go into the terrible character development, or lack thereof, or the wussy Knights Templar.  Yeah, they\u0027re big and bad, but Malone seems to bump them off with the greatest of ease.  Some \"Knights of Christ\" they are.  \n\nWell, having alienated most of you, I bid you farewell as I go in search of a more worthy book\n",
    "\nJesus, talk about the little girl crying \"wolf.\" When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. \n\nThe book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We\u0027re given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.\n\nThe big story is, alas, not so impressive. It\u0027s a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, \"crashing and bleeding out,\" cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you\u0027re a PETA type.\n\nThe worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don\u0027t die at the end. Basically, he\u0027s trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you\u0027re supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you\u0027re tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you\u0027re addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax\u0027s hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you\u0027ve finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?\n\nI wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can\u0027t. Preston\u0027s ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to \"get into the minds\" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston\u0027s inability to write. \n\nIf you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot\u0027s Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you\u0027re pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom\u0027s Cabins of scientific accounting\n",

There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader.\n\nBaxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.  Again, there is no context.  He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book.\n\nIf viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much.  If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author\u0027s life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.  \n\nThere were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between.\n\nIf you could not tell by now, I can not see much reason to read this book.

    "\nIt is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject.  The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn\u0027t understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: \"She made for the east exit...\"  Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit?  I just don\u0027t know what to picture there.  The word \"made\" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I haven\u0027t read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder, however, why his editor didn\u0027t send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isn\u0027t one of them.

However, he warns, a diet of junk food can be fatal.\n\nGood advice concerning pop culture-but even more applicable to this book. Yes, it contains a kernel of truth, but it ultimately is dangerous if not balanced by a heavy diet of other thinkers and theologians such as Thomas Merton, St. Francis of Assisi, Ron Sider, Tony Campolo, Brian McLaren, Brother Lawrence, Philip Yancey, Wendell Berry-the list goes on. It often is guilty of oversimplifying the ideological conflicts the modern Church faces, drawing the lines down to \"Christians\" against the \"naturalists\" or \"humanists,\" thus ignoring the wide range of threats that seek to destroy the Church.\n\nWhile there is truth in Colson\u0027s writing, I believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by comfortable middle-class American thought and militaristic nationalism, sprinkled with the politically correct amount of Christian belief. His faith seems to be overly academic, one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and other spiritual disciplines. Evangelism, it seems to Colson, is comprised heavily of apologetics. The secularists must be shown that they are wrong, he says. Yes, there is truth and there is time for debate, but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships. \n\nYou see, I used to fear evolutionists and the proverbial round table of \"secular humanists\" that many conservative evangelicals love to discuss. But as I\u0027ve grown, I realize that threats to the Church come more often from within than from secular culture, and they almost always have more to do with power and politics than the Enlightenment or science.\n",
    "\nI borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.  \nSomeone needs to give me a book of Barr\u0027s to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.) \n",
    "\n\"Just Enough\" is more than enough:  A turgid, pretentious, strident, and wholly unoriginal piece of work.  Its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior, nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature. At best, this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the Harvard Business Review, but surely not enough material for 280 pages!  Better to read \u0026quot;Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow : Discovering Your Right Livelihood,\u0026quot; by MARSHA SINETAR, and call it a day\n",

    "\nIt is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.  \n\nOut of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.\n\nWhether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories.\nThe atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.\n\nHaving read most of Mr. Grisham\u0027s other books, I expected better from him. \n",
    "\nI like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.   \n\nGrisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs\u0027 lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.   \n\nIn the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn\u0027t help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn\u0027t care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.\n\nThis novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn\u0027t find the story interesting enough to recommend.\n\nFor a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr.\n",
    "\nOwen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk.  He comes off as arrogant, showing little empathy towards Debra\u0027s problems earlier on in their marriage ( eating disorder, depression, social anxiety).  He writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble Debra was in, but instead are very embarrassing to her.  He comes across as a husband with no compassion.  It\u0027s ironic that he goes on and on about Debra\u0027s poor choices in boyfriends over the years, and how they were always so controlling of her....and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and Debra didn\u0027t keep the house tidy...and he didn\u0027t approve of the way she dressed!!  Seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated.  He repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is, his GPA, jobs, earning potential, etc...but then admits that when they separated, he sticks Debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off!  He says it was in her name, so she can have it!  Owen shows how little a man he really is in this book. Debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid, and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart, she wouldn\u0027t have gone down the road she did.  I feel very sorry for Debra after reading this book\n",

    "\nMark Twain called the Book of Mormon \"chloroform in print\" and he wasn\u0027t kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don\u0027t know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it\u0027s worth a shot).  \n\nJoseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a \"glass looker\" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use \"magic stones\" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found \"gold plates\" and used what he called the \"Urim and Thum\" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).  \n\nThere are SO many myths that are told by members of the church \"most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy\", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith\u0027s actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what\u0027s up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...\n\nI am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that\u0027s great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don\u0027t just rely on the \"power of prayer\".

The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  \"Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after.\"  \n\nI hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time. \n",
    "\nMark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America.  Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word \"interesting\" to describe it.  Did they actually read it?\n\nThis book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways.  I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever.  This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas.  The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument.  \n\nNot only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US.  He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument. \n",

I\u0027d had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol.

    "\nHave you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on?  For me, that was this book.  If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book.  It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah.  She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door.  She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream.  She now has a new name, Chaya.  She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body.  It takes place in New Rochelle.  It is old times.  It doesn\u0027t give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting.  She doesn\u0027t know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it.\n\tI didn\u0027t like this book at all.  I thought it was really hard to follow.  You have to pay attention throughout the whole book.  You can never daydream or you won\u0027t know why they are calling her a new name.  This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level.  If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book.  I don\u0027t recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader.  This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers.  I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book.  I don\u0027t think this book was a page turner.  I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down.  It never sparked my interest.  Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn\u0027t relate to anything that happened.  This book was hard to concentrate on.  If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard.  I couldn\u0027t relate to anyone. I am not Jewish.  If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could.  I didn\u0027t like the genre.  It was all fake and totally unrealistic.  If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don\u0027t like fantasy.  I didn\u0027t like how it was written.  It was too hard to concentrate on.  I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name.  I never found any surprised in the story.  I could guess what would happen next.  It was predictable.  None of the chapters had cliffhangers.  If just was boring and that\u0027s it.  I thought it was extremely boring.  I didn\u0027t understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book.  My mind wandered a lot.  I had to read sections over and over again.  I never believed the plot one bit.  With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched.  I think older people would enjoy this book, because they would be the only ones who could understand it. \n\n",

    "\nFor someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it\n",
    "\nBefore I started reading \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\" the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.\n\nUnfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don\u0027t get me wrong, it wasn\u0027t terrible, it just wasn\u0027t very good.\n\nI\u0027m not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In \"Zen\" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s.

The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of \"quality.\" \n\nI\u0027m not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It\u0027s standing as a work of philosophy is not much better.

If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, \"I just can\u0027t go on with this story!\" I\u0027m going to throw the book at the wall.  Also, so many embarrassing little holes.  If I were a librarian I would say, \"So Dracula\u0027s checked out.  Go to a bookstore.  Every bookstore in the country has a copy.\"  And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you\u0027re going to fire it).  Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them.  Unless \"Dracula\" is related to our heroine--that would be good.  Will read a bit more. . .\n",

    "\nI read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn\u0027t folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn\u0027t recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way\n",
    "\nLet me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I\u0027ve read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.\n\nI truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she\u0027s lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn\u0027t let books like this be printed.\n\nThis story pretty much follows stories she\u0027s done before except it\u0027s told from the guy\u0027s point of view.  There\u0027s the rich guy, Charlie, who can\u0027t seem to find the \"perfect\" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he\u0027s afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.\n\nThen there\u0027s rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let\u0027s him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.\n\nThe last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.\n\nThe three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie\u0027s yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don\u0027t want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.\n\nDanielle Steel should stop writing.  You can\u0027t tell me she doesn\u0027t have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won\u0027t even bother renting them from the library.  I won\u0027t waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I\u0027m going to read them\n",
    "\nThis is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.\n\nFlashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon\u0027s own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary. \n\nIf you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.\n\nI will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third.\n",

    "\nIf an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery, you\u0027d think they\u0027d have a lo say about it, right? Well, Ford certainly expends plenty of words, but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories. Mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament, the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white, middle-aged, married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity. Story after story plods cautiously along, poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way, with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness. Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male. Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons, and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it. I have no idea what his personal background or situation is, but it\u0027s a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something. If he wasn\u0027t such a literary bigshot, there\u0027s no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over, and isn\u0027t provocative, insightful, or even interesting. PS. If you were planning on the audio version, don\u0027t. Ford is a terrible reader, sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment\n",

    "\nThe official censes of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1900s showed well over five million Christians living in the provinces of what are now modern Turkey.  Western specialists who helped the Turks conduct their censes stated that the Turks purposely undercounted the Christians and overcounted the Turks.  So, there were many more than just five million Christians.  There are now approximately only a hundred thousand Christians in Modern Turkey.  The question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today.  We know that over a million surviving Greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923.  Again, what happened to the huge difference of 4-5 million people?  To the 1.5 million massacred Armenians, must be added three quarters to a million Assyriac Christians (Aramaic-speaking Arab Christians) and as many as two million Greeks (almost 30 percent of the Greek people).  The author does not touch on the large numbers of Christians who were enslaved by Turks or forced to convert to Islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number Greek-speaking \"Turks\" around Trebizon on the Black Sea.  \n\nIt is not as if there is not vast contemporary accounts of neutral and Western observers of this enormous genocide and ethnic cleansing of the original, pre-Turkish populations of Anatolia.  I can only conclude that the author had such an inborn bias in favor of Turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the Jewish holocaust of WWII.  Avoiding this subject amounts to holocaust denial.  \n\nThe Christian genocide was the first great genocide of the 20th century and Hitler\u0027s model for the Jewish genocide. The massacre of the Greek and Armenian population of Smyrna (now Izmir) ranks with the Rape of Nanking in sheer horror and scale, but the author skips over it in a rush to avoid any detail of the crime or assign any blame except to the Greeks and Armenians by repeating the discredited canard that they set fire to their own city.  \n\nThe author\u0027s treatment of the Christian genocide reminds me of the comments to me of a Turkish officer at a NATO conference which were to the effect that there had been no Armenian genocide (the Turkish Government official line) but, in any case, that they had deserved it.  The author seems to have taken her treatment of the subject from the Turkish Government as well\n",
    "\n\"Karl Marx, years ago, gave a description of why this might be happening. He followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value: an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make.\" \n\nNO IT\u0027S NOT!!! An object\u0027s worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers. To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make, which would mean that we should subsidize the military-industrial complex, since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things. \n\n\"Petty-bourgeois\u0027 owners, i.e. the mom-and-pop stores and small business in general, of which my grandpa, a dentist, was a part of, are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail.\" \n\nThis is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government. All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out. There\u0027s a reason why the owner\u0027s of Wal-Mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $8, as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt, lay off employees, and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal-Mart. Another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to Wal-Mart (Wal-Mart collects millions in subsidies due to Marx\u0027s Labor Theory of Value once again) and of the use of emminent domain abuse (which can be justified on the grounds of the \"greater good\" as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores). \n\n\"But no theory is ever flawless, and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and \"reality.\" There is no reason to believe that heavy social hierarchy and class division is a necessary evil; workers CAN manage their lives just fine through cooperatives.\" \n\nSure there is. Human beings are inherently unequal, differing in many skills, abilities, ambition, the choices that they make in life, how they apply their time, etc. etc. Of course, there is isn\u0027t any reason that individuals can\u0027t create wealth nonetheless, creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some good or service itself. And cooperatives need to be voluntary first. Nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth.  There needs to be some Division of Labor, Trade and Commerce, etc. or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the real law of the jungle to survive.  This can\u0027t happen if everything is collectively owned. \n\n\"Since workers are the sole producers of goods from scratch to end\" \n\nNO! Entreprenuers, innovators, etc. provide much of the creativity, design, direction for the purchase and use of capital goods, negotiation of deals, evaluation of threats, problems, and consumer requests, and other such things. It wasn\u0027t the workers at Microsoft who created cheap desktop computers, it was Bill Gates, the workers are merely a form of mass-production who help out, but ultimately mass produce a good or service in exchange for privately owned wages, caused by supply and demand.\n",
    "\nPick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens...\"happily lived ever after\". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don\u0027t know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80\u0027s (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them\n",

Eddie is no Willy Loman, though, and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central, driving force like Willy.

There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York, and it is the only topic that is at all explored well, if still unsatisfactorily.  Eddie\u0027s dreams are represented in his pretty niece, Catherine; and unlike Willy Loman\u0027s uncle, she is still an attainable dream. That makes Eddie\u0027s life seem all the more petty, in comparison to Willy\u0027s: he longs wearily not after what he could have had, but after what he can never have, as he is already married.

My statement has nothing to do with the author\u0027s writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul\u0027s life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  \n\nIf you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.

    "\nSince God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion.  When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God.  Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact.  So pain is God\u0027s megaphone.  If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain.  Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone.  But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to \"plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls.\"    \n\nWhere does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from?  Given mankind\u0027s painful existence, \"an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous.\"  God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed.  Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - \"What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?\"  One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible.  Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters?  I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true.  Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God\u0027s viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love.  In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as \"damn nonsense.\"  Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.\n\nLewis\u0027s insistence that people have free will needs to be examined.  Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin.  Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception.  The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability.  Abused children typically grow up to be abusers.  In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23.  Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will.  Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop.  In most people it remains largely dormant.  Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability.  Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.\n\nLewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution.  Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man\u0027s appearance on Earth.  Somehow, the perfectly good \"Paradisal Man\" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan.  Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.\n\nLewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic.  Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation.  I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life.  The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity.  According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God.  I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug.  I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible.  Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ.  I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender.  Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan\u0027s ultimate deception.  But I have also experienced Satan within myself.  If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan.  I know the difference.  I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.\n\nI am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound.  In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth:  It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence.  This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control.  There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness.  As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain.  The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents.  What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything.  Satan can therefore be described as \"God\u0027s self-ignorance.\"  Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical.  C. S. Lewis tells us that \"it is not God\u0027s purpose that we should go back into that old identity.\"  I think I agree with him on this point.  Mankind\u0027s goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.\n(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA:  A YOUNG MAN\u0027S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)              \n",
    "\nI\u0027ve enjoyed Johansen\u0027s books for years, but this one was awful...I\u0027m beginning to wonder if she\u0027s using a ghost writer.  Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase \"Sophie said through her teeth...\"  I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book.  Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this!  I\u0027m praying she isn\u0027t falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher\u0027s deadline\n",
    "\nI am a chef and an avid collector of cookbooks. I find the recipes of this book to be mediocre at best, terribly organized and lengthy. I am not interested in Lawson\u0027s endless anecdotes, rather, I would prefer her stories to be replaces by pictures (an essential for cooking books, in my opinion), of which there are none. I was disappointed, and would not recommend this book to anyone. For basic, great recipes, I would suggest any of Ina Garten\u0027s books. Her recipes are no-fail and the books are well done.\n",
    "\nThis is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz\u0027s recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in \"The Hideaway\" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.\n\nThe Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.\n\nI don\u0027t know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.\n\nThe final issue is Koontz\u0027s near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz\u0027s tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.\n\nDean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts\n",
    "\nSometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that \"Three Junes\" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that\u0027s my style.

    "\nAs an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, I was very disappointed in Mr. Brands\u0027 book. It appeared to me that Mr. Brands\u0027 intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic\u0027s point of view. While any good biography worth its salt should present a balanced view of the man, Mr. Brands appears to go out of his way to find fault in almost all of TR\u0027s actions. TR was by no means a perfect man, however, history has proven him to be one of our greatest presidents. One gets the sense after reading this dreadfully long and depressing account of TR that Mr. Brands\u0027truly disliked his subject\n",

    "\nWhen I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.  Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.  On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90\u0027s when the book was written, and it just doesn\u0027t read as the brilliant critique that I expected.  We\u0027ve now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix \"challenged\" that it just isn\u0027t funny anymore.  I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn\u0027t aged well over the ten years since\n",
    "\nThe chief problem with this book is that the writer incorporates the French perspective by using citations in French with no translations.  I took 2 years of high school French but I\u0027m not that good!  This could be overlooked except that, for obvious reasons, I was very interested to hear the perspective of French writing on this lopsided defeat.  The experience was like someone telling a long joke and them mumbling the awaited punchline, or someone tearing out the last page of a riveting mystery novel.  I simply can\u0027t believe key citations weren\u0027t translated.  \n\nOtherwise the study of Henry V was great, and I would like to hear more about him (except since he died young I probably heard it all already.)  The treatment of the battle was superficial, but perhaps given the lack of material this could be understood, but more could be done\n",
    "\nI must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD.  This book made me that much more skeptical.  In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist.  This case is different though.  On page 67 of the paperback copy I got, Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other.  Her answer that she or as she claims her \"troops\" give is that it is through the use of \"thought transference\" which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on.  I almost burst out laughing when I read that.  She also contradicts her claim that the alters don\u0027t know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time.  Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as \u0027we\u0027.  Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies.  The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic.  Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories, ufo sightings, satanic ritual abuse, and second sight.  I think she is not credible in the least.  There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them.  She does let us know in the book that she is very creative, artistic, intelligent, and apparently well read.  I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities.  The book itself is long, boring, anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end.  She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities.  Don\u0027t waste your money on this book, unless you have to read it for a class as I did. \n",

    "\nI was there, as were several of my fellow Sitka Fire Department EMT\u0027s and State Troopers from the Sitka Academy.  The 6 of us, along with two parajumpers from the Canadian Armed Services were flown through the typhoon winds, on a helicopter, out to the Williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers - literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed.  We knew there was a doctor onboard, from Anchorage, but we literally never met or saw him - I\u0027m sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up - but that is where he stayed.  The real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend.  But I was disappointed to see that Mr. Jeffers failed to fully research this book - the role the Sitka rescue teams played (both on the Williamsburgh and trying to assess/fight the fire on the Prinsendam) was totally overlooked - despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story - which was the human side \u0026 had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event.  I was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out, was very sad.  At least we all have our commendations from both the Coast Guard commendant and the Canadian armed services - they knew we were there!   Too bad Mr. Jeffers didn\u0027t due diligence.\n",
    "\nTropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.\n\nIn his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, \"I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is,\" \". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age,\" and \". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must.\" Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.\n\nTropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller\u0027s experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller\u0027s stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, \"A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am\"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.\n\nWhen they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as \"woman\" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the \"living,\" no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.\n\nMiller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore\u0027s mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as \". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot,\" he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.\n\nMiller\u0027s logic about the working world is facile; he writes, \"If you want bread, you\u0027ve got to get in harness, get in lockstep.\" On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren\u0027t in \"lock step,\" Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including \"the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers\"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.\n\nSeemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, \"A boy can break your heart . . . He\u0027s so damned beautiful! And so cruel!\" Miller writes, \"We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest.\" When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, \"At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good.\"\n\nShapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, \" . . . they must be saturated with my anguish,\" the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the \"inhuman ones.\" \"I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on.\" Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.\n\nTropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, \"There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America.\" If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his \"art,\" his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the \"greatest\" of these souls, may I never meet the least.\n\nNote: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it\n",
    "\nThis book was a complete waste.  It was boring to read and hard to follow.  I finished the book just see how it ended and hoping to clear up the confusion.

    "\nHave you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you wouldn\u0027t feel bad?  Have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him? In this story, the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he\u0027s still a \"good guy\" because \"good guys\" don\u0027t do bad things.  Dizzing logic, huh?  Throughout the novel, you review his senior year of high school with him.  It starts out with the story of how he got the nickname \"Killer\" to why it\u0027s okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue.  The flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he didn\u0027t rape her.  He won\u0027t let her leave the room until she believes it.  The ending is less than satisfactory for me.  I would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice\n",
    "\nJesus, talk about the little girl crying \"wolf.\" When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. \n\nThe book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We\u0027re given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.\n\nThe big story is, alas, not so impressive. It\u0027s a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, \"crashing and bleeding out,\" cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you\u0027re a PETA type.\n\nThe worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don\u0027t die at the end. Basically, he\u0027s trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you\u0027re supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you\u0027re tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you\u0027re addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax\u0027s hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you\u0027ve finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?\n\nI wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can\u0027t. Preston\u0027s ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to \"get into the minds\" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston\u0027s inability to write. \n\nIf you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot\u0027s Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you\u0027re pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom\u0027s Cabins of scientific accounting\n",
    "\nThis book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional. This is absolutely not the case.

    "\nAs a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler, this book was a BIG disappointment!!! I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadn\u0027t paid more than $1 for it. While the title \"The Unprocessed Child\" accurately describes Laurie\u0027s upbringing, this book shouldn\u0027t be grouped with other unschooling literature. The author, while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter, reminds me of the mother in \"Love You Forever\" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son\u0027s room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she\u0027s not spending 24/7 with her only child. We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them. If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter, I would recommend \"Homeschooling our Children, Unschooling Ourselves\". Those authors offer more balance and eloquence than Ms. Fitzenreiter.\n",

    "\nThis was my first reading of Jamaica Kincaid. She has a short, concise style, which made me often feel like I was reading poetry. However, I felt that it also had some downsides, like stifling character growth. In Lucy, the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters. Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much. It was  an alright quick read, but had it been longer, I doubted it would have held my attention\n",
    "\nHmmm. I\u0027m struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don\u0027t always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the \u0026quot;who, where and why\u0026quot; were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn\u0027t know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd\n",
    "\nDr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures.

Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women.  As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns.  I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research. \n",

I loved it, couldn\u0027t be more happy.\n\nWell, the day of the book\u0027s release, I took a day off work (i\u0027ve never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.\n\nWith the flag on the cover and the title of \"Let Freedom Ring,\" I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects. \n\nBoy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks. \n\nAt that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It\u0027s only now that I can bring myself to review this man\u0027s book, patriot that he is. \n\nI say this so you know what you\u0027re getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects. \n\nI have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made. \n\nThe methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest. \n\nWe found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called \"President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II.\" Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I\u0027m not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I\u0027ve draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house. \n\nNow I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.\n",
    "\nTime was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books\u0027 recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first \"Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book\" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company\u0027s kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills\u0027 products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company\u0027s bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.  \n\nThe two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you\u0027ll never see their likes again.\n\nThe current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the \"dump and stir\" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.  \n\nIt\u0027s obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can\u0027t be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The \"Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook\" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker\u0027s had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks\u0027 Illustrated/America\u0027s Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called \"The America\u0027s Test Kitchen Family Cookbook.\"  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It\u0027s a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there\u0027s even better stuff out there now.  Go for it!\n",

Alfred E. Neuman, of Mad Magazine, with his declaration of \"What, me? Worry?\" provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by Ms. LaRoche.  If you\u0027re looking for some deeper meaning to life, to success, to accomplishment, you\u0027d be much better served by reading Napoleon Hill, Anthony Robbins, Dr. Covey, Denis Waitley, or Brian Tracey. \n",

The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister, and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. Are they going to introduce a new character to be \"on to him\" every book?

My main concern is what worked for him probably won\u0027t work for someone reading this book.\n\nThis book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do. He made so many changes on the medications and supplements, it is hard to say what worked.\n\nOne can find the general imformation presented in this book on \"Diet\", \"Exercise\" and \"Stress management\" (relating to clog arteries \u0026 heart diseases) through the internet.

    "\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Josh Harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young Christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene. However, he doesn\u0027t seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  Either he\u0027s guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become. \n\nIs it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  No.  For the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  Few couples have actually gotten together this way.\n\nThe real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN, as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.  Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that \"rises to the top\" for Christian singles.\n\nBecause Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from \"God\u0027s plan\" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  Unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of \"passive Christian guy thing\", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it\u0027s New York City, Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.  It\u0027s not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.\n\nAnd so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single Christian men, who they greatly outnumber.  Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.  Which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a Christian singleness industry with its own slogan \"The Gift of Singleness\" that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!  Of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don\u0027t add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.  But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that\u0027s the result of the Christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there\u0027ll always be a market for Christian self-help books like this one.  Pure genius!\n\nWhat\u0027s more, there are \"unintended consequences\" that can go along with Harris\u0027 model for \"courtship\" that he doesn\u0027t really address:\n\n1) Because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy\u0027s intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him. This can have several sub-consequences: \n(a) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your \"potential marriage proposal\" crash and burn!) (b) It fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is \"the one\", he might not ever do it (c) Ironically, it can boost up the guy\u0027s expectations in terms of a woman\u0027s looks. Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman I want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don\u0027t LOOK like whatever their \"wife prototype\" might be. Guys who date and don\u0027t make a big deal of \"a date\" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (In \"How to Get a Date Worth Keeping\", Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren\u0027t really \"their type\" when they first met). \n2) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides. Serial dating (as practiced in Latin American countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a \"short-list\") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex. You ask your way down your \"ladder of options\" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who\u0027s asking and who\u0027s not). With courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years. The idea that it\u0027s better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is FALSE. You\u0027re better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence! \n3) It reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex. It reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles. \n4) It\u0027s unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who\u0027s had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested. Most Christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage. \n5) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like. Kind of like, \"he\u0027s a nice, sincere, Christian guy and he wouldn\u0027t be spending this kind of time with me if he didn\u0027t think of me as marriage material, right?\"...not always so. \n\nIf we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn\u0027t gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time. Maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today\u0027s Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about \"the gift of singleness\" and the shortage of men. I would recommend Debbie Maken\u0027s Getting Serious about Getting Married: Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy.\n",
    "\nIn addition to the errors listed by others, I see missing letters in the middle of words, quote marks that are the wrong style (backticks instead of curly quotes, done inconsistently), inconsistent indentations ... it\u0027s a typesetting nightmare.  Big disappointment\n",
    "\nI found this book embarrassing to read - not because it\u0027s risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French \u0026 Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality. \n\nIt\u0027s also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.\n\nEverything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the \"mental life\" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence\u0027s own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of \"woman\" or \"man\"; and so on. \n\nLooking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.\n\nReading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what\u0027s \"wrong\" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn\u0027t really seem happier now that she\u0027s sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing \"that kind\" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there\u0027s something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence\u0027s view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors\u0027 equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author\u0027s hostility toward \"druglike\" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.\n\nHilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a \"user\", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn\u0027t mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a \"user\".) \n\nIt\u0027s actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one\u0027s body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex. \n\nThis is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a \"real\" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples. \n\nA woman who lays there \"unfeeling\" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn\u0027t even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn\u0027t doing could even be related; it\u0027s presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.\n\nOn the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he\u0027s premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it\u0027s women in general and especially Mellor\u0027s Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he \"spoilt\" her. \n\nAs for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn\u0027t need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she\u0027s what she ought to be, she\u0027ll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.\n\nThese were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman\u0027s duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she\u0027s supposed to (and if she doesn\u0027t, it\u0027s her own fault); while a man\u0027s job is to climb on top and \"perform\". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman\u0027s vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there\u0027s a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part. \n\nWomen have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men \"want to hear\". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being \"sexist\". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not \"come to the crisis\" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman\u0027s doing and had nothing at all to do with the man. \n\nIt\u0027s also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn\u0027t already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or \u0027what a woman ought to be\u0027 emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as \"intimacy\" and \"connection\", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man\u0027s biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child. \n\nSo - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it\u0027s not so clearly obvious that a woman \"should\" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence\u0027s open belittling of women whose emotional states don\u0027t match masculine emotional detachment and distance.\n\nThere\u0027s a lot of talk of \"tenderness\" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow \"lacking tenderness\" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find. \n\nI can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she\u0027s a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won\u0027t say and the questions he won\u0027t answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.\n\nFor what it\u0027s worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I\u0027d call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not.\n",

    "\nLets say you were reading a book on the mafia, written by John Gotti, or perhaps some lesser-known mobster.  And there was nothing but glowing accolades for the mob and it\u0027s activities.  Furthermore, anyone who opposed the mafia and it\u0027s activities was labeled an \"extremist\" and in the text, their names were never more than about 4 or 5 words away from words like \"Ku Klux Klan,\" \"racist,\" \"bigoted,\" or \"paranoid,\" you\u0027d begin to suspect that the book was a bit biased, wouldn\u0027t you?\n\n\"Americas Uncivil Wars\" is a book written by Mark Lytle, a professor at Bard College.  He documents events in American History, in this book, from the 1950\u0027s to about 1975.  Practically every time a genuine conservative individual, or organization is mentioned in this book, it is associated to a racist organization, whenever Mr. Lytle doesn\u0027t add his own commentary.  For example, on page 22, he says Joseph McCarthy revealed himself as a \"mean-spirited slob.\"  This is a far cry from the McCarthy I know, the McCarthy who wrote the brilliant \"Americas Retreat from Victory\" for example.  And forget about anything good mentioned about the John Birch Society.  Page 138: \"Most Americans ignored the hooded Klansmen, the John Birchers, and other extremists...\"  never mind the fact that JBS is not and never was a racist or an extremist organization.  But here is their name, sandwiched between the KKK and \"extremist.\"\n\nIt is a typical tactic of the left to associate the opposition with the \"stench of racism\" as Stalin may have put it (I don\u0027t remember his exact quote).  But you might ask, what about on page 89 where he refers glowingly to William F. Buckley as \"the cornerstone of the anti-communist wing of conservatism...?\"  Keep in mind that this is the same Buckley who years later, in Lingua Franca magazine, confessed that he would be a \"Mike Harrington Socialist\" or a \"Communist\" if he were college brat today. \n\nNow on the other hand, try to find anywhere in this book, the words \"murderer,\" or even \"extremist\" in front of names like Mao Tse Tung, or Che Guevara or Tom Hayden, to name a few.

She did several long train commutes a week to and from work, and so read a lot of novels.  Anyway, I started describing this book.  She recognized it immediately, and interrupted me saying, \u0026quot;The Bear Went Over The Mountain!  Don\u0027t read another word!  If you think it\u0027s bad now, it only gets worse, if you can believe it!\u0026quot;  She was right.  If you feel the need to find out for yourself, save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library\n",
    "\nJoseph Nye keeps repeating himself: multilateralism by global American charm attack. That is simply a stupid assumption. And it is untrue of American history in foreign relations.

    "\nI found the book thought-provoking, but there is more to philosophy than provocation. The common underlying argument of this book, and its only valid statement as ethics, is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior, the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in. This results-oriented approach is all very well, but Singer doesn\u0027t really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument. Virtually all of Singer\u0027s arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept. If you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument; if you don\u0027t accept the premise, its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion. In short, these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline. How useful you find this is up to you. I personally don\u0027t know Singer from Adam and had not received any prior indoctrination about how groundbreaking he was before I picked up the book; as a result, I have trouble seeing what people are so excited about\n",

    "\nI originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled \"This is a racist book disguised as a work of art.\"  It seems that I didn\u0027t explain well enough my objection to Styron\u0027s co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, \"The Confessions of Nat Turner,\" by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray\u0027s book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.  \n\nUnlike his depiction in Styron\u0027s book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron\u0027s invention of Turner\u0027s pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray\u0027s account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner\u0027s life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.\n\nDo those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner\u0027s fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner\u0027s skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner\u0027s life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron\u0027s version of Turner\u0027s life, taken by many readers as fact.\n\nIf one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of \"Confessions.\"  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray\u0027s book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron\u0027s book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching\n",
    "\nI really love Amanda Quick, but this one just didn\u0027t work. We don\u0027t even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they\u0027ve already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.\n\nAnd I don\u0027t really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. It\u0027s never explained why the first murder even occurs. The hero\u0027s fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she\u0027s using the last name \"Jones\" is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. But JONES?!\n\nAll would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn\u0027t in the slightest. I will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library\n",

    "\nThis novel of a 17th century samurai\u0027s odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It\u0027s certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don\u0027t really have much experience of Japan, think they\u0027ve stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai\u0027s sword\n",
    "\nIt took me a year to finally complete this book.  And honestly, the only reason I completed it was because I had nothing else on my bookshelf to read.  This book dragged on and on to the tiny climax about 5 pages from the end.  What a waste of such a beautiful book cover.  Do not waste a year of your life or a dime of your money\n",
    "\nThe book had so much promise, but I find it to be disappointing in several ways, alas.  The recipes I\u0027ve tried have been delicious, and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative, although the discussions and instructions don\u0027t rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool, as would, for example, anything by Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, Jacques Pepin, or any of the King Arthur Flour baking cookbooks, all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes.  In this case, I was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before I bought the book.  Were I a tyro, I don\u0027t think this book would be the best introduction, although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying.\n\nMy biggest disappointment, though, is the organization of the book:  ice cream recipes are \"bundled\" with their accompanying cookies, garnishes, and the like; instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream, for example, we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches, with ice cream of any of several different flavor families.  One has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find, say, recipes for chocolate ice cream.  I would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes, by flavor and page number, right up front -- I don\u0027t want to spend so much time looking for the flavor I want.  \n\nMy next disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically attractive and most stylish but virtually illegible size and color.  My middle-aged eyes struggle desperately to read the book, even with my reading glasses on, and I surely can\u0027t prop the book 18-20\" back from my utensils, to read as I work without changing position, as I like to do with my cookbooks.  This is a case in which the author and editorial team seemed to have chosen (admittedly very attractive) style over function.  The book IS very attractive, and the photographs are lovely -- but I would gladly sacrifice some beauty in favor of being able to read the recipes and discussions more easily.\n\nMy final disappointment is in the complexity and elaborateness of most of the \"dessert packages,\" for lack of a better word.  Making the ice cream or sorbet and its accoutrements is, in most cases, a tremendously labor-intensive exercise.  I have opted for using some of the creative and delicious ice cream recipes and figuring out my own much simpler and easier garnishes and accompaniments.  I work a demanding job and have a house to run.  I love to cook, but can\u0027t devote as much time to making an ice cream sandwich, for example, as these recipes require.  So I use less of the book than I\u0027d wish.\n\nOver all, Ms. Luchetti\u0027s sense of style and taste are impressive, and she seems superbly knowledgeable about frozen desserts.  And many of the ice cream recipes are lovely.  But I had hoped that this would be a book I would pull from the shelf much more often than I will, in fact, because the book is so difficult to use\n",

Then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids, with no plot development.

The only sexy scene is on page 138, and that\u0027s not very good either.  \n\nThe best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve used the lonely planet guides on other trips before, and have always been very pleased, but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth.  LP was the only guide we purchased, based on our previous experiences with them, but we had the chance to peruse others in the B\u0026B\u0027s we stayed in throughout our trip.  Of all of them, I\u0027d rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say, individual experiences may vary!  Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination, so upon reflection, we would have been happier with the Rough Guide.  LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide, and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process.  I hate to say it, but I\u0027d rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best.  I\u0027d still put it above most of the other guidebooks though.\n\nOur first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are.  I realize it was published two years ago, but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20% more than LP listed.  That\u0027s quite a jump for 2 years, indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition, or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update.\n\nOur second gripe was the local maps.  They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities, and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones.  Given the rarity of Irish street signage, those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns.  Also, and this may be a function of the 2003 printing, a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers, and LP\u0027s maps rarely identified this.  \n\nA third, again related gripe is with the existance, or lack thereof, of the various restaurants, b\u0026b\u0027s, shops, etc. listed in the guide.  Probably 30% of the restaurants in the guide just aren\u0027t there any more.  I realize they must have been when it went to print, but that didn\u0027t help us any.\n\nOur last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country.  Granted, it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts, pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas.  Unfortunately, we didn\u0027t just want to go where all the other tourists go, so this left our noses still further out of joint.\n\nOverall, I\u0027d say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well, both LP and Rough Guide do that.  If you want to keep the expenditures down, Rough Guide does it much better.  If you want to go all out, um, there\u0027s probably a third option, but neither of these two will do it well.  If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others, then this guide is the closest you\u0027ll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although, in that case, I\u0027d really recommend getting two guides, one for each end of the spectrum.\n\nOne last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle/tomb/historic place!  If you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places, its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip\n",

Many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers--Rousseau, for example.

Therefore, the redeeming value is found, perhaps, in Freud\u0027s closing passages, eery portends of Europe\u0027s ugly years\n",
    "\nUnfortunately some audio books are read in monotone-very dull indeed-but in this audio book the reader goes too far in the opposite direction by reading an adult book as if it\u0027s story time and she\u0027s a preschool teacher. \n\nMy daughters and I loved the main characters in audio books such as Bridget Jones Diary, The Nanny Diaries, and Sammy\u0027s Hill because the reader made us sympathize with them.

Emily Gray, the reader of Can You Keep a Secret, made the main character sound witless and very, very phony. All of the other characters sounded one dimensional.\n\nWe listen to audio books on our frequent long car trips. Although we had nothing else to listen to at the time, we could only stand  of this book before we had to turn it off. A few weeks later I randomly read a few chapters of Can You Keep a Secret in a bookstore and thought that it was amusing. Perhaps Emily Gray didn\u0027t find the book amusing, so she thought that she needed to go \"over the top\" to add humor. If so, it didn\u0027t work.

While they try to add a personal touch by including individual narrations, it sounds more like a compilation of uneducated people describing their birth stories the way they were pressured to believe---NOBODY mentions feeling pain during labor. Honestly, I feel that the pressure of the community was so intense they wouldn\u0027t have admitted to pain if they could.\n\nAlso, many of the accounts were extremely erotic---couple are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep connected and relaxed.

    "\nThere is no measure how harmful and disastrous this \"sermon\" has been to all who have read or heard it.  The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a \"hell\".  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  \"Hell\" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and \"converting\" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as \"orthodox\" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young\u0027s Literal propagate this fallacy.\n\nDo your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.

    "\nThis book belongs in the Fantasy section of the library.\n\nLet\u0027s start with the question of Israel\u0027s borders.  Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers?  After all, Israel is kind of small.  Doesn\u0027t it need, um, a tiny bit more land?\n\nWell, Israel may need a little more land.  But almost nobody is proposing anything like this.  I see very few Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank, let alone all of Jordan.  And as for the Nile to the Euphrates, this is pretty much exclusively anti-Zionist propaganda.  There\u0027s a nice article by Daniel Pipes in the March, 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail, in case anyone cares.\n\nYes, we\u0027ve seen propaganda before.  In the 1930s, some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the whole world.  Now, what do we see in this book?\n\nWhat we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows state-funded religious schools to preach that Jewish rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates.  Is there any connection between this and truth?\n\nYes, there\u0027s a connection.  You see, in the Bible (in Deuteronomy), Moses says at one point that Israel\u0027s borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the \"western sea\" (presumably, the Mediterranean, but definitely not the Nile).  Of course, someone might want to ask a Jewish authority about what the Bible says.  It turns out that there\u0027s much more detailed material in the Book of Numbers, and that is what Pipes says religious Jews are taught is Biblical.  And that specifies a much smaller Israel.  In addition, it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders, no matter how large or small, to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today.  Hedges is doing us a big disservice here.  You may want to check all this for yourselves.\n\nIn addition, Hedges has an exciting description of the Battle of Khafji (which took place during Desert Storm).  Some people who were really there dispute it, however.  You may want to check that as well.\n\nWe also see Hedges describe the behavior of Israeli soldiers in Gaza on June 17, 2001.  Now, remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders.  Their superiors know that Israel can\u0027t afford unnecessary violence.  The soldiers are there to protect lives, not to hurt or kill others.  And in fact, it turns out to be true that in the fighting between Jews and Arabs, the Jews (as expected) have rarely been guilty of gratuitous violence.  On the other hand, the Arabs, who have rather different goals and constraints, have displayed quite a bit of bad behavior.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of logic and facts to the contrary, in this book, Hedges comes up with the following (as usual, I encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is, and you might want to start by finding out how many people died that day and who they were):\n\n\"I had seen children shot in other conflicts that I had covered - death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala, mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria, and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo - but I had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport.\"\n\nWell!  What is it about Israelis that could lead them to behave in such a surprising manner?  Hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of nasty reading material about the Holocaust has perverted these unfortunate young men.  Well, I\u0027m perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material.  But I don\u0027t buy Hedges\u0027 absurd conclusion at all.  Nor do I buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers.  And no, I\u0027m not in denial.  If you believe Hedges, I think you may be in denial, though!\n\nI\u0027ll stop here.  Anyone capable of saying what I\u0027ve quoted from Hedges so far is capable of saying anything.  We readers do not need this.\n",

    "\nThe most disappointing thing about The News from Paraguay is the beginning, and not precisely because is a bad one, but because in the first chapters of Lily Tuck National Prize awarded novel,  there\u0027s a hint that  could have been better than it turn out to be.\nSo I confess that  for a few pages (those that engage a reader with a book) I found  charming the decimononic  story of Ella Lynch, a beautiful widow living in Paris well beyond her means. That even when  Ella decided to follow hairy Franco -a paraguayan stud- not because his looks, not even for this foolish thing called love, but because  he smelled like luxury and power in a faraway land; I still found it a joyable read,  but right when she arrived to her privileged life of  \"querida\"  of the most powerful man in Paraguay and began to have one baby after another in tumultuous times,  The News from Paraguay became boring and I began to skip entire paragraphes until I got to a previsible end.\nBased on true facts, the life of a Paraguayan dictator and his irish  mistress; Tuck, who confessed that she never went and wasn\u0027t interested in ever going to Paraguay (i think she finally did) can\u0027t even get the spanish names right: Mauel, instead of Manuel, Rosaria, instead of Rosario; Iez, instead o Ins.

    "\nThroughout my read, my head kept shaking with disappointment.  If the \u0026quot;renaissance\u0026quot; of hard SF relies on stories a full decade, even two decades, old, then the genre\u0027s future is feebly fixated on its past.  Not to say that some of the stories here aren\u0027t wonderful ... emphasis on \u0026quot;some.\u0026quot;  But dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard SF fails to deliver on the title\u0027s promise.  This is more nostalgia than renewal, and you should read a library-borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past/passing.  But don\u0027t drop any real money expecting a glimpse into Sci-Fi\u0027s future\n",
    "\nThe book is written about an empire in the future.  I\u0027m not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic.  I know this is nit-picking, but I didn\u0027t like this book.  \n\nApparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics.  Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it\u0027s difficult to predict what\u0027s going to happen in anyone\u0027s life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.\n\nThis book is intellectual worship, which is something I can\u0027t stand.  Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them.  This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude.  This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable.  Another idea that\u0027s patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.\n\nIf this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn\u0027t he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization.  Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.\n\nAnd Asimov is a mediocre writer.  The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed.  I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated\n",

    "\nWhile this book put together by the Detroit Free Press has action photos, they are some of the most disappointing pictures i\u0027ve ever seen in a book about a team\u0027s season. Where are the photos of Tiger players actually hitting a baseball? If you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne, talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles, then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself, be prepared to be frustrated. I much preferred the photograhy in the George Cantor paperback \"Out of Nowhere\" The Detroit Tigers\u0027 Magical 2006 Season. I know that this volume covers the Play-offs and World Series whereas the Cantor book doesn\u0027t, but it\u0027s photo collection is poor, the photos in the Cantor book are superb. If you are a Tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much, (the writing and articles are quite good at least)but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of Tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc. Very disappointing, worth only 2 stars\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve read five of the nine \"Temperance Brennan\" mysteries that Kathy Reichs has published, but this is my least favorite. I lost interest about two-thirds through. I felt the villains were not fleshed-out, the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely, the ending too neatly contrived, and the personal/romantic side story too awkward. This one was also too long, by about 50 pages. Reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients, yet they did not blend into a successful flavor. The other four of her novels were fine. I love the TV series as well, although \"Bones\" allegedly shows Dr. Brennan much earlier in her career, with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books. In the TV series, \"Dr. Brennan\" has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly. In the books, her lesser characters all seem...lesser, indeed. Better luck next time out, Dr. Reichs\n",

    "\nPirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of \"real\" child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son\u0027s murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsig\u0027s son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.  \nIf you are one of the poor souls who finds something \"deep\" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent\n",
    "\nThe premise of the store is interesting.  How did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football?  The first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons.  (West Coast offense, LT, etc.)  \n\nUnfortunately, at that point Lewis runs out of things to write about, so he starts talking about Michael Oher, an O Lineman at Ole Miss.  Oher\u0027s story is intersting, but it is too early to tell.  He is a \"superstar\" but only a sophomore.  I also think that Lewis overdoes how great Oher already is.  \n\nI also don\u0027t really understand what Oher\u0027s story really had to do with the original premise of the book.  Is Lewis saying that because left tackles now make millions, Oher wants to be one?  I would think that if Oher had come around in the 70s people would still have thought of him as a football player.  Last time I checked lineman were big and strong (and quick) in that era too. \n",

    "\nI picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.\n\nI went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.\n\nAnyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I\u0027m not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.\n\nNow here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.\n\nBut you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.\n\nBut! I liked the parts I read \"okay\" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it\u0027s missing TWO STARS if it ends well.\n\nLesson learned is life is not always fair but you \"keep on keepin on\" like they say\n",
    "\nTo say Christianity will die is to say that one can see the end of the world. Purely craziness. Christianity will live as long as the world exists.

Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all.

    "\nWhile I found this book interesting and informative when it dwelled upon the personalities and contributions of the physicists who discovered and explored the field of quantum mechanics prior to WW2, I found two problems with the book as it entered the war.  First, it spent too much time, at least for me, on the details of minor episodes and players.  In this sense, I might have appreciated the treatment had I been a scholar researching the field - but I wasn\u0027t.  Hence, I often found the reading dull.  Second, I found Powers\u0027 ultimate thesis - that Heisenberg purposefully delayed the German atomic bomb program - unpersuasive.  It appeared to me that Powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis.  For example, when reviewing Heisenberg\u0027s \"Farm Hall\" statement in August 1945 that two tons of U235 was required to make an atomic bomb, Powers suggests that because Heisenberg articulated the appropriate lesser amount a week later,  and because he purportedly suggested at an earlier date that a bomb could be the size of a football, his \"two ton\" statement was a purposeful \"error.\" Equally persuasive, if not more, is the simple thought that Heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required, thereby prompting him to tell Speer in 1942 that a bomb was impractical. This is not to say that Powers is necessarily wrong.  I simply believe that based on the facts he presents, the issue remains debatable\n",

    "\nEarlier this year I reviewed what many will see as the companion volume to this book (\"Photoshop Blending Modes Cookbook for Digital Photographers\"), written by the same author. Unfortunately, the newer publication is less useful. It seems to have been written on a pretext that it\u0027s clever to be able to duplicate what traditional artists can do. This seems - from my own personal viewpoint - to be greatly undervaluing the power of Photoshop (and similar software). Practitioners of digital fine art should (really, constructively) be looking to explore what the principles of prior and traditional art can mean within a new domain.\n\nPlus, the book gets off to a definitely poor start. The second and longer of two introductory sections is titled \"The Tricks of the Trade\". Well it would be better if just some of the \"tricks\" had been explained in full and more accurately.  Say, how to make a selection in Photoshop from the best available precursor (a black-and-white alpha channel). Or say again, how to make tonal corrections to the original photograph using a luminance mask. Then again, the first (and shorter) of the introductory chapters, titled \"The Artist\u0027s Eye\", is just a teaser. This topic - pre-visualizing what can be achieved as an output image when composing the original photographic input - could have benefited from a much more detailed explanation/argument. Indeed, it could even merit an expansive concluding chapter (but the book doesn\u0027t have one of those at all ....). This is, after all, at the very core of what the user could harness to any given artistic objective.\n\nAdditionally, I think that it\u0027s strange that a book such as this simply makes no reference at all to what could be printed from the recipes it contains. Some of the finished (output) images might look quite intriguing as 3 by 5 inch reproductions in the book - but does the methodology hold up if you\u0027re targeting a 20 by 36 inch output (say) on a large format printer? And what to do if that\u0027s not the case? Finally, and in common with the earlier companion volume, this book suffers from strange and inconsistent layouts of screenshots and text, plus all sorts of technical and editing omissions/errors (which include, for example, having the wrong screenshot in the wrong recipe - see p.108)\n",
    "\nThis book is not worth wasting your money on.  The techniques that are represented look OK to the untrained eye, but if you examine them closely, you will notice many mistakes.  The techniques are sparse, one per angle.  They are also demonstrated with poor posture and attack.  To the novice,  this book may appear to represent the art of Cabales Serrada Escrima, but  it does not.  More than half of the book is unrelated to the system of  Serrada. This book does nothing to show the effectiveness of Cabales  Serrada Escrima\n",

    "\ni was more than willing to give None Dare Call It Treason a chance, as i found the scale of Stormer\u0027s research impressive. However, the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive Communist takeover in America came to pass, coupled with his outspoken admiration for McCarthy and truly insane predictions like this:\n\n\"Once the takeover comes, you, like millions of others, who believe in God and man\u0027s responsibility for his own actions, can be slaughtered like diseased animals or worked to death in slave labor camps or brothels for the Red Army.\" p. 20\n\nhave forced me to conclude that Stormer\u0027s thesis was overwhelmingly incorrect. Perhaps the most irritating part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly pro-Communist. The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in American high school classes rather undermines his argument.\nthe sad thing is, because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched, it is far too dry to be amusing, even when read ironically. and ironic amusement is the only positive product of propaganda.\nin closing, i would take Communism over John A. Stormer\u0027s America any day\n",

    "\nI recently picked up a copy of Mage: The Awakening not knowing quite what to expect. Since Ars Magica I\u0027ve loved Mage. From GURPs I quickly switched over to White Wolf\u0027s editions of Mage: The Ascension, finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today.\n\nMage: The Ascension Revised was truly a delight, featuring a complexity never seen before in role playing games. A complexity that made working magic truly fun, sure there were flaws, without a good Storyteller you could easily abuse the open ended magic system to do absolutely anything you wanted... but it was a good price to pay for flexibility, interesting possibilities and an all around great RP system.\n\nIs it fair to compare Mage: The Awakening with Mage: The Ascension Revised? Of course not, the game has to be based on its own merits and flaws. The problem is that this game seems to suffer from a lack of creativity which pervades the RP modern RP market. It also seems to be marketed toward a very specific audience.\n\nWith the exception of some really interesting RP books (White Wolf\u0027s translation of \"Engel\" from the German, a role playing experience distinct onto itself and wholly creative, and \"Demon: The Fallen\" - which was unfortunately a flop and still managed to be creative), RP books are typically very bland and all the same. \n\nMage: The Awakening is no different. Unfortunately it tries to blend easy mechanics with simple spells as though past Mage books have been too complicated (which they haven\u0027t, unless the new World of Darkness market is much younger than they previously were... which is a possibility, or perhaps they aren\u0027t interested in realistic depth so much as they are just having quick fun). \n\nThere is absolutely nothing culturally significant about the Mage: The Awakening game system. If you enjoyed the Buddhist, Hindu, the various forms of Christian, Judaic and other religious outlooks being present in your game system, Mage: The Awakening takes a step back from the pluralism/intellectually stimulating material found in its predecessors and offers a quick, fun system with no lasting appeal.\n\nThe background story of Mage: The Awakening is simply terrible. Sure reviews constantly pick on Atlantis, but for a good reason: there\u0027s simply nothing else to pick on! The Awakening is simply devoid of any depth whatsoever, but what it does do is provide some interesting magic rotes (spells) instead.\n\nAnother problem is that there are no antagonists. In previous Mage games there were antagonists you could use or not use depending on your game. In Awakening they don\u0027t even offer any choices. This game is obviously less popular online and more popular in tabletop settings (online, where depth is usually called for, Mage: The Ascension is still used quite frequently).\n\nSome positive qualities about the book are that it has an excellent production value and it provides a concrete game system to play with. Provided you had an excellent Storyteller present with lots of storyline ideas, you might have a fun tabletop session. But quite frankly aside from the production value I can\u0027t recommend this book. The largest problem of all is that it simply has nothing distinctive about it... nothing to make it stand out and be worth playing over previous game systems.\n\nIn an age of simplicity please do yourself a favor and have a little patience and find yourself a good Storyteller. Go back and read the books that made this one sell like hotcakes - buy the \"real\" Mage books - if you still want to, pick up a copy of The Awakening and somehow incorporate it in your game\n",
    "\nWhite Wolf wanted to revitalize a mature product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the old system that deserved fixing. They did an excellent job on the core rules and the game mechanics are overall the best they\u0027ve ever been. \nOne of the flaws of MAGE:Ascension was that it is dominated by the struggle between the Technocracy and the Traditions, in a manner that reflected Vampire:Masquerade\u0027s clan structure and Sabbat vs Camarilla. One of the flaws of Vampire:Masquerade was that it had this whole history of \"Caine as the first vampire and the Anti-Diluvians as the founders of the clans\", that overshadowed the game. \nIn Mage:Ascension, Mages saw themselves as having evolved over time and that history had been re-written by the technocracy, so who really knew about the past? \nIn Awakening they took exactly what they were trying to jettison from Vampire and put it into Mage with the creation of Atlantis and the Exarchs. The Societies that replace the traditions are not as interesting. The replacement of Avatars with Towers doesn\u0027t make sense to me. The eternal struggle theme remains with the Exarchs but seems a lot less important than the struggle over the consensus in Ascension.\nAwakening is chock full or rotes. For, Mage in a LARP, rotes are essential, shifting emphasis to rotes improves the compatibility of table top and live action systems, but detracts from the table top experience where Mages can do almost anything. They split the Entropy Sphere into Death and Fate, which kind of makes sense, except that Death has too much overlap with Spirit. \nI\u0027m going to use the new Mechanics with the old world in my new campaign.\nThe new Mage setting doesn\u0027t inspire me like the old one did. While the new Vampire and Werewolf settings may catch on, I think the new Mage is going to be a flop -- after the core book I don\u0027t expect to purchase any more of the supplements.\n",

    "\nIf your into Hendrix enough to want to find out more about Electric Ladyland, your probably already going to know everything in this book.

The author makes big calls in this book which fall flat, for example expressing his view on how Jimi could of edited and recorded certain songs better in his opinion (not unlike like Alan Douglas made true) or ego trips like footnotes after mentioning \u0027Like A Rolling Stone\u0027 at Monterey can only be outdone by the rare hard to find Flamingo Club version in 1968 - where does he get that from? The Flamingo club version is near inaudiable for most of the recording with its vocals and the guitar very distorted at the very least and is no way a superior rendition than Monterey but the book has many little comments by the author like that which only makes you think, is this guy trying to brag about his Hendrix collection? Or does he just have to have a different opinion on everything to try and make his book, which really has nothing new, stand out from the pack? His opinions would be valid if he didn\u0027t try to go against the grain to just go against the grain! If you\u0027ve ever heard or seen Jimi at Monterey you don\u0027t need to be told how so many people thought he played crap that night - the evidence that this is one of his greatest performances is right there on CD or on the screen as you watch it which just makes bringing up that negative side without balancing it with the many rave reviews he also got seem targeted. Why point out the bad things and not mention the good?\n\nIf you want to learn the technical side of the recording or the technical side of Hendrix, you won\u0027t learn it from this book.

I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, \"why did I read this?\"  I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the \"punishments\" just ridiculous.  I\u0027m pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me.  Ninah\u0027s relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book.

    "\nI am a long-time admirer of Claire McNab\u0027s writing -- despite the fact I have been disappointed in the direction (or lack of it) in which she has taken the Carol Ashton mystery series. Although she is more known in the U.S. for her mystery and espionage books, her novel \"Under the Southern Cross\" is a bang-up, great romance delivered in her typically spare (or is it stingy?) style. I was excited to see she had written another romance and not a mystery with a 10-second sex scene thrown in. But, when I got to the last line of this book I found myself closing it and thinking that I had once again been suckered by past memories of Claire McNab. \nThis book has a lot of promise to it -- therefore the two stars I gave it -- but it\u0027s promise unfulfilled. There is a long setup of the writer Vonny Smith pining for the personal attention of her editor, Diana. But, why exactly is she in love with Diana? Darn if I know. The writing has great humor and spoofs the whole genre of romance novels. But the entire novel is a setup and, in the end, there is no delivery. It\u0027s annoying, frustrating, and feels like a cheat. Wasn\u0027t there an editor to say: \"Claire, this story needs more!\" Or was Bella Books just intent on cashing in on Ms. McNab\u0027s name? Who knows. But, this is one book I won\u0027t be rereading. I wish I hadn\u0027t paid full-price\n",

    "\nA book on the theme of having the courage to deepen family ties.  That\u0027s a good theme.  However, the author can\u0027t leave well enough alone.  He really goes after people without kids as though they all, regardless of their circumstances, remind him of his former self:  someone with too much cynicism and cowardice to raise a family even though that\u0027s obviously the \"only\" way to become a complete person.  \n\nEach chapter introduces a family and a crisis.  The people, who range from southern Americans to Turkish Muslims to Protestant Irish in Belfast, are terrific.  \n\nBut the author goes off the deep end on page 47:  \"Now there are cities full of professional women and men who wholeheartedly echo this feeling [not wanting children].  They go around saying things like I\u0027m too selfish to be a mother, or I\u0027m not a baby person, or my favorite, I love my life too much to do that to it.  A friend of mine calls them the Petrified Forest - people who would freeze their life in time if they could.  \u0027Manhattan\u0027s turning into a Petrified Forest,\u0027 my friend mocked.  I [Bronson] winced when she said this, because I used to be one of them.  When the Petrified Forest imagines parenthood, their hearts are flooded with the feeling of doors closing, not opening ... In our society today, parenthood is on trial.\"  \n\nWell, hardly.  Bronson is making a lot of assumptions about childless people.  Everyone doesn\u0027t need to have a baby just because Bronson found it a refreshing alternative to preserving his immaturity.  I\u0027m all for individuals pursuing the particular life that makes them happy, but they should never push their specific solution upon the rest of us.  In conclusion, read this book if you want to, but be aware of the bias.\n",

Anyway, I was real disappointed. I quit paying attention after page 100 and quit outright a few pages later.  I found the contrasting aspects of the Father\u0027s character interesting but after awhile so contrasting they felt way off reality.  Character of aunt, cousin, priest, mom etc etc also grew gratingly \"perfect.\"  This  may be excessive, but after a while I felt like I was reading a bit of sophisticated version of a teen romance novel.  The comparisons with God of Small Things are seriously unflattering to Roy\u0027s great book.

    "\nThe subtitle to this review should have been \"Glaring Inconsistencies \u0026 Outright Fantasies\". I\u0027ve found a large number of inconsistencies with history that should be obvious to anyone who has read this thing closely. For example, on page 7 Coleman says \"the Club of Rome was established in 1968\", but on page 17 he suggests that the Club of Rome played \"a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis\" and \"attempted to sell its \u0027crisis management\u0027...progam to President Kennedy.\"  Unless we\u0027ve been misled, the Cuban Missile Crisis happened a full 6 years before this group was founded.  What are careful readers to make of such a passage? Either it\u0027s a typo and he means 1958, or, as I heartily suspect, he doesn\u0027t have a grasp on his subject.  On page 9 Coleman suggests Henry \"Kissinger\u0027s role in destabilizing the United States by three wars, the Middle East, Korea, and Vietnam is well known...\" However, Kissinger, working at Harvard from 1948, had no role in the U.S. government until the 1960\u0027s, working for the Kennedy Administration.  The Korean War, as we are all aware, occured in 1950, and ended long before Kissinger had any influence on American foreign policy.  If it were true that Kissinger had an influence on the United States\u0027 policy in Korea, for example, then Coleman would be wise to address that issue at this point in his text. However, he only leaves us with the cryptic \"is well known\". It is definitely NOT well known, and Coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is difficult to read or which is discussing difficult subjects must be true.\nThese are just a few of the inconsistencies that I could check in a short time that Coleman throws out at you. If you\u0027re not a careful reader, you\u0027ll be tricked into accepting some really ridiculous ideas.  If you prefer speculation to reason, then by all means gorge yourself in the sickly sweet nectar of \"what ifs\". If you\u0027re looking for something based on reality, then, rider, pass by\n",
    "\nIt would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell\u0027s reasoning, but to make a few points:\n\n1. He implies that female \u0027circumcision\u0027 is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? It\u0027s for protection? What, or whose, interests are being protected? \n\n2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical?\n\n3. The male \u0027instinct\u0027 to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed \u0027instinct to protect\u0027. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs? \n\n4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women. \n\n5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females don\u0027t know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.\n\n6. This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power. Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women. \n\n7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don\u0027t sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women. There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn\u0027t rejected. Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention.\n\n8. It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females. For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible. To argue that they have is Farrell\u0027s most ludicrous argument. Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children. The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding. They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality. It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids.\n\nThis book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women. Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the \u0027power\u0027 being defined is reproduction. \nIn a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring. Embedded in Farrell\u0027s books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to \u0027put out\u0027 more. It\u0027s the same old male longing for \u0027free\u0027 sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females.\n\nIn nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior. Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare. Reduce testosterone? Or is that blasphemy? \nThe new question is What do men want? The answer is the same as ever - sex. The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell\u0027s ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation.\nPerhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart. \nAt least let\u0027s not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest. How gullible does Farrell hope we are\n",

    "\nFirst off, I have not read this book myself, so disreguard this review if you want. I\u0027m reviewing it because based on the reviews and what I can tell here, and from descriptions from my own mother, I believe this is the book she used in a failed attempt to potty-train me. I am 99% sure, but she does not remember the title so I can\u0027t be 100% sure.\nMy mother described a system where she devoted one day to nothing but potty-training. She got everyone else out of the house, and removed all my toys from eyesight. Then she went through a detailed explanation using a potty doll and had me try to explain it back, using the doll. She then showed me what looked like a whole kitchen full of little toys and candy, and told me I would get rewarded for using the potty that day. I remember all that part. After that she said that we went through a process where she had to scold me for accidents and we did nothing but try to go potty all day. I was definately old enough to be doing this, because I actually remember it. (I am 25 now, so if this book was published in the late 70s or early 80s, I\u0027m being accurate.)\nNow, let me tell you the results. I don\u0027t remember how I felt that day, but I do know that it started something that became a huge emotional battle for me. I was a very sensitive child, and I am a very sensitive adult. What mom and I remember was that potty-training became a war in our home- and it took YEARS. Because of my sensitivities and my mother\u0027s poor choice in training methods, I began holding my bowel movements. (I was able urinate in the potty at a normal age, not sure when.) I would hold bowel movements whenever I had the urge to go, even if she put me back in a diaper. I held for weeks at times, and sometimes this required a lot of pain for me (obviously). When it finally got to the point that I couldn\u0027t hold it anymore, the BM was so big that I needed physical help to go. Sometimes it would get so bad that the opposite result would happen- I\u0027d have a sudden diarheaa because the muscles were fatigued. This went on for years, and the doctors kept telling mom that I\u0027d eventually outgrow it. She tried suppositories, oil, fiber, and even started giving me adult doses of laxatives. Finally, when I was 5 (two years into this), Mom made a tape recording of me SCREAMING while trying to go to the bathroom. A doctor took pity on us and prescribed enemas. I used them on and off for two more years. I was finally fully potty trained- AT SEVEN. I am now 25, and occasionally I still notice some health problems that may be attributable to this.\n\nNow, obviously there is no way I can fully explain why all that happened, and I certainly can not blame all of that on the book. I was a very sensitive kid, and my mom picked a bad time to do it too (I had just had a baby brother). But I just want to describe the danger of using a insensitive method. And I\u0027m not just talking about the pain I went through there- if we\u0027re to believe Freudian theories about the anal stage of childhood- well, let\u0027s just say I could be his poster child.\nI am now potty-teaching my own highly sensitive daughter, who will be 3 in a week. We have been working on this (no specific methods, just lots of sitting on the potty) for over a year now, and with NO results. But I\u0027m not in a hurry, and thats because she\u0027s not ready, and we need to do this on her timetable, not mine\n",
    "\nAs I was reading this book, I came across many poems that were far too sexually explicit for my taste, to name a few:  \"The First,\" \"Early Images of Heaven\" and \"Full Summer.\"  I found these poems to be highly offensive, and improper for the general audience.\n\nHad I been warned of the book\u0027s sexually explicit content ahead of time, I would not have read it.

    "\nYou can tell I don\u0027t pay attention to Wall Street Journal or New York Times. I picked up David Sacks\u0027 book from Borders\u0027 Linguistics stack because of the title. I should have known better. \n\nI started the first chapter and didn\u0027t have the time or intention to finish it. The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks, in my opinion, systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works (scholarly it is not). \n\nEven within the first 20 pages or so, I was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims, utter misinformation, and distastefully Euro/English-centric. Here are some examples:\n\n\"The alphabet was not the earliest writing: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and probably China already had nonalphabetic systems. But the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found, before or since (p.1)\" -- What about Hirogana for Japanese? Syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables. \n\n\"The \u0027spreadability\u0027 of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very bright indeed. (p. 10)\" -- He was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets, such as Swahili, Serbo-Croatian, Urdu/Hindi, and Yiddish. And then came this proud comment on the prospect \"our Roman letters\". Immediately following the above quote, he gave examples of Azerbaijian and Tatarstan\u0027s decision to switch to Roman, as well as other \"struggling nation\"\u0027s likewise decisions to \"switch to Roman letters for native tongues, as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn English. Tragically, much that is venerable and spiritually sustaining while be lost. Yet that seems inevitable in the 21st century were are shaping. And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield such power.\"\n\nHis view of the learnability of the alphabet is also uneducated, shall I say. The following superficial comment could have come from an old gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime. \n\n\"An alphabet enjoys on huge advantage over any other writing system: It needs fewer symbols. No other sysmtem can get away with so few. This makes an alphabet easier to learn. Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy, which typically takes about another five years of instruction\". \n\nAnd -- he writes -- because of this simplicity, children can become literate before the working age. \"This cricial fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy. (p.5)\" Well, \"vehicle\" is a very clevery way of framing it. At least he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is mass literacy. Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution. Now Sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who\u0027s by implying that the Europeans and Western ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God. (Guns, what guns?)\n\nSacks also compared \"our 26 letters\" -- as if alphabetic writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese. \"Today Chinese schoolchildren normally take three years longer than Western children to learn to read and write, with most of that \nextra time devoted to mastering the symbols.\" \n\nThis is completely misinformation. Learning to read Chinese is not easy, but do a little research, you will find studies over studies and books over books on comparitive studies of literacy (including my own). I\u0027ve nevery seen a credible study that substantiates the 3-year lag. By the way, Sacks almost never gives citations. \n\nI think that\u0027s enough. This explains my total disappointment with the book -- I sholdn\u0027t have any high expectation from the start, had I known who David Sacks is.\n",

    "\nI wanted to be interested in this book, but it became pretty boring ater a while. There is an undercurrent of romanticism that pervades the authors purpose. He claims to be neutral, yet his descriptions and conversations with many of the people slant towards idol worship. Although the author claims to be in recovery, I did not get the sense of how drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives. I felt that his narrative was self serving, and glorifying the wonders of drugs and experimentation. There is a price to pay. What was good was hearing his father\u0027s take on the whole down side of watching his son grow up loaded. That was interesting. I\u0027m getting weary of the proselytizing about how epochal the 1960\u0027s, 70\u0027s and 80\u0027s were. I didn\u0027t like his picture either\n",
    "\nMy brother had severe acne a year or so ago that he inherited from my Dad\u0027s side of the family.  He had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on Accutane.  Having heard bad things about the side effects, my Dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication.  He faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever.  Some of the ideas in the book are absurd - as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne, I can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous.  When I was a teenager, I\u0027d go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible, and I got through high school with only the occasional zit.  I\u0027ve read that for a small number of people, diet can be a factor for acne, but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause (this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition isn\u0027t sexy).  Since medication should always be a last resort, a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes, but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere.  For the curious, while my brother had some strong side effects from the Accutane (none dangerous, primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes), it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin\n",

So what went wrong?  A young girl appears to speak with Falco believing someone in her family wants to kill her.  And away we go, on and on and on!

Heaven forbid she be a nurse, housewife, teacher.\n3) Your daughter won\u0027t be \"successful\" if she goes to a coed school. Send her to a female only institution, that way she only has to compete against other girls.\n4) Your daughter won\u0027t be a success without playing poker, chess or other strategy games.

    "\nFirst a little background... I\u0027m 53 with a preteen son. I\u0027m not quite a Luddite.  I make my living from an online business that I own and operate. Our \"big\" present to our son last Xmas was a computer -- one he and I were going to build from scratch. The main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work. We gave our son a budget (not big by gamer PC standards) to shop for the parts. \n\nI\u0027ve read a few books recently on the gaming \"culture\" to better understand it. This book came highly recommended from reviews here, so I read it.\n\nMy reaction to the book? It took a while, but I finally realized it felt like I was reading a study paid for and prepared on behalf of the video game industry. There are lots of great statistics, but rather flimsy rational defending extensive video game playing and how it\u0027s successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future.  \n\nI did learn a few things. I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays video games extensively. I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer. I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer.\n\nA main thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out, because video games are about figuring out how to beat the game. Interesting, since by the examples cited, it mostly appears to be trial and error with no significant logic involved. I call it learn by trying anything, as opposed to learn by thinking. Both have their place.\n\nSupposedly, gamers are more willing to take (theoretically controlled) risks as well. Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom (and bust) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers (who largely ran the dot.coms). I see a different story than the authors from those days of yore.\n\nI could go on, but I think you get the point. The book says little (nothing?) about how video games are helping gamers learn math, science, or reading. Personally, I believe those skills/knowledge are MUCH more important to a person\u0027s future than the ability to learn thru trial and error. \n\nMaybe the conclusions of the authors will prove to be correct. I hope so. But personally, I\u0027m concerned for any business that runs on the pure gamer mentality that I understand to be endorsed by the book.\n",
    "\nUnfortunately, Sidney Wolfe and the whole \"Worst Pills\" business enterprise is riding on the reputation of Public Citizen as a champion for consumers, but has failed to live up to it with this guide. In some cases, warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports, but rather, are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves -- hardly an unbiased, consumer-oriented source of information. Consider as one example the book\u0027s \"Do Not Use\" warning regarding the prescription drug, Armour Thyroid. Rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation (because there ISN\u0027T any research), the \"guide\" instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association, two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less expensive drug -- out of business. If this is the sort of \"unbiased information\" you want about the drugs you take, you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets. If millions of thyroid patients taking Armour Thyroid were to follow the advice in \"Worst Pills,\" the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health.

Montana is far west not \u0027mid\u0027 west.  Secondly, Nazi helicopters?  This is just plain sloppy.  MacLean should have known much better.\n\nThis one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy.

    "\nHank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned.  He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups, to include pretribulationists.  Indeed, his \"scholarship\" is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda....  To see real scholarship, get Tim Cohen\u0027s materials (see below):\n\nTim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy \"experts\" or \"scholars\" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, \"The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea,\" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: \"The REAL Rapture\".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen\u0027s \"The REAL Rapture\" (based on a volume in his forthcoming \"Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period\" series (see Prophecy House\u0027s site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon)\n",

The desirable format would be \"This feature, which MS call \u0027X\u0027, is \u0027Y\u0027 plain english\", but instead the Y feature will only ever be called X. \nThis is not a helpful book\n",
    "\nIf I had been an editor and received \"Deadly Slipper\",\nI would have said the following:\n\n\"Dear Ms. Wan,\n\nYour book is unacceptable for the following reasons:\n\n1) The Setting.  One hazard of writing about the place\nwhere you spend your summers is that you end up\nwriting through the eyes of a visitor rather than a\nnative.  Dordogne sounds delightful,and I\u0027d certainly\nlike to visit it based on your descriptions of\ndelightful pigeon coops and sheep scattered across the\nlandscape, but it is disturbing that you have\ncicadas singing in May.  It suggests you are only\nfamiliar with the setting during the vacation months\nwhen you habitually visit. To really describe a place,\nI think you need to know it better.\n\n2) The characters.  Because you spend your summers in\nDordogne, you appear to know only other wealthy\nforeigners.  All your main characters are expatriates\nwith irritatingly bourgeois occupations.  I don\u0027t know\nif you realize that all the native-born French\ncharacters you portray are ugly, boorish, sexually\ndepraved, mentally defective, criminal, or terminally\nquaint, and they all appear to make cheese.  Surely\nthis isn\u0027t a realistic portrayal of the French.\n\n3) The Orchids.  Actually, the orchids are fine, but\nthe idea that orchid fanciers are maniacal and\npossibly homicidal is a questionable one; most orchid\nfanciers are fairly tedious.  Also, the idea that a lady\nslipper mutant would spontaneously occur and allow the\norchid to live outside its native habitat is idiotic. \nAnyone would tell you that a hybrid is a better bet.\n\n4) The Dogs.  One cute dog is sufficient; two are too\nmuch.  Puppies are inexcusable.\n\n5) The Romance.  Most mystery writer are aware of the\nhazard of including a romance in a mystery, but you\nwalked in innocently, unaware that your two characters\nare unpleasant, self-involved and have no chemistry\n(and that\u0027s not even mentioning their unspeakable\ndogs).  You set a big obstacle in their path by having\none think the other is a deranged serial killer; a\ngreat writer might be able to pull this off, but you\ncan\u0027t. \n\n6) Trendoid aspects.  Epistolary novels are *so* 18th\ncentury.  But having a NY psychiatrist profile the\nserial killer by email is so LAST WEEK.  You will be\nsorry you did this, sooner rather than later.  \n\n7) The Ending.  Ridiculous and melodramatic.  Georges Simenon wrote about crime with great psychological acuity.  You should read one of his books.\n\n",
    "\nThis book is very disappointing. The writing is terrible and rather amateurish. The writer bored me, maybe something\u0027s lost in translation from French, I don\u0027t know.  I already knew the killer the first time he was introduced in the book, although the writer tried to create red herrings which did not work. Mara sounds stupid, immature and inconsistent. Skip this book, it\u0027s not worth your time. Peter Mayle\u0027s mysteries set in France are way much better that this. At least his novels have sense of humor, suspense, very interesting characters and most important, they are very well written\n",
    "\nI was extremely disappointed by this book/pamphlet, being misled by the other favorable reviews.  It is completely lacking in information.  It has 51 6\"x8\" pages with huge font and too many cartoons.  It successfully defines what is good and bad posture, but does not provide excercises to improve it (it simply states to \"practice\" good posture).  There are much much better alternatives.  I have read \"Posture Alignment\" and recommend that, and have heard of great reviews for \"Posture, Get It Straight!\"\n",
    "\nThis book is the typical package of business ideas.  The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful.  In addition, there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work.  The author does state that what may be work for one person, may be play to another.  However, this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you don\u0027t mind putting in the time or work.  The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort, which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry, Restauranteur for example).\n\nThis book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type.  Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one\n",
    "\nAnd you shouldn\u0027t inhale.\nSeveral reviewers have ecstatically proclaimed this book and movie to be an eye-opening, truth-revealing work, but those who are credulous enough to think they learn history through agenda-focused books and films like \"Hunting\" need to go back and see other \"documentaries\" like \"Triumph Of The Will\", \"The Eternal Jew\" or \"Reefer Madness\".\nLet\u0027s be honest, people. \nThis book was written by a strongly pro-Clinton columnist and the movie was produced by well-known FOB (Friend Of Bill) Harry Thompson.  It\u0027s about as objective as the factually challenged \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", a work that Moore himself now calls \"satire\".  (By the way, I\u0027ll bet you didn\u0027t know that many Middle Easterners who have seen Moore\u0027s movie are outraged at the shallow, stereotypical and racist image he presented of their people and culture.)  \nThe point is, whether intentional or just laziness these dime-a-dozen political books typically contain significant misrepresentations.  If you\u0027re already a member of the author\u0027s congregation, you won\u0027t care.  You\u0027ll shout \"hallelujah!\" and say that \"Hunting\" has given the world Great Truths.  But clear thinkers understand that it\u0027s foolish to uncritically accept the representations in either this book or the followup movie.\n"

If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal.  Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases.  I have to wonder what they could be: \"Damned Melon!\" or \"I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!\"???  I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether.

    "\nThe acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive\u0027s character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can\u0027t possibly know what is going on. I\u0027m still not sure what Jody Foster\u0027s character brings to the plot.  \n\nAny way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don\u0027t know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a \"s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn\u0027t Clive\u0027s character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine. \n\nFinding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn\u0027t guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent. \n",

    "\nIt\u0027s amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology, from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification. This is a very dull, shapeless, stilted movie. I wouldn\u0027t bother to denounce it on artistic grounds, but since it is above all a piece of propaganda, I\u0027m compelled to condemn it as history. What it presents is the \"War between the States\" version of the Civil War, in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes,their beloved hills and dales, their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North. There are only two Black characters, both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters; otherwise, slavery is beside the point. The generalship of Lee and Jackson, of course, is idolized, while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools. The battle scenes are perfectly predictable; guys charge on foot, other guys shoot, the fields are littered with bodies. Wouldn\u0027t a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting? How real is it to show only one train, and that Southern, in a war won more by transportation than by musketry? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession, if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War wasn\u0027t really about slavery, then I challenge you honor! I defy you to read just one heavy, scholarly book, Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia. It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives, over slavery, in the 1830s, twenty-five years before the election of Lincoln. The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought, and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides, Blue and Grey\n",

    "\nEditorial Reviews\n\nAmazon.com essential video\nAfter initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love. Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty, who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status. Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter, Joan Fontaine in Rebecca, Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, and Martha Scott in Our Town? Well, evidently Rogers had real-life moxie too. --David Horiuchi \n\nProduct Description\nKnown for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940\u0027s Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty, an indomitable working-class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society, makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) or marriage to a struggling physician (James Craig). Rogers\u0027 deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails. Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda, capturing the girl\u0027s affecting isolation, awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph. Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead (all four Oscar nominees* for their fine work), Johnny Belinda (nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture) blends atmosphere, nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi\n",
    "\nI\u0027m surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn\u0027t much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual \"pap\" you\u0027d expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn\u0027t do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character. \n\nAlthough the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.\n\nThis movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like \u0027\u0027The Three Amigo\u0027s\u0027\u0027; on paper you would think it couldn\u0027t miss, but on film it\u0027s painful to watch\n",
    "\nthis has got to be the WORST film I\u0027ve ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don\u0027t have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he\u0027s sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I\u0027ve seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96\u0027. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television.\nNOTE\u0027S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT\nA song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She\u0027s to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.   \n \n",

What a shame. \n\nIf you have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You\u0027re very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him.\n\nIf you are a fan of the book, steer well clear. You\u0027re likely to want to poke Miyazaki with a stick and see if his head turns into a turnip or his turnip into a head.\n",

    "\nWell, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush\u0027s campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton\u0027s campaign, and basically the star of the movie.

I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa!\nIt was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That\u0027s IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That\u0027s it.  \nIf you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.  \nIf you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie...\nThere was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....  \nOh, and the story line?  What was it again????  \nYeah...\nI love movies, good ones and bad ones.\nBut this one???

    "\nFrom start to finish a total waste of time.  I viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman, we were all appalled at how desparate this \"Pamela\" was note to the director not all women waiting on God are that desparate.  The so called Christian principals in this movie were laughable.  At the end of the movie I found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time\n",
    "\n     This movie was so horrible I don\u0027t know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn\u0027t this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you\u0027re trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn\u0027t permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it\u0027s okay to go against the word of God if you\u0027re in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston\u0027s character says seductively, \"I\u0027m looking for a man with his mind on Jesus\" Yet she\u0027s dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she\u0027s dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone\u0027s grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman\u0027s dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry \"Flash\" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity\n",

    "\nCheap Trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today.\nThey have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age!  What other band sounds better 30 years later?\n\nAfter my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn\u0027t understand why they translated to tape poorly.  Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out.  And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there\u0027s a great build up to the climax of each song.\n\nHowever, what\u0027s really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song.  NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY.  It\u0027s like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show.  The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc.  \n\nThe closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs.  That\u0027s exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show.\n\nBonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety.\n\nPerhaps someday we\u0027ll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD.\n\nUpdate 6/14/05:  Exactly a year later, I\u0027ve still yet to pop this into my DVD player for a second watch, and Cheap Trick\u0027s still my favorite band. \n",
    "\nThis DVD gives documentary coverage concerning such DA VINCI CODE topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Scion, the Knights Templar, the Gnostic Gospels, Le Dossier Secrets, Da Vinci paintings, and Opus Dei.\n\nThis DVD, BEYOND THE DA VINCI CODE seems to bend over backwards, measuring every narrated word, to try to support and be sympathetic towards the Dan Brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary, they still seem to be in favor of what Dan Brown has written in the DA VINCI CODE.\n\nOut of a half dozen expert interviewees, the most notable are two \"big\" names who are MAJOR influences on THE DA VINCI CODE book. Margaret Starbird, author of THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR; and Richard Leigh, one of three authors of HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, (which was a NY Times Bestseller in 1982), both appear throughout this program. \n\nThese two are probably the biggest proponents of the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy today, after Dan Brown himself. So it is especially meaningful when Richard Leigh and Margaret Starbird disagree with what Dan Brown has written!\n\nAccording to expert interviewee Richard Leigh, though THE DA VINCI CODE book says that the Knights Templar found documents to prove the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy, in reality, NOBODY knows what, if anything, was found by the Knights Templar in Solomon\u0027s Temple. \n\nLeigh also says the whole business about the pentagram, pentacles, 5-pointed stars as mainly representing the \"sacred feminine\" is NONSENSE--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often! \n\nRichard Leigh also explains that the original Priory of Scion was last referenced in 1619, but the modern day Priory of Scion people from the last 50 years are \"bonkers,\" trying to present a hoax of the LE DOSSIER SECRETS, to try to gain political influence for themselves. \n\nThis LE DOSSIER SECRETS, which appears on the bogus \"FACT\" page at the beginning of THE DA VINCI CODE book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of Jesus, but has been debunked for decades in France. It does NOT belong on a page titled \"FACT\" in the DA VINCI CODE book! That is very misleading, not factual. Brown says the LE DOSSIER SECRETS were discovered, but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney!\n\nMargaret Starbird, another major influence on the Dan Brown novel, says that even though she believes in the Jesus/Magdalene bloodline, there is NO PROOF of the bloodline lasting into the French Merovingian line of kings, circa the first millenium A.D.\n\nThe documentary, using other expert interviewees and location footage, goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the Rose Line alignments being found in significant locations throughout THE DA VINCI CODE novel; as well as showing there is no evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Scion, let alone the Grandmaster; the rose is NOT the symbol for the Priory of Scion; and Opus Dei has NO INTEREST in the \"secret\" bloodline of Jesus/Magdalene because they don\u0027t believe it even exists.\n\nSadly, most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show, in brief statements, before quickly moving on to the next topic; while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what Dan Brown\u0027s DA VINCI CODE book claims about the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy.\n\nOverall I was disappointed by this HISTORY CHANNEL DVD for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain\u0027t so in the DA VINCI CODE book--though I am not surprised, the HISTORY CHANNEL usually sides against Christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows, in my opinion.\n\nA much better DA VINCI CODE debunking DVD is BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel\u0027s lies about history and Jesus\n",
    "\nI saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950\u0027s, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn\u0027t really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn\u0027t quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity.\n",

Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie\u0027s release on DVD.

    "\nEven though I would agree that \"Erin Brockovich\" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in \"Pretty Woman.\"  I am second to no one in enjoying a good \"David and Goliath\" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the \"true\" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich\u0027s story, in the same way that the \"Xena\" character is the main attraction in \"Xena: Warrior Princess\" (though it should be noted that Xena\u0027s wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).\n\nErin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in \"Pretty Woman\" (prior to Richard Gere\u0027s character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie\u0027s beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney\u0027s (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller\u0027s medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG\u0026E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG\u0026E (by and through the representation of Erin\u0027s boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.\n\nRoberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired \"work clothes\" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin\u0027s apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.\n\nAlbert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin\u0027s boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin\u0027s boyfriend-by-convenience.  The \"convenience\" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin\u0027s benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar \"bonus\" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a \"thanks\" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers. \n\nThe plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.\n",
    "\nThis is the worst Workout tape that I have ever purchase, the trainer switches moves to quick and doesnt explain what she is doing like she expects you to know before hand what she is about to do.

    "\nWhile some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie.  This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven\u0027t seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.\n\nSo let\u0027s get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students?  Lucas Black\u0027s character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do?  Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that\u0027s about double the size of his apartment?\n\nI would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn\u0027t be embarassed, they would laugh at the film\u0027s poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it\u0027s a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.\n\nGiven my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.\n\n\n\n",
    "\nI\u0027m making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie.  I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance...  all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back.\n\nThe performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends.  To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles.  It has the misfortune to depend on the \"acting\" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher.  It fails on all counts.  \n\nI do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the \"teen\" movie sub-genre, under which some would place \"Down to You.\"  (In fact, \"Can\u0027t Hardly Wait\" is one of my favorite movies.)  I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination.  If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD.  If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie\n",

    "\nConsidering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher\u0027s knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I\u0027d made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci\u0027s The Mercenary or Parolini\u0027s Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film\n",
    "\nRather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. \n\nMartha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck\u0027 besides the character\u0027s surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides\u0027 (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder\u0027s character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.\n\nThe image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder\u0027s protagonist\u0027s journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.\n\nFor this reason, `Heathers\u0027 fails as an exploration of the `Hell\u0027 of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly\u0027s Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty\u0027 as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat\u0027 people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a \u0027war on fat\u0027 (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.\n",
    "\nThose of you who remember Ryan Starr from American Idol know why she quickly became \"has been\" material for VH1\u0027s the Surreal Life. Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials.  The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time.  Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression \u0026 emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails.  That is all I can say, I would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again\n",
    "\n\nWhatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and \"sparks fly.\"  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.\n\nFrom the movie\u0027s self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production\u0027s other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues? \n\nIn point of fact, however, the single attempt at \"comedy\" comes from DeLuise\u0027s portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.  \n\nThe bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the \"actresses\" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise\u0027s fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.\n\nAbout the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.  Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film.\n\n",

    "\n\"Con Express\" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn\u0027t enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn\u0027t really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I\u0027d be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn\u0027t expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won\u0027t mind this one too much. Just go easy on it\n",
    "\nI was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it\u0027s a propaganda film but that doesn\u0027t mean much to most people.

Watching the first fifteen minutes of \"heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads,\" is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It\u0027s suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen.

Dennis Christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator; and June Lockhart and Lyle Waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as Tierney\u0027s estranged parents.  The movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it\u0027s so shoddily included, it makes no statement at all.\nLittle heard of movie; I can see why\n",
    "\nCesar Milan, the so-called \u0027dog whisperer\u0027, bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful \u0027corrections\u0027 to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn\u0027t the slightest shred of evidence going for it. \n\nYes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn\u0027t the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do \u0027bad\u0027 doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn\u0027t care whether or not you\u0027re alpha; he only cares that what he\u0027s doing works to get him what he wants. \n\nTechnically, Cesar\u0027s methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they\u0027re all very obedient and mannerly. They don\u0027t haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don\u0027t need to be \u0027Alpha\u0027 to get them that way; neither does anyone else. \n\nI strongly suggest that you don\u0027t buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor\u0027s \u0027Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs\u0027, Melissa Alexander\u0027s \u0027Click for Joy!\u0027 (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson\u0027s \u0027The Culture Clash\u0027. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain\n",
    "\nI agree, these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason, they are not that good.  OK, there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying.

    "\nThe sound on this DVD is absolutely horrible.  The dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects, making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering.  I also have the VHS, on which the sound is perfect, so I can still watch this wonderful movie.  But I would sure like to get my money back for the DVD\n",
    "\nThis review is more about the \"SuperBit\" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself.  The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it.\n\nHowever, the transfer on to this 2002 \"SuperBit\" version is very lacking in several areas.  The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer.  The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and \"Making-Of\" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality.\n\nThey have failed to do that here.  The video and audio quality are not what they could be.\n\nFirst, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc.  This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data.  However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be.\n\n\"Panic Room\" is a 112 minute movie.  Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps.  However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps.\n\nThis SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn\u0027t as high quality as it could be.  The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected.  So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate.  DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps.  This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn\u0027t even used.  The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this.  This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear.  The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used.\n \nIf they had encoded \"Panic Room\" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated.  \n\nSuch an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space.  A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal.  The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc.\n\nI notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006.  Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise.  It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now.\n\nAnother thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions.  The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff.  If the movie contains both DD and DTS encodings on the first disc, with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 Mbps or greater, it is already in the SuperBit mold.\n",
    "\nI got nothing to say. Was this supposed to be intense? Was this supposed to be a thriller? It was boring. Horrible acting, except for Forest Whitaker: but even he couldn\u0027t save this one.

    "\nMany people had reccomended this movie to me but it failed to live up to its reputation.  The quality of the film-making was aweful, the acting bad to the point of utter ridiculousness, and the script read like a cross between a psychotherapists analysis and one of those pulp romance novels about angsty teenagers.  It gets some credit toward the end for showing some self-awareness of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was.  There were some cute moments, and it was interesting to see the humble roots of one of the big L word ladies, but don\u0027t go into this movie expecting a highly polished end product\n",

    "\n\"The Hospital\" as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience.  It is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one.  I was a fan of Paddy Chayefsky\u0027s \"Network\" and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness.  I\u0027m led to believe that Chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole.  If George C.Scott\u0027s character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he\u0027s not brooding, drinking, or contemplating suicide he\u0027s off on some rant?  Diana Rigg is completely wasted in this film.  Her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by Scott\u0027s character.  The film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of Arthur Hiller.  The medical profession can be lampooned but don\u0027t look for it in this uneven tirade of a film\n",

    "\nBetty Hutton has a colossal amount of energy. She seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining. She\u0027s a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers. Her voice is sturdy, durable, indestructible.\n\nBut oh my God, her acting choices ... She and the Indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film (whereas Buffalo Bill, allegedly a larger-than-life character, looks like a corpse by comparison, and Howard Keel, in only his second film, must manage to act like these are human beings he\u0027s relating to). \n\nTake a look at Betty Hutton\u0027s reaction upon seeing Howard Keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered \"a bit much\" if seen from the back row of an amphitheater. At best, her performance is clownlike; at worst, it\u0027s apelike. Little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity. It\u0027s a magnificent effort, and a stunning testimony to her desire to please, but her comedy has no reality, no nuance, no connection to any sincere emotion. She seizes on \"hick\" and drives that into the ground, then she plays nothing but \"infatuated\" for a while before toggling to \"resentful\" and so forth ... It\u0027s a series of masks and set pieces, but it\u0027s not a character. Judy Garland was in sad shape at that point in her life, but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind Annie\u0027s rootin\u0027-tootinest moments, and she wouldn\u0027t have neglected Annie\u0027s grit even in the melting sentimental scenes. Nobody can do vulnerability like Judy, and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character. Annie could be a wonderful character, a great self-conflicted mess of strength, longing, guts, femininity, skill, naivete and worldiness, all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead Betty Hutton makes her a pop-eyed, crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet. I am surprised that Hutton didn\u0027t insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out. Maybe they just wouldn\u0027t let her. The scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh, oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide. \n\nI kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on, and the memory of Betty Hutton\u0027s performance is branded on my brain, but it\u0027s because this performance seems like it\u0027s following the traditions of some other culture, some other world. It\u0027s like going to a sideshow.\n\nThat said, the tunes are a non-stop parade of hits -- there probably isn\u0027t any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another, in wildly different styles, with effective melodies worth remembering. The classic tunes just keep coming. The movie works as spectacle and songfest, and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness. But if you\u0027re looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations, you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes.\n\n",
    "\nI have to disagree with the reviews above and say that I watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago. Unfortunately I couldn\u0027t find anything about this film I remember enjoying. It\u0027s a cross between The Blob, The Thing and a really crap detective movie. Moriarty\u0027s character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80\u0027s kiddy movie. This film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you\u0027ll lose interest halfway through I guarantee it. No suspense, few laughs, and way to hokey to watch twice. If you love this movie you need to get out more.\n",
    "\nMichael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It\u0027s Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn\u0027t because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when \"the stuff\" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it\u0027s worth, don\u0027t be too critical on it.\nWhat I learned from The Stuff: Dairy products are evil! Especially if they come from with in the earth!\nIf you like The Stuff, I recommend: Watching other B-movies, such as Island of the Alive 3, Zombi 3 and 4, etc\n",
    "\nI love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn\u0027t carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It\u0027s obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn\u0027t much better\n",
    "\nI am a big fan of Frank Miller\u0027s work and I loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from. When I saw this film I was blown away by the visuals. It had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything I had seen in a movie before.\n\nHaving mentioned it\u0027s good points I have to say I was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen. It seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen. For the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through. I had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet.\n\nEach extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like I was being mugged. What works in a graphic novel doesn\u0027t necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you\u0027ll see here. All the characters were severely and tragically 2-dimensional with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience. Also, many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here.\n\nPurists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film. However, my bottom line opinion is it\u0027s a good film to watch for the visual look only, but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the \u0027mute\u0027 button on. This film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark\n",
    "\nIncredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn\u0027t know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of \"Mississippi Burning\" or the anger and impunity of \"Ghosts of Mississippi\", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre\u0027s list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I\u0027m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn\u0027t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she\u0027s only worthy of b-grade \"Miss Congeniality\" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can\u0027t be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not \"a powerful film.\" It\u0027s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn\u0027t hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven\u0027t seen quality comparisons and classics like \"Mississippis Burning,\" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don\u0027t know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies\n",

    "\n....for several reasons.  Apparently, the other online reviewers are extremely over-analytical in their critiques of this film.  The DVD\u0027s jacket has a quote from Rolling Stone...\"Think \u0027Sex and the City\u0027 with men!\"  Well, I say, \"Think again.\"   As an avid watcher of \"Sex and the City\", this film has little if any comparison to SATC.  Firstly, this film is not a comedy.  There were very small instances when I kind of chuckled, but could barely muster a real laugh.  Actually, towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that I kept hitting FAST FORWARD on the remote (those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what I mean here!).  The characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person\u0027s life.  These disjointed glimpses don\u0027t give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters.  Yes, they are all bored whether they are in their 30\u0027s or their 50\u0027s.  Yes, they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs.  I usually enjoy movies with this breaking-away-from-boredom type of plot for example...Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), Facing Windows (also starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and a MUCH better film), Under the Tuscan Sun, Shirley Valentine, A Month by the Lake, etc. The Last Kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do, however.  The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life\u0027s decisions, only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film\n",
    "\nI was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.  \n\nThe acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn\u0027t very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren\u0027t exciting.  When the action isn\u0027t exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.\n\nI don\u0027t hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn\u0027t do too well this time.\n\nThis really isn\u0027t worth your time.

A show like the Simpsons not only has more episodes per season and sells for the same price but the people involved in the Simpsons go the extra mile to satisfy fans:  full episode commentaries with writers, producers, directors, voice actors, etc as well as deleted scenes and other special features.  Matt and Trey provide generally uninteresting \"mini commentaries.\"  No doubt about it, the boys are just generally \"phoning it in\" at this point, seemingly caring only about continuing their franchise and maximizing their profits for as little effort as possible\n",

The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category.

The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither).\n\nThe acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic.\n\nBut the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its \"thriller\" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst.\n\nThis movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.)\n\nIf a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There\u0027s some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension.\n\nI\u0027m just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way.\n\nI haven\u0027t read the book, but I bet it\u0027s a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud.\n\n\n",
    "\n   Not only was the dialogue of the film trite and the plot much like a pornographic after school special, but the movie unfortunately reinforces a worldview which anti-homosexual groups been touting for years--If you\u0027re thinking turning your female frienship into a relationship, don\u0027t.  The lesbian always goes crazy and dies in the end.  \n  If you\u0027re interested in finding out what I\u0027m talking about, Lisa Duggan explains how this ideology gets transimitted and reinforced in her book Sapphic Slashers. Also, If you\u0027re interested in watching a film about first-time lesbian love, please do yourself a favor and check out The Incredible True Story of Two Girls in Love or But, I\u0027m a Cheerleader.

    "\nThe shows themselves are wonderful, but the people who put together this DVD set should be ashamed of this paltry effort! There are NO cast or staff interviews about the ending of such a wonderful series. NO commentaries. No English sub-titles.  NO John Spencer honorarium of any kind. They didn\u0027t even take the time to include the 1 hour re-showing of the original pilot they aired before the finale!  The only \"extras\" are two not-special-at-all special features dealing with the debate. This DVD set is definately NOT worth the money to buy it brand new.\n",

At first I respected the director for showing it and not shying away. A FULL MINUTE LATER, I started feeling awkward and uncomfortable. It wasn\u0027t even artistic, it was just disgusting and truly disturbing\n",
    "\nMargarett Mitchell must be rolling in her grave. She wrote a masterpiece in the 1930\u0027s, then Alexandra Ripley bought the rights to her book by conning Margaret Mitchell\u0027s heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative.  Alexandra Ripley\u0027s novel was an embarrasing pile of mush, even worse than a Barbara Courtland romance novel.\n\nBeautiful costumes and a good cast - but the script is a soap opera and very poorly written with too many cliche\u0027s.  The TV movie version is even worse than Alexandra Ripley\u0027s book. I would have given this movie zero stars - but gave it 2 stars solely for the world class acting of Sean Bean as the deliciously evil Lord Fenton. \n\nSean Bean heats up the screen as a sexy, feral villian along the lines of \"The Man You Love to Hate\" as an unsafe sex symbol.  Unless you are a Sean Bean fan, there is nothing worthwhile about this film.  The script is trite, cliche\u0027d and very slow moving.  Sean Bean is only in Disc 1 and his character is eliminated and the movie slides downhill from there.\n\nDisc 2 is overwrought with very boring, drawn out courtroom scenes...I was almost rooting that Scarlett would be hanged for the murder just to see an end to this movie!\n\nI\u0027ve always liked Joanna Whaley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton. They are excellent actors wasted in this pile of mush movie. Ann-Margaret\u0027s performance as Belle Watling is so bad I wanted to slap her.\n\nDo yourself a favor and watch the original Gone With the Wind starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh if you want to see a wonderful film\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve loved this movie ever since I saw it on CBS years ago so I was really excited to own it on DVD. Unfortunately the experience was ruined when I discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc. Loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene. I was very dissapointed. \n\nThe movie is great but the sound problems aren\u0027t worth the purchase. Stay away\n",
    "\nThe only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.  I found myself saying \"Oh come on\" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities).  The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details)\n",
    "\nThe plot to this movie or so called sequal is horrible.  I rented this movie expecting something good and I end up falling asleep.  I actually had to watch it several times just to find out what really happened.  Don\u0027t even buy it, it is a waist of your money\n",
    "\nWhatever ills are in the world, it\u0027s all the fault of the corporations. That\u0027s the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie. For example, instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work, they forget that these people\u0027s alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that\u0027s why they took that job in the first place!  These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and, if they chose that job freely, it must be their BEST option, no matter how crazy it seems to us. As people\u0027s skills rise, as opportunities increase over time (by having MORE corporations and not less, to create more competition for these people\u0027s labor), and as the country becomes wealthier, these people\u0027s wages will rise automaticaly and in fact, the wages of the whole country on the average.  There are no shortcuts to his.  A famous story comes from Nepal where anti-child labor laws, at the urging of the UN, turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs, as sad as it may be, were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families.  It\u0027s a slow process, but all the industrialized nations went through that process.  Government-mandated \"shortcuts\" usually produce results which are even worse.  However, the results speak for themselves: in VERY short period of time, for example, HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China, India and around the world thanks for the \"evil\" capalism \u0026 its corporations.  No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone.  Also, cost of living is very low there, so these pennies really can go a long way, don\u0027t measure it to the cost of living in the West.  What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people? I guess to let people starve to death, then the makers of this movie don\u0027t have have anyting to complain about!?  Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who\u0027s a psychopath.  A corpoartion is a legal entity yes, and may act like a separate \"being\" as far the law in concerned, but does a corporation have a nose, feet, stomach? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis? Of course, not, than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it??  Several of the main \"spokepersons\" in the movie, Chomsky, Michael Moore, Rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality.  To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie, you\u0027d have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are.  Throughout the whole movie, you\u0027re basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented, despite the director\u0027s claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 \u0026 1/2, it\u0027s more like 80%-20%).  Just look at Chomsky\u0027s comments about how the consumers are so stupid, they don\u0027t realize that all the things they buy they don\u0027t really need. I mean we don\u0027t need fashionable clothes (hey, let\u0027s all dress as boring as Chomsky!), DVD players, or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun.  Who is the judge of what you REALLY need?  Chomsky, of course. He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don\u0027t. You\u0027re too stupid to know what you want, according to him. He says that you should do \"more important things\", like...perhaps studying lingistics (which he teaches but which very few care about).  The movie DOES make some correct and good observations, especially regarding polution, however, I\u0027d say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed. It\u0027s also FULL of economic fallacies. It\u0027s worth watching I guess, just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie.  Despite all the ranting in the movie, it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life.  For examples, how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds?  Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies, forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind, forbid subsidies to companies, cut the suffocating red tape and regulation (esp. in developing countries but in the West too), cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10% (and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing, give people all around the world a better life, increase competition, etc.)  If these and other governments (and not corporations\u0027) problems were eliminated, the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away.  An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile (spoken about with much admiration), people with NO understanding about economics, how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for.\n",

    "\nI was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles\u0027 three World Series victories.  I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film).  Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series.\nMuch to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs.  What\u0027s that all about?  Does MLB Productions think I\u0027m going to illegally copy and distribute stills?

    "\nthe movie directors in the ME, particularly Iranians, are responding to demands by the West for certain type of movies. They produce what is demanded from them; in turn, they receive awards. cultural industry empowers these demands; they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the Western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded. There is no single ME movie which depict the story of Western imperialism in the ME and then awarded for doing so. ME movies must show that ME women are in need of emancipation; ME cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized. civilization itself is presented in vertical sense; there is a civilization somewhere out there all MEasterners are expected to reach; yet, it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them. (no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country; who deprived them of education and knowledge. the West is represented by beautiful, blonde nurses, a nice American guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his \"everyday Western knowledge of medicine\" in the midst of total ignorance, and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs. such a nice way to civilize!)\nthe story of Afghanistan is real. however, the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it. rather, it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand; in producing a product that can sell well. \nthe situation is miserable; but what caused such misery in Afghanistan? your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is Islam; it is that Islamic culture; that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes. such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors. there is no single implying in the movie, a smallest reference, that Afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the British and then the Russian and now Americans who played their Great Game on the chessboard of Eurasia. There is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them. those imperialists came in the name of civilization; French did to Algeria, the British did to India; all in the name of bringing them civilization. It was White Man\u0027s Burden to do so. Yet Makhmalbaf needs more awards. he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of Western audiences, in order to continue to be in demand. you did a nice job, applauses; go on.\n(anyone who is interested in cultural imperialism should read Foucault\u0027s works and Edward Said\u0027s Orientalism.\n",
    "\nIn the film commentary, Director Robert Altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying, \u0027I don\u0027t know what it was about but I really liked it.\u0027 (That\u0027s a paraphrase). And I think that\u0027s the key to why this film is so bad: The director didn\u0027t know what it was about.  \n\nThe weird, atonal score by Gerald Busby was an annoyance throughout, often drowning out the dialog. It\u0027s the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear, or in a psychological thriller, just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho. Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination. Just the same creepy atonal \u0027psycho\u0027 music all the time. \n\nDuvall and Spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal. Lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time, and dream-like sequences, conveying... mystery? suspense? drama what? Ah..I got it, they convey CONFUSION! That\u0027s it!

There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble.

    "\nThis movie is an insult to merely bad comedies. Gee, another movie with a fast-talking, potty-mouthed, black guy (hello Eddie Murphy) who, because it\u0027s perfectly fine in ultra-lib, pc Hollyweird, calls Charlie Sheen (and everyone else who is not Black) a host of nasty, racially-oriented names. The movie is a mess. Let\u0027s see. The protagonist (Tucker) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer, is chased around  by cops and the bad guys. The McGuffin is a sack of diamonds. Sheen is supposed to be a co-star, but like most of his other movies, he sleepwalks through it. Clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for Tucker. The sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along. First \"screenwriter\":\" Hey Bob, what will we have Tucker do next? Hey I know, let\u0027s have a car chase and have him call some people some names\" Second \"screenwriter\" \"Hey, great idea Fred, I sure don\u0027t have any ideas\".  Apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of Murphy the Trickster flicks.

What the men want is a jewel they lost 10 years earlier in a botched robbery that is being held in a secret place by Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), a mentally unstable young girl rotting away in a hospital. Since Nathan seems to be the only medical professional she trusts, Patrick uses him as a pawn to recover the jewel. Nathan is soon at the mercy of the kidnappers, but as he gets deeper into Elisabeth\u0027s mind, he realizes the young girl could be helped after all.\n\nIt\u0027s perfect casting to place Michael Douglas in the lead role, as no one could play yuppie paranoia quite like he can. Douglas has perfected this type of performance into an art form with his work in \"Fatal Attraction\" and \"A Perfect Murder; Douglas is a little more subdued than normal in this film, as his aging seems to be wearing away his ability to play the hot, rich stud who gets in over his head. The film does contain many moments of pure distressed Douglas (his forte), with his hair glistening, teeth clenched and his eyes scanning the room, etc. Douglas, at least in the first act of the film, makes an attempt to carry the picture with his expected bag of tricks. Soon enough, director Gary Fleder places too much narrative nonsense on Douglas\u0027s shoulders, and the actor eventually just gives up and lets the genre\u0027s conventions take him to the safety of the end credits.  Director Gary Fleder is no stranger to the fall thriller game, having directed both \"Kiss The Girls\" and the rollicking \"Things To Do In Denver When You\u0027re Dead.\" Not really an imaginative director, Fleder nevertheless can be counted on to get the job done. With \"Don\u0027t Say A Word,\" Fleder isn\u0027t working with a particularly good script, so he falls back on what has worked for him before. This plan of attack from Fleder leaves the picture stale and overtly familiar. The film is not interested in adding new elements to the plot to keep things at least appearing fresh. The end result making \"Don\u0027t Say A Word\" more boring than exciting.\n\nThe thriller, which is set in New York City, uses the city and apartment locations well, creating a nice sense of claustrophobia. It is when the action suddenly leaves the confines of the city and moves to a cemetery in a nearby island that the picture loses quite a bit of tension and interest. Moving to an obviously-a-soundstage cemetery ruins the fun of seeing the character freak out in their narrow apartments and office spaces. The film must end with a clichd showdown, which is the reason for the move to a different location, but Fleder makes a big mistake taking the story away from the grip of the big bad city.  The one element that Fleder does get right is the casting of actress Brittany Murphy. A powderkeg of emotions, Murphy is the perfect choice to play the deranged Elisabeth. Murphy is a grand talent (where is her Emmy for her voice work as Luanne Platter on \"King Of The Hill\"?), and the only actress in Hollywood that truly achieves success as both a tormented patient and a cute, little princess (\"Just Married\", \"Uptown Girls\"). Unpredictable and bristling with untapped passions, Murphy makes a vivid impression in \"Don\u0027t Say A Word.\"  You\u0027ve seen this type of film before, and just because it\u0027s the time of year when apples taste the best doesn\u0027t make this barely alive thriller any more enjoyable. For fans of the genre, \"Don\u0027t Say A Word\" is another solid installment in the Michael Douglas versus New York crime saga. Just don\u0027t expect any surprises\n",
    "\nWhat is the deal. Cant Hollywood leave well enough alone. How many classic animated movies are they going to ruin with sequels? Let me think, their was Balto 2, Little Mermaid 2, Aladdin 2 and three, Secret of Nimh 2, Land before time 2,3,4,5,6,7 etc. enough already. Next thing you know they\u0027ll be making a Lion King 2, and a Buity and the Beast 2. O wait, they already did that didn\u0027t they. All the movies I have named were great originals but God awful sequels. ADGTH 2 is just as bad. If you loved the original, STAY AWAY FROM ITS SEQUAL.       \n",
    "\nThis movie is one of cinema history\u0027s seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. \"Saturday Night Fever\" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales\u0027 torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don\u0027t think this one could.\n\nI understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80\u0027s children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie\u0027s plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.\n\nPhysically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man\u0027s job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.\n\nBut that\u0027s not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it\u0027s pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What\u0027s worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character\u0027s plights.\n\nThe other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it\u0027s certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out \"the Limey\" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they\u0027ve been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We\u0027re supposed to be moved by Beales\u0027 character\u0027s natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.\n\nPerhaps I\u0027m a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it\u0027s a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right (\"Saturday Night Fever\" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie\u0027s director. It\u0027s a shame\n",
    "\nBelieve it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I\u0027ve seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts.\n\n(I watched _Jacob\u0027s Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne\u0027s version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven\u0027t seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.) \n\nFlashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you\u0027ve never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song \"Maniac\" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in.\n\nSo, how was it?\n\nNot too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob\u0027s Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book \"believe in your dreams\" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don\u0027t know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time.\n\nI can\u0027t even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat.\n\nAlso, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It\u0027s a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!  Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since\n",
    "\nThis is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity\u0027s two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He\u0027s awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then\n",

    "\nFirst of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.  \n\nSadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor\u0027s depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.  \n\nMaybe I\u0027m not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film. \n\nIn addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I\u0027m one myself, having made two movies)\n\nThe only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better\n",

    "\nIncredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn\u0027t know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of \"Mississippi Burning\" or the anger and impunity of \"Ghosts of Mississippi\", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre\u0027s list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I\u0027m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn\u0027t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she\u0027s only worthy of b-grade \"Miss Congeniality\" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can\u0027t be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not \"a powerful film.\" It\u0027s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn\u0027t hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven\u0027t seen quality comparisons and classics like \"Mississippis Burning,\" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don\u0027t know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies\n",
    "\nI went into this movie thinking it would be great to see a film set in the turbulent but interesting history of first settlements in the far north of Northern America. Having only really seen Pocahontas through the eyes of Disney, I felt this would be a good chance to see something more significant and engaging on one of histories more interesting events.\n\nLike other reviewers, I found the photography and the scenery to be simply stunning. Visually, the film wows the viewer. The scenes simply amaze with their beauty, the sets with their majesty and also rustic simplicity. Coupled with the musical score, this was some of the best camera work I have seen in a long time. This was, in my opinion, the sole redeeming feature of the film.\n\nWhile the filme attempted to contemplate serious and deep issues of love, allegiance and so on, it succeeded in only boring the tears out this viewer with the monotonous monologues of the characters done as long lengths of naration. In one part, the plot lost some continuity and needed reviewing to get to grips with what had happened.\n\nFor actors of the calibre of Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, this film did not show them at their best. Certainly not the worst I have seen by any stretch, but definitely not the best I have seen from either one of these actors.\n\nTread with caution on this one, and hire it before you buy it. I am glad I did not spend good money purchasing it. Quite frankly, it is a great cure for insomnia\n",
    "\nThe New World is the least of Terrence Malick\u0027s limited filmography to date, and could be best described as a monotone poem. It\u0027s not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you\u0027re watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn\u0027t magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I\u0027m sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he\u0027s given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture\u0027 expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he\u0027s not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he\u0027s outshone by Q\u0027orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third. \n\nMalick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we\u0027ve barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals\u0027 from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick\u0027s promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it\u0027s meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I\u0027d watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students. The only surprise was that Jeff Chandler and his bouncing Basques didn\u0027t crop up.\n",

    "\nBefore I review, I\u0027d like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I\u0027d have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They\u0027re both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don\u0027t know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.\n\nThere are many things I don\u0027t like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that\u0027s the biggest problem. There\u0027s not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn\u0027t have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren\u0027t very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won\u0027t understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we\u0027re looking at either nothing, or a woman\u0027s nipples. That\u0027s not cinematic artistry, that\u0027s being either lazy or perverted.\n\nThe animation itself isn\u0027t even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It\u0027s choppy, and there\u0027s not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women\u0027s nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980\u0027s.\n\nThe only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It\u0027s probably kind of like how I didn\u0027t see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I\u0027d been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn\u0027t bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.\n\nIn short, if you\u0027re you\u0027re at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You\u0027ll find a lot to love, but I can\u0027t say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex\n",

    "\nTherese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood\u0027s boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.\n\nThe act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon\u0027s neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia\u0027s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.\n\nWith their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word \"death\" and the like.\n\nTrip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she\u0027s not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip\u0027s request, knowing nothing but Trip\u0027s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.\n\nAfter Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke.\nThey then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.\n\nThe girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.\n\nUltimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as \"Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.\") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could\u0027ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should\u0027ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as \"Elizabethtown\" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future\n",
    "\n     Stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic.

    "\nFor that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it\u0027s the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don\u0027t really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can\u0027t fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it\u0027s alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who\u0027s rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That\u0027s Pathetic, and so is this movie\n",
    "\nI got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it\u0027s really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big \"thumbs down\". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They\u0027re awesome!\n",
    "\nWho\u0027s idea was it to put Jessica Alba as Sue Storm?  Chris Evans\u0027s portrayal of Johnny Storm was somewhat disappointing too, although not as bad as Jessica Alba\u0027s portrayal of Sue Storm.  Why do they cast Hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies?  They really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters.  This movie was somewhat good, but it didn\u0027t feel all that great.  So far, this movie is just another of Marvel\u0027s somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of Elektra, The Incredible Hulk, Xmen 3, Daredevil, and The Punisher.  I was so happy to see Marvel characters getting their own movies, but after seeing what Hollywood does to them, I would rather see Marvel\u0027s chracters go back into hiding.  Special effects were good in this movie, and so was the story.  Michael Chiklis as the Thing was great, and his The Thing character makeup was done very well, and he played the character well too, as did Ioan Gruffud with Mr. Fantastic.  Jessica Alba and Chris Evans definitely demoted this movie\n",
    "\nThe central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920\u0027s Robin Hood and his band of gangsters. Unfortunately, even the Rat Pack cannot save this movie. The script is slow, dated,and dull. Barbara Rush\u0027s scenes are especially confusing. Her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie. Nothing comes of her apparent interest in Sinatra or Martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut. The main actors seemed to be bored, and with the exceptions of Bing Crosby and Peter Falk, walked through their performances. (Maybe they were hung over most of the time?)  \nSave your money and borrow it from your local library.\n",
    "\nWell folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (\"Crash\" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would \"change the world\".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don\u0027t like the film:  I don\u0027t much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn\u0027t depressing at all cause I didn\u0027t care.  It\u0027s just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.\n\nAll right, here\u0027s a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don\u0027t like any of these people, so their pain doesn\u0027t mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would\u0027ve worked, but now there just isn\u0027t anything there.  As far as what\u0027s actually in the movie, we\u0027ve got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we\u0027ve got Jared\u0027s mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto\u0027s friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there\u0027s no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He\u0027s got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that\u0027s it.  The doubly sad fact is that he\u0027s the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it\u0027s a wonder that the smack doesn\u0027t cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I\u0027ve seen, so that\u0027s not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don\u0027t even like either of them I\u0027m not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn\u0027t have been funny if I cared about her, but we\u0027ve been over that...  \n\nAnd I want you people to know that I\u0027m not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie\u0027s dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch \"Trainspotting\", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and \"Bubba Ho-Tep\", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as \"Requiem For A Dream\", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that\u0027s all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.  \n\n\"Requiem For A Dream\" isn\u0027t helped any by Darren Aronofsky\u0027s repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn\u0027t got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There\u0027s nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they\u0027re hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain\u0027t drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn\u0027t make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over. \n\nTruth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn\u0027t going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren\u0027t going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that\u0027s a good ending.\n\nGrade: D+ \n\nPS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows\n",
    "\nI give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people.

    "\nYou want realism of the Old West? Try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they didn\u0027t have tissues. Try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair, and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste, so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black.\n\nTHAT would be realistic, but it\u0027s a LOT more repellant to television audiences than gratuitous profanity. So this \"realistic\" show has characters with clean, fluffy hair and pretty teeth spew garbage langauge constantly -- and sucker viewers and reviewers buy this as \"realistic\"!!! Every great writer of every age and era, be it Mark Twain, Owen Wister, William Shakespeare, or John Steinbeck, or any other storyteller whose works have survived for generations, told \"realistic\" stories of their era but who understood what realistic trivia to keep in, and what to leave out, in order to TELL THE STORY. That is WHY their work has remained timeless.\n\nDeadwood\u0027s writing shows a huge insecurity complex in choosing to rely on a gimmick (and a juvenile one at that) like over-the-top profanity. Whether or not the Calamity Janes of the time actually used the words \"ignorant f****ng c***s\" is something we will never know and is also absolutely irrelevant.\n\nThere are an awful lot of sheeple in TV land\n",
    "\nOK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can\u0027t be said for any of the human characters.\n\nThe insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?\n\nPeter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics\n",
    "\nI hate lawyers.\n\nWhat is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it\u0027s a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. \n\nShakespeare said it first and best: \"First, let\u0027s kill all the lawyers!\". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: \"get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot \u0027em!---in the mouth, so you *can\u0027t* miss!\" \n\nExactly. Anyway, \"The Firm\" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. \n\nBut not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. \n\nWhy did I consider walking Hell\u0027s Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel \"The Firm\": granted, I\u0027ve read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. \n\nI mean, seriously: you\u0027re 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?\n\nWhat\u0027s the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. \n\nNow it\u0027s true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in \"The Firm\", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. \n\nGrisham, like Michael Crichton, isn\u0027t a prose genius: he\u0027s not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and \"The Firm\" cried out for cinematic treatment. \n\nSo it\u0027s baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of \"The Firm\" is such a yawner. \n\nTalk about contempt of court.\n\nPollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, \"The Firm\" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I\u0027ve bet the farm on this gig, I\u0027m getting big money, I\u0027m working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I\u0027m not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I\u0027m doing money laundering for The Mob. \n\nPollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: \"The Firm\" is all funny-wrinkles when he\u0027s onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. \n\nJeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise\u0027s squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she\u0027s not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of \u0027em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm\u0027s security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. \n\nHolly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she\u0027s about 3\u00278, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn\u0027t help that she\u0027s a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn\u0027t. Pollack wants us to think she\u0027s clever and funny. She isn\u0027t. \n\nEd Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you\u0027re dealing with a bunch of friggin\u0027 crooks.  \n\nAnyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. \n\nIf you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. \n\nOtherwise, case dismissed. \n\nJS\n",
    "\nOkay, the script is not the most imaginative I\u0027ve ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben\u0027s best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn\u0027t even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don\u0027t they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn\u0027t even mind the fact that the whole \"We\u0027re married and my husband\u0027s a doctor.\" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he\u0027s pretending to be a doctor and he\u0027s on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D\u0027ya think someone might have a heart attack and \"Dr. Holmes\" might have to step up?  And uh, they\u0027re pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there\u0027s the best man and maid of honor! D\u0027ya think they\u0027re gonna get busted?\n\nWhat killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah\u0027s little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they\u0027re not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he\u0027s breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let\u0027s just go ahead and get married after all.\n\nHuh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn\u0027t have a clue what he wants in life, and I\u0027m expected to believe they lived happily ever after?\n\nNot only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us \"don\u0027t do it!\" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It\u0027s just marriage. It\u0027s romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!\n\nIt\u0027s been my experience, when things aren\u0027t feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap\n",
    "\nSimply put: the movie is boring.  Clich� upon clich� is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the \"natural\" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son\u0027s death. The lawyer has a drunk \"friend\" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie. \n\nSave your money, save your time, choose another movie.\n",
    "\nI rented this DVD because of the glowing reviews here and because I wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the Middle East. Overall, I was disappointed by this offering because it didn\u0027t give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject. (It also seems to me to be *a bit* biased in Israel\u0027s favor vis-a-vis the Palestinians, but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately.)\n\nFor instance, the documentary jumps right into the last Zionist Congress in 1939 (or whenever it was), but they never define what the Zionist movement is or where it came from. I know some of this from my reading, but it would be nice to have a summary here -- especially as it relates to the main players in the rest of the documentary. I wish the documentary would have at least started with WWI and the British occupation of Palestine after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, rather than picking up at WWII and mentioning some of the WWI details later. Doing so would have answered questions like, \"Why are the British so important here?\"\n\nAnother example is keeping track of the people, places, and organizations, which are often named in Hebrew or Arabic and are unfamiliar to the uninitiated. It made the sequence of events hard to follow because we had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what and where. Using more text on the screen, more maps, more recaps, and perhaps more English translations would have improved things greatly, methinks.\n\nThe film certainly has value, not least because it is told by a participant and first-hand observer, but it is not for those without much familiarity with the people, places, and issues at hand\n",
    "\nOther reviews rant about Ms. Judd; frankly, after Double Jeopardy and High Crimes, I\u0027m not seeing the superb actress, but that\u0027s aside the point.

    "\nok, I\u0027ve only just seen this film for the first time, so it\u0027s hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.\n\nI mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson\u0027s in it. and if you\u0027re a fan of dave chapelle\u0027s tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.\n\nbut that\u0027s really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they\u0027re ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine\u0027s road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.\n\ntake the french film \u0027la haine\u0027, for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in \u0027la haine\u0027 is quite a bit better.\n\nso while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there\u0027s a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn\u0027t try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one\n",
    "\nThese plays were okay, I\u0027m glad I rented them before buying them.  The props and things were very nice, the actors didn\u0027t gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre ( definitely no Tyler Perry quality on that note) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out.  I thought Alexander O\u0027Neal sang in one of them but he didn\u0027t\n",
    "\n\"In Good Company\" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.

There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.\n\nOverall it isn\u0027t an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace\n",

    "\nThe entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false.  The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents.  Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them \"again\" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply.\n\nIn movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK.  But this is a mainstream legal thriller.  It\u0027s like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don\u0027t, for no apparent reason.\n\nBut the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is\n",

Every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke, it\u0027s clear how forced and contrived it is, how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor, something they clearly don\u0027t understand.  It\u0027s embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch, because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat.  It\u0027s just an awkward mess.\n\nBut those aren\u0027t the people this show is targeted at.  It\u0027s targeted at that FOX audience who has never even seen dry humor before, and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them.  They think this show is brilliant because it\u0027s a little smarter than MAD TV, or at least thinks it is.  And since those are the people who are seeing the show, you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is.  If the show were on HBO or some other network, exposed to a different kind of audience, you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works.\n\nSo why did this show get cancelled, when so many people think it\u0027s so amazing?  If it\u0027s so great, people would have actually watched it, right?  So where were the ratings?  The fact is, the people who love this show are a very vocal minority.  The audience for dry humor didn\u0027t watch this show because it\u0027s not funny.  But the audience who was fooled by this show, as vocal as they are, was just too small:  they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it.\n\nThis is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for TV, as its apologists claim.  No, it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes\n",
    "\n\"Four Brothers\" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton\u0027s increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty \"Boyz n the Hood\" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.  \n\nThe main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys\u0027 thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.\n\nThe acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys\u0027 running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother\u0027s killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.  \n\nWith nary a single moment that rings believable or true, \"Four Brothers\" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.\n",
    "\nI do not understand what the hype about this dvd is. I baught it according to [] reviews, but unfortunatly, was very dissapointed. I def felt a burn in my upper abs, but you are laying on your back THE ENTIRE TIME. There is no changing positions and targeting the abs from diferent angles. To me, it was basically crunch after crunch after crunch. Would not recommend it unless you want buldge in your upper abs\n",

This may have been an error but I doubt it. \n\nIn PAT. the tachikoma\u0027s voices are so annoying and so much information is thrown at you that it\u0027s hard to follow. Most if is a rehash on previous episodes. With their childest voices, they shouldn\u0027t be used as a main plot of the story\n",
    "\nPersonally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn\u0027t understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition,  as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn\u0027t have to teach themselves the moves. \n\nTo a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the \"cheesiness\" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo\u0027s unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way. \n\nI don\u0027t mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun\n",

    "\nI found this movie to be almost unwatchable.  If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes, then this movie is for you.  The three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it.  Altman can pull off such greats as \"Mash\" and  \"Godsford Park\" and then stink up the joint with this.  What\u0027s up with that\n",

    "\nStrengths: Soundtrack by Christopher Franke, performance by Andreas Katsulas in 1st half. Interesting idea of weapons system.\n\nWeaknesses: Plot was mostly stupid. Tragic underutilization of G\u0027Kar as a character in the second half. Unconvincing sense of scale for the Leanndra (Why call for \"a healer\"? How many healers are on board this tiny ship?). Felt more like a pilot for a new series than a standalone movie\n",
    "\nDenise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn\u0027t kid friendly, and doesn\u0027t have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise\u0027s exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to.\nA good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid\u0027s fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them.\nMy kids are NOT at all happy with this program.  There are 6 \u0026 10 years old, and they were bored \u0026 turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn\u0027t understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children\u0027s exercise \u0026 fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,-  You MUST be able to teach \u0026 instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn\u0027t mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching \u0026 Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program.\n",
    "\nSixth Sense \u0026 Unbreakable are so much better than Signs, and I\u0027m sorry to say whatever M. Night Shyamalan originally had, he\u0027s lost. When Sixth Sense came out, he was tipped as the next big thing, but I\u0027m sorry to say, it\u0027s no longer there. In my mind, he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of Sixth Sense.\n\nSigns just fails miserably. The concept was a good idea, but the execution was terrible. It reminded me very much of Blair Witch Project, as in what little action there was happens off screen, and the torches as well. It\u0027s also definitely not Mel Gibson\u0027s best film. Even the actors appear to struggle with the dialogue-heavy script, and not really much happens. Apart from one brief glimpse of an alien. Oooh. Fascinating.\n\nThe problem I think that Signs has, is that it\u0027s already following many other, far superior, alien movies. Aliens attacking the earth has been done, and lots more memorable than this. There\u0027s also the overly religious theme, which the film probably would have done better either toning down, or scrapping altogether. It was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film. The scenes between Gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy.\n\nThe finale doesn\u0027t really make the film better. The discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious! Why come to earth, the surface of is mostly covered in water, and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour?! And then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology - and then can\u0027t break into a wooden house?! Are you kidding me? But the most ridiculous thing is not only do the characters not pay attention to the dogs, who sensed something was not right (time to get myself a dog), but the fact that all the sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect the aliens entering our atmosphere - but a BABY MONITOR can?! Huh?!\n\nA film to stay well away from. Thankfully, I didn\u0027t spend my hard earned (ha!) money on it, but borrowed it from a friend. I shall approach M. Night Shyamalan\u0027s films with trepidation from now. Oh, and when a director decides to give himself a speaking role in his own film, make it a SHORT one\n",
    "\nI was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there\u0027s a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn\u0027t for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since \"So You Think You Can Dance\" never had contestants who mastered it\n",
    "\nI saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there! Since I was bored, I found myself looking at other people there to see if I could get a read on what they were thinking, and after it was over I asked my friend what he thought. He said, \"Oh, it was okay\" but didn\u0027t elaborate. So let me: it was painfully unfunny, with jokes or punchlines that fell flat, horrible acting, totally predictable, and very forgetable. This is a movie you might want to rent ONLY if you\u0027re really bored and nearly every other movie is out. And even then, you\u0027d be better off to go home empty handed. There\u0027s not even much eye candy to recommend, which is a nice fallback if there\u0027s nothing else going for it. How people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling. Just because you like a movie shouldn\u0027t mean you give it 5 stars, especially when it\u0027s as bad as this one. I mean, I liked Freddy VS Jason, but there\u0027s no way I\u0027d give that movie 4 or 5 stars. This is bottom of the barrel\n",
    "\nAs an environmental scientist, I find these soft-science/hardball political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful. While they rally the convinced, having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful. To wit, about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage. \n\nAbout the \"movie\": it\u0027s actually a filmation of the presentation Al Gore has made for some time on Global Warming. In it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of man-made CO2 and other green-house gasses. The audience is bombarded with a long series of charts, graphs, and suppositions that make for a compelling argument - IF one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation.\n\nAnd this is where this production goes terribly wrong, the fact checking was terrible, the cherry-picked data was obvious and heavy-handed, and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause. Two examples: \n\nAn Inconvenient Truth asserts that a sea-level rise of 20 feet is a realistic short-term prospect - yet, the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the Western nations warns of sea-level rise in the four to 35 inches range in the 21st century.\n\nGore discusses the Earth\u0027s atmosphere as relatively thin, and declares that, \"The problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide.\" Hello? Thickness has nothing to do with global warming people. Carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from Earth\u0027s surface - meaning that the vibration warms the CO2, which makes things hotter. Further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense, since it doesn\u0027t play a role.\n\nMy warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process, no matter how noble the cause may be.\n",

I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, \"OK, I didn\u0027t see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I\u0027ll give it another chance.\" ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That\u0027s about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It\u0027s kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that\u0027s exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.

    "\nIt is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time.  This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame.\n\nIt was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson.  Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half.  The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty.  Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean.  The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE!  It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene.\n\nMost of the \"women\" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her.  Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I get it Jackson was \"such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual\" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that.  A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly.  \n\nThen there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares.  \n\nThere is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film.  I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been.  A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige.\n\nIf you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don\u0027t waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart.\n\nGettysburg is much better.

I have a 5.1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert DVD that I\u0027ve ever heard.

    "\nLet me start off by saying that I have higher degrees in art, art history, music, and Romance languages -- so I am an admitted \"art snob.\" Having said that, I would recommend that you try the Baby Einstein \"Baby Van Gogh, World of Colors\" and \"Baby Mozart\" videos instead of this Brainy Baby video.\n\nI find this Brainy Baby video to be slow, boring, insipid, condescending, and visually uninteresting; I cannot wait to put in something else. Wait, you say, isn\u0027t this about the baby who is watching it? Well, I first realized that it is truly boring (and not \"just me\") by watching my 6-month-old\u0027s reaction to it. (She is now 10 months old, and still does not like it.) She consistently snubbed her nose at this video; she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do. She has never had this reaction to the Einstein videos I mentioned.\n\nI tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old, thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better, but after 4 months of this approach, she still is not interested. However, the Einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning, and still do.\n\nHere are the specifics that I think are the problem. The visuals are weak and not bold/colorful enough. My daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys. The female voice-over is distracting and annoying, rather than engaging and instructional as intended. The flow is not as coherent as the Einstein videos, which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video. There is no charm or sense of humor, like the Einstein videos.\n\nNo, I do not have any connection whatsoever to the Baby Einstein folks. I\u0027m just saying that the Brainy Baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging. If you\u0027re going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby, buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together\n",
    "\nThe Long Long Trailer is a good movie but Too Many Girls is when Lucy and Desi were very young and thin but the movie Too Many Girls is awful and Forever Darling is awful\n",
    "\nMy friend bought this set and so I was able to view it before purchasing it myself, and I WON\u0027T be purchasing it. I had seen The Long, Long Trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies I have ever seen; one of those films where you can\u0027t believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do. We enjoy most of the I Love Lucy series, but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows; the aggrivating ones, and this film was just an overly long aggrivating I Love Lucy episode. There is funny humor and aggrivating \"humor\" and this was definitely the 2nd type. \n\nYes, it was interesting to see Lucy and Desi doing films together, but overall these films are just tolerable, and none are ones I would rewatch for enjoyment. Too Many Girls was definitely a B picture, really really bad in so many ways...poorly written script, cheap scenery; you never got the feeling they were in college, except at the football game, which seemed so similar to the football game the Marx Brothers participated in in Horse Feathers! Too much partying, singing, dancing; what was this school majoring in, theatre and opera?  It just is a really bad picture. Yes, neat to see Lucy and Desi and how they met, and see them so young together, but otherwise, a real time waster in my mind. The funniest thing on this disc was the cartoon extra!\n\nOf the three, Forever, Darling is probably the best but again that seemed \"lacking\" somewhere. The color was that beautiful almost surreal 50\u0027s color that I like. The Yosemite scenery was beautiful too. But I think the angel stuff could have been much better developed; he was out of the scene too long at times. The part I liked best was Lucy imagining herself in the movie with James Mason because it was quite funny. But the camping trip was just a very predictable mishap time that was too much in the I Love Lucy mold and I was bored with it quickly.\n\nI know die hard fans of Lucy and Desi will buy this no matter what, and that\u0027s fine. But for others, I advise you see them first...you may like them, but then you may see them for what they really are cinematically. There are lots better movies out there that I would rather buy! I Rate these 2 stars; one star to me is \"torturous\" to watch. These aren\u0027t THAT bad, but almost.\n",

As a mexican-american who has worked hard to take the right road in life,I was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic. Do we really need to come out with a movie for all of America to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race? Prison sex? Babies drinking beer? Young kids doing a drive by? Mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa? Please!!!! Wake up mexicans-americans! We need some positivity!!!!! Edward James Olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message. What message? That doing the things shown in this movie are bad? I think we knew that already! What surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on Amazon that this movie got. This of course means that no matter how much sense I have made,it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful. P.S....Let us not forget that I am not the only one who thinks negative about this film.

It\u0027s an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you\u0027ve already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don\u0027t let the promise of a \"nude scene\" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.\n",

It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his \u0027friend\u0027 off his horse. \n\nThe movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.\n\nI am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don\u0027t buy it. It\u0027s not worth 50 cents\n",
    "\n\nOkay, it\u0027s not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion.  It does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis.  On the other hand, the film lacks true suspense.  I was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn.  The baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum.  The pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn\u0027t stand up that well today.  The actors who took part in this didn\u0027t go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel.  Why there was a sequel is beyond me.  I recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but I was only five at the time.  At the most this is a rent not a buy.  I guess good for it\u0027s time but perhaps a re-make would pump some needed life into the story.\n",
    "\nThis straight-to-video\u0027s modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go \"undercover\" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it\u0027s resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there\u0027s a torture scene, (modeled on the one in \"Lethal Weapon\"), in which he\u0027s hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas\u0027 performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell. \n",

It was in the emergency clinic in the episode \"My Sister, My Sitter\" where the scene pans around showing the patients.  Smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down.  When I first saw that, many years ago, I literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like I needed a padded room.  She didn\u0027t even understand the joke when I explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of \"hiding\" the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable.  This DVD cut has been cut and makes Smithers reply about not letting Lisa ahead of him make no sense.  One of my favorite things about the Simpsons was that they didn\u0027t care who they offended.

    "\nRather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. \n\nMartha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck\u0027 besides the character\u0027s surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides\u0027 (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder\u0027s character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.\n\nThe image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder\u0027s protagonist\u0027s journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.\n\nFor this reason, `Heathers\u0027 fails as an exploration of the `Hell\u0027 of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly\u0027s Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty\u0027 as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat\u0027 people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a \u0027war on fat\u0027 (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.\n",
    "\nDull, dull, dull.\nIf I could have submitted a review and given ZERO stars I would have.\nPointless\n",
    "\nHow High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large.  I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech \u0026 Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing.  While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be.  When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clich�s that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society.  While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture.  I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times.  The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face.  Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clich�s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film.  Nothing was original.  Nothing was exciting.\n\nWas the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions?  I think not.  As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought.  Why?  Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film.  With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters.  That is why they failed as a comic team.  Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech \u0026 Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned?  What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together.  Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same.  I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive.  What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters.  The clich� jock, the clich� frat boy, the clich� Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the clich� rich white boy, just felt and were old.  Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality.  How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original.\n\nI must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don\u0027t want to go to Harvard.  They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage.  How High is a dark spot in Harvard\u0027s history.  Do you know what makes it even worse?  This film wasn\u0027t even created at or anywhere near Harvard.  Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film.  How High has no redeeming qualities.  Ooops, I stand corrected.  The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke.  How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film?  I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid.  Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud.  What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing.  There is no original story at all with How High.  Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a \"cut and paste\" film that had no backbone and horrid acting!\n\nI do not like Jesse Dylan\u0027s style of directing.  While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes.  The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example.  The Benjamin Franklin moments is another.  The unconcluded \"Truth Serum\" can be considered another.  How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency.  Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated!  I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan.  If he would have tightened the script, created unique and \"cult-like\" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential \"weed\" film in Hollywood.  Now, all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for.  Sad.\n\nOverall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed.  Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High.  The actors, all around, were horrible.  The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy.  Nothing was funny.  Nothing will make you laugh.  The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits.  The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life.\n\nGrade: * out of ****\n",
    "\nI\u0027m guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia. I had not seen this movie as a child; those that say it\u0027s faithful to the book must have read something other than Lewis Carroll\u0027s Alice. However, the kitsch value is considerable; cheezy music and costumes, pure 1985. That being said, the Jabberwock was pretty cool in that \"Godzilla-man-in-the-rubber-suit\" sort of way. Also, the set design was very handsome. It\u0027s too bad that the lighting technology of the time couldn\u0027t have been more varied; everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional. The film that comes closest to Tenniel\u0027s original Alice illustrations is the 1933 Paramount b \u0026 w version; it\u0027s not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on Turner Classics\n",
    "\n...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.  \n\nJohn Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he\u0027s trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.  \n\nA brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.  \n\nIt\u0027s like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.  \n\nIt\u0027s an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.\n\nWatchable, but barely.\n\nThe Player covered this terrain so much better. \n",
    "\nThankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.  \n\nAs usual, Uma\u0027s acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a \"star\" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn\u0027t have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn\u0027t mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of \"cool\" just doesn\u0027t do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.  \n\nThe ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta\u0027s scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock\u0027s and Vaughn\u0027s scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.  \n\n",
    "\nThis was a wishy washy attempt at the truth. The facts are there in parts and pieces, but it was not really put together well. Some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic. This DVD had an agenda and is not unbiased, and I think it failed at it\u0027s overall agenda. There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble. The truth is out there, and I think this DVD tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together. There were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this DVD, but this DVD is maybe worth a glance, but not a long hard look.\n",

And, ironically, it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews. The best part of this movie is Eva Green. Or, more precisely, Eva Green\u0027s body. I didn\u0027t care about her acting (I thought it was mediocre). I just sat there and drunk her body in, wishing that I was that lucky actor (whats his name again?). The only reason to watch this movie is Eva Green. If she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation, then I am glad it happened. The movie is visually rich. In fact, its so rich that Bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see. But I will take it. He captures and celebrates Eve Green\u0027s stunning body - every square millimeter of it(including her genitals - the movie is NC17 for a reason), to perfection. Other than that, there is nothing else in the movie. The story is utterly insipid, the old movie clips, the \"discussion\" of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting. The music is another plus point.\n\nBottomline, watch it for Eva Green\u0027s body. It deserves five stars. But the movie deserves only two\n",
    "\nHaving been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie\u0027s attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn\u0027t use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn\u0027t serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn\u0027t he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth\n",
    "\nRoger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.\n\nI\u0027m not going to review the plot because it\u0027s been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn\u0027t get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English (\"Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig\u0027s head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?\") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I\u0027ll pass.  I didn\u0027t enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn\u0027t enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.   \n\nTo add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn\u0027t make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it\u0027s true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of \"...I would\u0027ve won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking...\" or \"...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking...\" but I\u0027ve yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.\n\nLynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I\u0027d advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don\u0027t think he\u0027s motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C\u0027mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!  \n\nTo reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I\u0027ll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I\u0027ll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive\n",

It then tried to mix them all together in one film. \n\nThe main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.\n\nWe have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.\n\nThen it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.\n\nOur main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.\n\nI really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.\n\nAs for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.\n\nThe gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.\n\nNote that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here\n",
    "\nHART\u0027S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI\u0027s crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.  \n\nUnintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER\u0027S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART\u0027S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.  \n\nIn the story Colin Farrell\u0027s character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator\u0027s defense during the subsequent courts martial.  \n\nIf director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart\u0027s unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant\u0027s attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.\n\nHART\u0027S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.   A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection\n",
    "\nUnless you enjoy movies that are not funny, not scary, and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns, DO NOT WATCH this series of horrible flicks.  Putrid!  Not even \"so-bad-it\u0027s-funny\". Absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind!  Heed my warning!  SUCKS!!\n",
    "\nI cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we\u0027ve seen in films like \"baby boy\". Almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word. He didn\u0027t add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance. I don\u0027t know what this film was about. There are parts where there is a long silence with no talking. The whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house.\nThere are a few scenes where the characters are running around  without any obvious aim. The film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying, \"what was all that excitement about?\"\n",
    "\nHow anyone could rate this movie 4-5 stars is beyond belief. This was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere. As I watched this movie I could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. It was never very funny and both lead actors, playing one white and one adopted black brother, had scenes in the movie that were terrible. Romany Malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body. He jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings, runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them, in his drawers? He is talentless and idiotic as a \u0026quot;brother\u0026quot; in France that no one can relate to. Paul Rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and \u0026quot;grossly\u0026quot; tells off everyone - people he has known for less than a week! The servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well...but can\u0027t make up for the dismal rest. Ludicrous - a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama. This is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints\n",
    "\nThe movie \"Dead Life\" by director William Victor Shotten is a throwback to the great movies of old such as Night of the Living Dead--or at least it tries to be--unfortunately it\u0027s a stupid attempt and being original through looking old, which in itself is an irony.\n\nLooking at its writing, there\u0027s absolutely nothing to commend this movie on. Though this movie at least tries to give you an explanation as to the existence of zombies, it\u0027s as thought-out as a cat\u0027s decision to chase a shiny object. The common mistake made with Romero\u0027s films is that the story wasn\u0027t well thought out, since they never really explain the zombies (except a bit in the original about a meteor); however, what people don\u0027t realize is it doesn\u0027t matter why. Romero\u0027s films are satirical in nature, they focus on a larger picture and disregard details, that\u0027s what makes them so great--that\u0027s what makes them films.\n\nDead Life makes some attempt and showing depth with its underlying theme, except it\u0027s stupid and unoriginal, and really not shocking or thought-provoking in the slightest.\n\nThis movie is not shocking, it\u0027s not realistic, even the \"gore scene\" everyone is referring to is only a stupid attempt at being shocking and over-the-edge; but it comes off as just being tasteless.\n\nPeople are giving this movie credit for having no money, but really, people have done better with less. The acting is ridiculous, the sound is poorly dubbed, the camera is always out of focus, and the special effects are lame. It is a tasteless zombie romp with no point whatsoever, it doesn\u0027t deserve credit for having a low budget, it makes no effort to make people think and makes no effort to be good, period. Night of the Living Dead was a low-budget film, this is not even close to reaching that level.\n\nOh, and it actually takes sound effects straight from the first Resident Evil game and dubs them in. Seriously\n",
    "\nOkay I admit, they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends. Heres my problem, they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera, most of the scenes were blurry, every now and again the focus was clear, I mean c\u0027mon, when I was fourteen I made a short stop motion animation film using an old Bell and Howell super 8 cam and even then I paid attention to the focusing.Okay enough of that, now for the pros of the film. The make-up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most MEN wince, the outdoor and some indoor settings had a NOTLD feel. Overall I recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds, at least you can say you saw it. Rent if you can, if not, buy used\n",
    "\nFor years, I\u0027ve bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low-budget horror movies, but I\u0027d rather watch ANYTHING shot on video than watching the waste of film that is Dead Life. Don\u0027t be fooled when I say this movie is shot on film. It SERIOUSLY looks like it was shot on a 1950s 8mm camera. It\u0027s perpetually grainy, dark, fuzzy, and shaky, and not in an artsy way. My $200 video camera looks infinitely better than this. The video quality is appropriate, however, as it\u0027s matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this stink-fest. The sound is murky and undecipherable, the acting is strictly amateur hour, the characters are paper-thin with no distinction or purpose, the story is non-existent, the dialogue is a completely worthless bore, there\u0027s nothing remotely scary, and the special effects (including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a Commodore 64) are laughable. Or, at least, I wish they were laughable. That would\u0027ve at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this (high school) student film. It\u0027s movies like this -- cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy, but which get cherry spots on Blockbuster shelves because they\u0027re packaged with slick cover art -- that give horror movies in general (and zombie movies in particular) a bad name, and that make horror fans so wary. Disgraceful!\n",
    "\nUnfocused, repetitive, and worst of all - boring!  What should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame.  Ronnie Earle, the district attorney at the center of the film, says,  \"This isn\u0027t about Democrats and Republicans, this is about cops and robbers.\" If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say. Instead, from the start, The Big Buy feels like a film you\u0027ve walked into thirty minutes late. Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers, The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic, but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won\u0027t notice. Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story, to bad it\u0027s not being told here. \n",
    "\nWith the exception of disc# 6 this collection was very disappointing.  It was obvious that the show lost its charm after season #3 and was well on its way out before Paul Reubens little incident.   However, if you liked Pee-Wee Herman the first collection under Playhouse#1 is excellent.  It was fresh and innovative.  My 3 year old loves the first 6 discs.  Disc #7 to disc #10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase.  They should have included disc #6 with the first set.  Anything after that was simply not entertaining.  The quality of all the discs still is excellent.\n\n",
    "\nLeeches is a terrible movie.  Dude, I have never seen anything so gay in my whole life (except the director\u0027s other film Speed Demon).  When the guys were less clothes than the gals, thats not a good sign.  The video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director\u0027s work.\nThey\u0027re all filled with loads of homoeroticism.  Women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks.  The \u0027roided up leeches enter their \"male\" victims through anal orrifices.  After watching about a half hour of this mess I had to turn it off.\n\nWhy does this guy fool people into renting these movies.  I don\u0027t mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it\u0027s time to draw the line.  No hetro relationships in this one.  Just the director molesting his male stars with his camera.\n\nHorrible stuff, stay away from David DeCoteau\u0027s work and his fifty different aliases (unless you know what you\u0027re in for)\n",
    "\n\"The O.C.\" has got to be one of the most Overrated, Overhyped, shows that I have ever seen, this side of \"Friends\". This show makes me ashamed to be from SoCal.Their is nothing Appealing or Compelling about a bunch of rich, spoiled, suburban, white teens(sorry,I mean 24,25,28 year old acters playing teenagers) and their so called \"problems\".I admit,I tried to give this show a chance, I tried to watch a few episodes,and really, I couldn\u0027t make it passed the half an hour mark w/out turning it to Adult Swim or some \"Nick At Night\" Re-run or something. and speaking of white, is \"O.C.\" suppose to stand for \"Orange County\" or \"Only Caucasians\". I had no idea, that their were no Black, Mexican, or Asian people that lived in the \"O.C.\" Peter Gallagher\u0027s character is suppose to be the \"bad guy\" huh? Please! How about I snatch this chump off the \"O.C.\" streets, toss him in a trunk and take him to Long Beach, Compton, Crenshaw, or Watts and then lets see how \"bad\" a guy he is then.

    "\nI expected alot more from Richard Harris. He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn\u0027t enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai\u0027s name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess. Such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability\n",
    "\nIn Dr Yang\u0027s DVD I expected to find a good reference for my practice of the Yang 108 form, but I am very displeased with the quality of the DVD. For the price that I paid, I expected a least good video quality. When Dr. Yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor; there are close ups of the upper body and obviously, the movement of the legs is not seen; you get lost with changes of camera angles; at some point, you can see people in the background; and the stage is not properly set up. Also, and with all due respect, his movements are weird. I have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the Yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed. Definitively I do not recommend this DVD to any one who wants to use it as a reference, you can use it as a movie\n",
    "\nI have been a long-time radiohead fan and, like many others, have been waiting patiently for a live DVD.  So I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist.  It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old!  \n\nI couldn\u0027t help being disappointed when I watched this DVD.  The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch.  In fact, I only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust.  I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime.  \n\nI\u0027ve always that Radiohead was modern, progressive, and totally innovative.   I appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey... and it doesn\u0027t help that before every song, Thom mutters \"this is a new one.\" \n",
    "\nThe original \"Candyman\" sucks so bad, but everybody praises it and I kept wondering to myself, \"am I missing something?\"  So, I tried watching it again and it still sucked as I could not even get through it, so I figured maybe I should watch the sequels and maybe I would find something that I liked about this series.  Well, after watching \"Candyman 2\", one becomes cognizant that this series is just full of rubbish...again, the social overtones and politically correct notions present in this series make the movie absurd in the extreme.  The villain in \"Candyman\" makes me want to laugh because he is so NOT scary...if you want a good laugh, watch the \"Candyman\" series, but if you want to be scared, you would even do better to watch \"Ren and Stimpy\".  In all seriousness, watch \"Halloween\" and \"Halloween II\" if you want to see a good slasher and horror movie that really produces the goods and doesn\u0027t try to send a social message. LOL.  Some people call \"Candyman 2- Farewell to the Flesh\" a horror movie...I just call it rubbish\n",
    "\nLove the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up.

    "\nMy son LOVES airplanes and jets! I bought this DVD based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video. If you want a DVD that shows airplanes/jets flying, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The name of the video should be, \"Watch the Blue Angles Get Ready to Fly,\" because that is what this video is. In the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying. Then the next 25 minutes is NO FLYING just talking and showing the Blue Angles getting ready for their show. In the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show. My son has never made it to that point. He wants to see airplanes/jets fly and I\u0027m now on a new search for a DVD that will do this for him\n",
    "\n\n\"Kings and Queen\" is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.  \n\nThe film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie.  The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live.  The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party.  After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora\u0027s and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.\n\nWith a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, \"Kings and Queen\" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships.  It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching.  But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on.  Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don\u0027t know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over.  For instance, Nora\u0027s father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter\u0027s character that simply doesn\u0027t gibe with the woman we\u0027ve been looking at for well over two hours.  Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn\u0027t deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father.  Nora could be accused of being  confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place?  I don\u0027t think so.\n\nPerhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom.  But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here.  This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.  \n",
    "\n1. Make sure you set your film in some sort of terrible alternate future where all people are slaves or unhappy or kept under sedation or something.\n\n2. Have every scene take place in the dark.  And your underworld must be lit by 15-watt bulbs.\n\n3. Clothe everyone in black leather, particularly capes.  This especially works for the villains, but in the interest of equal play the heroes can be edgy and wear black leather too.  If they\u0027re villains, shave their heads.  Give them sunglasses (for the dark!)\n\n4. Copying Terry Gilliam\u0027s masterpiece Brazil, throw something retro like brimmed fedoras into the wardrobe.\n\n5. Have a premise where our hero, a lone, semi-geeky guy, wakes up or somehow finds himself in a world he does not remember getting into.  He must clear his name of something, even if it\u0027s just getting off Pottery Barn\u0027s mailing list.\n\n6. Have a Mysterious Woman who may or may not be in cohoots with the bad guys, but who falls in love with our hero and wants to save him by the end of act II.\n\n7. Make damn sure she\u0027s sultry.  Though blondes are generally more popular these days in Hollywood, here dark brunettes work best.\n\n8. Have lots of issues that revolve around our brains being dicked with.  Throw in lots of tortured dialogue about alternative consciousnesses/universes/fuel supplies/sugar substitutes.\n\n9. This is very important: USE THE RHETORICAL LINE AT LEAST ONCE: \"DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU [find the Kiber Crystal/try to rescue your love-interest/defy Dr. Morphface/turn on a bright light]?\"  Indeed he (and we) don\u0027t.  This is supposed to get us all scared and anxious.\n\n10. Our hero should have had, if possible, a happy childhood that turned tragic.  Slaughtered parents work great here.  Of course, he doesn\u0027t remember any of it, at least at first.\n\n11. Populate your world with lots of machines with tubes, wires, cables, and ducts.  There also should be flashes of lightning that serve no purpose.\n\n12. Make sure your sets and costumes were \"derived\" from some black and white classic film from the 20s or 30s--Metropolis, Caligari, even Frankenstein will do nicely.  This is both to show you have a \"legitimate pedigree\" and to cover up the fact that you have no original ideas yourself.\n\n13. Make sure all the bad guys bite off their dialogue and sound mean.  This is how we know they are bad guys, since lately both sides have been wearing black leather.\n\n14. The guy gets the girl in the end and the sun comes out.  Really now, do we have to say this??? (However, through most of the movie we must believe the love will be unrequited.  The dame should have a troubled history, though you must keep it vague.)\n\n15. Throw in some cyborgs.  You gotta have cyborgs. \n\n16. Have sets that are about fifteen times larger than they need to be, but which are largely empty.\n\n17. There\u0027s always the authority figure who starts out in pursuit of our guy, but who by the end becomes convinced of his innocence and moves to his side.\n\n18. There was some vague, recent apocalyptic event that destroyed most of civilization.  But be brief here.  Our audience may get to wondering how one guy saving one girl will restore all of civilization, and you don\u0027t want them thinking about that.\n\n19. Include a sadomasochistic scene or two.  The current favorite is to strap the victim spread-eagled on a rotating mechanical device and stick him with needles.  This movie likes to stick them through the bone at the front of the skull, a really stupid place to insert a needle (but then, this screenwriter clearly isn\u0027t a brain surgeon).\n\n20. Always have a big shoot-em-up climax with lots of explosions, steam, smoke, distorting of the picture with computer tricks, and loud rock music.  This is how we resolve things when we have no idea what the hell we\u0027re talking about or how to end the movie.  We hope nobody notices.  Generally they don\u0027t.\n\nFollow this primer, and whatever you come up with will be called bold and visionary by people whose filmgoing history doesn\u0027t extend before 1995, and Roger \"I don\u0027t wanna become critically irrelevant\" Ebert\n",

    "\nThere\u0027s lots of passion in Wide Sargasso Sea THE BOOK, but it\u0027s mostly emotional. It\u0027s an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master. The film on the other hand is just your classic, bad 1990s film, beautiful to look at, with lots of skin, languid copulation, heaving bosoms, bodice-ripping nonsense, etc and next to no substance. It has no artistic integrity whatsoever, as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the Jean Rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did.\n\nI was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character. The much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe, and it also lacked much enthusiasm. They were incomplete and contributed little, if anything, to the plot. The viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between Edward and Antoinette. Therefore, they should have either gone all the way, tastefully (no pun intended), or have left those scenes out entirely. \n\nNow with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes, which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book. But for those who haven\u0027t read the book, there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat. From the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family (despite the narration). Why did the ex-slaves keep laughing? (Something vaguely explained in the movie, though apparently fully explained in the book). Why didn\u0027t the parrot fly away? What made the mother go nuts? At no point in the movie were Mr. Rochester\u0027s \"issues\", as it were, fully explained. The man gets a letter exposing his wife as a Creole and dumps her like a hot potato, after (as Christophene explains) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place. What a hypocrite. Again, maybe this is the ultimate point, that Mr. Rochester is a snob and the archetypical Victorian Englishman and that Antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the Jamaicans. But none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film. \n\nSo, despite the beautiful cinematography, this movie is a hopeless muddle. I\u0027d highly recommend the novel by the way: a book you don\u0027t forget in a hurry. Needless to say I think you should give this insulting (to the memory of Jean Rhys) film a miss, especially if you\u0027ve read the novel: it\u0027ll just frustrate you, no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time.\n",
    "\nThe novel of Wide Sargasso Sea was  decent book. A re-writing of Jane Eyre\u0027s Bertha. But the film is really hard to tolerate. It starts out ok. Although it seems to start deviating from the book early on. Past the point where Antoinette marries Rochester the film turns in to nothing but soft porn and the acting gets worse too.\n",
    "\nThe lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real Edward R.

    "\n... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I\u0027ve been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He\u0027s made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word \"bro\" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it\u0027s clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can\u0027t hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would\u0027ve been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting.\n\nNow you might be wonderning: who\u0027s the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there\u0027s actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it\u0027s well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see \"Timeline\").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn\u0027t look so terrible, because everyone\u0027s focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there\u0027s even a sequel. \n",

Maybe it\u0027s my own fault, but I was expecting something more like \"Groove\", or at least something interesting to watch. And it\u0027s not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary.

    "\n24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980\u0027s was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way. \n\nMy main issue with this film was it\u0027s attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it\u0027s premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis\u0027s death was slightly in poor taste. \n\nUnless you\u0027re a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It\u0027s not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into.\n",

    "\nBeware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that.  Was real disappointed by 9th Gate.  This film is tepid, there is none of the satanic intensity/ambiance that you find in \u0027Rosemary\u0027s Baby\u0027 It\u0027s too Hollywood, surprisingly, considering the maverick presence of Depp/Polanski. Film opens well, with a suicide and Depp\u0027s opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence, but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere.  Exorcist 3, which I was equally disappointed in, at least was more satanic.  I won\u0027t spoil anything for those who do want to see it, but the showdown scene between Depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed.  Emmanuelle Seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a Demona. And the \u0027showdown with the devil\u0027 is a letdown to say the least.  This film could have been great but Polanski dropped the ball, considering he was the producer/director/co-screenwriter, and the film fails in all three areas. It\u0027s not horrible, so I give it 2 stars.  But don\u0027t buy this film, rent it only.  Buy Angel Heart instead\n",

The most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of Dane Cook. \n\nNothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging \"comic\" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical.

But being in a liberal arts college I have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following.  The characters and the situations remind me of the short stories I would write in the sixth grade when I was around 12 years old, where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb, absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you\u0027re wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating, inane nonsense.  The whole movie feels like ones 12-year-old self trying to write about adult problems that they\u0027re distanced from yet infatuated by.  This movie appeals to the type of people who like to read Catcher and the Rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their chain-smoking, wannabe-depressed but more like \"I\u0027m so sad \u0027cause I don\u0027t have a girlfriend\" indie-rocker lives into some sort of literary wellspring.  I think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing, it\u0027s unfortunate he can\u0027t just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic \"subtle\" messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say.

Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn\u0027t forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he\u0027s a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.\n\nBut the movie\u0027s not a total wash; after all, it\u0027s got a GREAT soundtrack\n",

Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration.

    "\nFollowing Live 8 i have to wonder if Live Aid justifies the euphoria that followed it. Most people if honest would say that on the whole musically it was pretty bland and as for achieving its aims-well that\u0027s debatable. What it did manage to do was make Bob Geldof whom no matter how honourable his motive were done quite nicely out of it thank you. Before this his career was on the skids and now he is a household name, knighted by the monarchy and very,very rich. The same with U2 pushed them into the statosphere and made Bono think he is some sort of latter day prophet. Same with Queen pushed them into mega-stardom. So do musicians have a conscience or was it the chance to get maximum worldwide publicity, push their latest album all for fifteen minutes of stage time. Sounds pretty good to me. One can\u0027t help wonder that they could all give there royalties for the past year and wipe out the third world debt without coming on stage and screaming \u0027give me your money\u0027.

    "\n\"Capote\", directed by Bennett Miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace, was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005. It is based on Gerald Clarke\u0027s 1988 non-fiction book \"Capote: A Biography\". The film starts by Capote\u0027s (Philip Seymour Hoffman) interest in the Kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime. His knowledge of the criminals, especially Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship. The writer is sympathetic and sees in Smith a strong resemblance with himself, yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim. Capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it. \"In Cold Blood\" was his most famous novel; the one that established him as a legendary writer. He was left overwhelmed, confused and unsatisfied, however. The movie is quite ambiguous, though. Characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive. At many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations. For instance, people are always laughing heartily at what Capote has to say, although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter. The setting and the music were both barely significant. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman\u0027s performance is highly remarkable, the actor\u0027s resemblance of Capote is questionable. Hoffman is 5\u002710\" and more stout than the slender, barely 5\u00272\" Truman Capote.\n\n",
    "\nThis movie is utterly unremarkable -- actually, scratch that.  This movie is actually VERY remarkable -- because of how BAD it is.  First of all, the protagonist is pathetic: it\u0027s impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful, weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems; all she does is cry and moan.  Second, the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers I\u0027ve seen in any movie.  Third, there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered, which disrupt the movie\u0027s flow and continuity; for example, the protagonist gets hit head-on by an 18-wheeler truck, and her car is absolutely mangled, but she walks away without a scratch.  Someone care to explain how that\u0027s possible?\n\nI probably would have stopped watching this piss-poor excuse for a movie if I wasn\u0027t at a friend\u0027s house (and there\u0027s the fact that it\u0027s his movie): I sat through it just to be polite.

They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It\u0027s a study in contrasts, and it\u0027s done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn\u0027t translate because of Hollywood\u0027s froo-froo mentality.\n\nHollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee\u0027s one-visit-mother a major player.

    "\nDont get me wrong, i\u0027m kinda young but i love 80\u0027s / 90\u0027s movies specially the horror ones.  I had great spectation for early Geoge Romero movies.

Gorge Romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry, but for today standars they are not, even they are not that good for most of the 80\u0027s 90\u0027s movies.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. Acting is not beleavible. It looks like the were \"acting\"\n2. The dialog\u0027s are not how people actually talk.\n3. The soldiers at \"Day Of The Dead\" are a shame, they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline. They behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups\n\n4. More than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other.\n5. I think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans (listening music, shooting, \"talking\" )\n6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment. Theres is not any frightening atmosfere .\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. The gore scenes are really good, maybe too much bloody. It shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated.\n\n\nSo far the only great zombie movie i have seen, beleive it or not is Resident Evil 1.\nResident Evil 1 has it all. Resident Evil 2 NOT. Resident Evil 2 is one those \"just shoot and kick\" movies and I\u0027m not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo.  \n\nSo if you want a gory movie, maybe you may like this movie, but the gore is just at the end of the movie.

    "\nI picked this set up despite reservations (reservations being Luke Perry and the guy from the Cosby Show) because of the creator J. Michael Straczynski. Unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff. \n\nIt\u0027s really nothing more then a C average show. Normally that\u0027s not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel (Showtime) and costs over $70.00 on DVD it\u0027s just not good enough. \n\nSpecific problems I had with the show include a lot of filler episodes. The season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line. The show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story (this is the model that HBO uses). \n\nProduction value is also sorely lacking. Once again I\u0027m going to compare to HBO (I feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks). The HBO series Carnivale has unbelievable production value, the set\u0027s, locations, costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality (the same can be said for Deadwood and Rome but Carnival makes for a better comparison). But Jeremiah all looks the same. You can tell the show was all shot in the same location, every back road and town look like they are in the same county.\n\nThe biggest problem however is just the premise. A post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get\u0027s tired fast. I had to force myself through the last 9 episodes. Luke Perry\u0027s quest to find Valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery. Simon\u0027s quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled. So basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent.

I see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters.  1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection.  The transfers are terrible and the sound is worse.  Come on guys, at least try to put some effort into it!!!

As long as more babies are born than people dying, their population goes up--VERY bad. The only way to eliminate poverty is LESS children!! Send money for that but nothing else. \n",
    "\nThe concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded \"The Girl in the Cafe\" turned out to be a left-wing political message.  I wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character \"Gina\"?  Gina browbeats the members of the G8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world, particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows.  Does the thought ever cross her mind (or the person writing the script?) that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of HIV/AIDS, all varieties of venereal disease, children born out of wedlock, etc?  Maybe Gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly.\n\nThis movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an R rating for nudity and language\n",

    "\nInto The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer\u0027s perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.\n\nI am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director\u0027s vision\n",

    "\nI generally admire Jennifer Aniston\u0027s work so I picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn.  Sadly, watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie.  If you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes, you would\u0027t miss much since nothing really happens.  If it\u0027s a comedy, it isn\u0027t funny. If it\u0027s a slice of life, the lives are deadly dull.  The emotional level is so low-key you suspect the entire group is on valium.  Jenifer Aniston especially, seems to have phoned this one in.   \n\nReal characters?  As it happens, I\u0027ve known thousands of real people over the years and not a one bears the slightest resemblance to any of these sad-sack characters.

    "\n\"The human race today is in a really bad state, mainly because most people do not want to wake up. They want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power.\" -- Miceal Ledwith in The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the DVD \"What the BLEEP Do We Know!?\" mostly for the engaging snippets of dialogue from scientists, theologians, and mystics. I also enjoyed Ramtha\u0027s DVD \"Create Your Day\", even though it wasn\u0027t quite as good as the BLEEP cameos. \n\nIt was with great expectations that I viewed The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions by Miceal Ledwith. Unfortunately, the plodding pace of the 57 minute DVD--as well as the ramblings of Ledwith--was very disappointing.\n\nLedwith brings up some great points in this DVD, but never goes beyond the surface. He asserts that thinking people have discarded most of the infantile tenants of the \"hamburger universe\" (i.e. the \"vault of the heavens\" overhead with the vault of hell underneath). Yet, instead of treating his audience as intelligent folk, he makes nebulous comments without explaining the \"what and why\".\n\nHe mentions string theory (quantum physics) and the \"true\" nature of the big bang, going on to say that levitation isn\u0027t a \"miracle\" but only a matter of superseding gravity with the \"Torsion Field\". The problem is that he\u0027s tossing about these terms in support of Jesus\u0027 words that \"ye are all gods\" and \"greater works than these shall you do\" without actually explaining the meaning or *science* of a Torsion Field and just how consciousness supersedes natural laws. (FYI: The Torsion Field is quantum spin waves of empty space. Einstein and Elie Cartan did some preliminary work on this theory in the 1920\u0027s. The Einstein-Cartan theory could possibly be used to explain ESP, among other things.)\n\nLedwith spends a good portion of the DVD highlighting the silliness of traditional Christianity, including the clouds and harps of heaven. He goes on and on about how a cloud is, in reality, damp and would be uncomfortable to sit on (duh) and that if one were to play the harp for eternity, they\u0027d wear down the fingers to the third knuckle. I understand highlighting the damage that traditional Christian thought has caused humanity, especially in terms of evolution. In fact, as a former minister trained in theology myself, I probably \"get it\" more than most.\n\nBut while poking fun at Christian thought is popular these days, you had *better* have some theological and scientific claims to back up your assertions--especially if you want to be a part of the \"thinking\". Christian apologists know their Bible inside and out, so if Ledwith wants to undermine their fear-based, illogical ideas he needs to do so with his supposed area of expertise...THEOLOGY. Heck, even at a simplified level, all one has to do is consider that if an individual set a paddle on fire and repeatedly hit a baby with it over and over and over, this act would be considered a barbaric tragedy condemned by Christians (and others, of course). \n\nYet, God the Father would do much worse by condemning humanity to eternal torment forever and ever? Apologists would say \"Well, humans CHOOSE to go to hell.\" The interesting thing is that the Bible says \"no man can come to the Father except the Holy Spirit draws him\" because his understanding is \"darkened\". \n\nThis is just one of the many points that Ledwith could bring up, but instead, he preaches to the New Age choir by ridiculing monotheistic religions (primarily Christianity) via nebulous assertions. In fairness, Ledwith makes excellent points, but nothing that you couldn\u0027t get (much more eloquently) from Marianne Williamson, Gary Zukav, Eckhart Tolle, Neale Donald Walsch, and others. Some of these points are:\n\n\"We are pawns tossed about by those people we perceive as more capable and enlightened than us.\"\n\n\"If Jesus were on Earth today, he wouldn\u0027t recognize his own teachings.\"\n\n\"Anyone who looks back at our history can only be appalled at the small-mindedness, the hostility, the barbarism that has characterized our whole traverse as a race.\"\n\n\"We don\u0027t realize how following another\u0027s image of God is spiritually and evolutionarily limiting. We don\u0027t even think of it.\"\n\n\"The flat earth mentality still corrupts and completely distorts our fundamental beliefs at the basic level still today.\"\n\n\"We\u0027ve never gotten rid of the Inquistatorial mind to this day.\"\n\n\"The answers we\u0027ve been given by religion are bizarre, emotionally charged, and childish.\"\n\n\"Heaven varies according to the broker (Christian denomination), but the basis is pretty much the same: earning credits for good behavior so you can immigrate to heaven.\"\n\n\"God is just a human magnified (in monotheism). We take these categories from the lowest plains of existence and impose them upon the Divine. As a result, we\u0027re left with something so sentimental, mawkish, and inaccurate that it bears no relationship to reality.\"\n\n\"Whatever God is has no gender. These childish images are holding us back.\"\n\nLedwith makes other interesting comments, but they beg for elaboration. One such comment is:\n\n\"(That) Jesus\u0027 death was to appease the vengeance of a savage God...this had NOTHING to do with what Jesus Christ did.\"\n\nI\u0027d love to hear his explanation of the crucifixion! Spiritual teachers such as Williamson have brilliantly explained the metaphysical aspects of the crucifixion of Christ. Does Ledwith have a clue as to why Jesus died? If he did, why didn\u0027t he share it?\n\nHe quotes Jesus by saying \"greater works (than I) shall you do\", attempting to make the case that humans are living far below their potential--mostly due to a flat earth mentality. What he fails to mention, however, is that polemicists and theologians debate the meaning of \"greater works\" (meizona toutn in the Greek) in terms of whether \"greater\" refers to quantity versus quality. (My Greek professor made a case for the former, saying that converts would multiply miracles by sheer numbers.)\n\nLedwith also perpetuates the biggest misquote circulated in New Age circles, attributing \"It\u0027s not our weakness that frightens us, it\u0027s our power\" to Nelson Mandela. The actual quote is \"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure...\", which was uttered by Marianne Williamson in her book \"A Return to Love\".\n\nOne of Ledwith\u0027s comments that I found particularly insightful is \"As human knowledge grows, the territory of God shrinks. God becomes a refugee.\" The \"God of the gaps\", as he called it, are areas that we try to fill with human knowledge in the attempt to explain what we don\u0027t yet understand. An example would be ancient paganism attributing lightning to the actions of Zeus. Despite this interesting observation, it\u0027s not enough to enliven the rest of the DVD.\n\nWhat separates the tight, insightful segements in \"What the BLEEP Do We Know!?\" from this DVD is that the conversations captured in BLEEP were the result of directors Chasse, Arntz and Vincente ASKING probing questions of the experts...questions borne out of the directors\u0027 own curiosity and personal paths. On The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions, however, Ledwith is left to ramble at the camera rather aimlessly, which doesn\u0027t make for good viewing and does not offer lucid alternatives to the flat earth mentality of the hamburger universe. Perhaps this is more the fault of \"director\" JZ Knight.\n\nIn the end, I couldn\u0027t help but feel like this DVD was thrown together in order to capitalize on BLEEP\u0027s popularity. Let\u0027s hope the subsequent installments of this series are tighter, deeper, and smarter\n",
    "\n\"Chamber\" was always the worst entry in the Harry Potter series, but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse. Choppy editing, horrible humor personified by the untalented Rupert Grint, smug acting by the equally untalented Emma Watson, poor screenwriting by that hack Steve Kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack Chris Columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience. \n\nSkip it if you can.\n",
    "\nPerhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln\u0027s various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books. \n\nHowever, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln\u0027s books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.    \n",
    "\nI go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this DVD to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if I didn\u0027t want to leave the house.  I was a little disappointed in this DVD.  I love Self Magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising.  The routines are broken down into four separate workouts.  The only one that involved any effort on my part was the Pilates-inspired section.  As for the rest, the other sections would have you do too few reps, I felt, to get your muscles warmed up, let alone reshape them.  I think this DVD is great for beginners.  Its simple enough to follow and it won\u0027t scare you away too soon.  But if you\u0027re like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine, this probably isn\u0027t the abs workout for you\n",
    "\nI looked at the name (Groovaloos) and I looked at the cover -- and my gut told me not to get this DVD. I went against my gut and believed the reviews; I wish I\u0027d listened to my gut. For those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey, you\u0027re right on the money. They can all dance, but compared to what I expected, they seemed mediocre. Here\u0027s the lowdown: (1) the sound sucks - they\u0027re in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine, but the music isn\u0027t loud enough to really \"feel\" something that makes you want to move, (2) they just seem like a group of people who don\u0027t naturally have a rhythm, but they\u0027ve learned some moves; it\u0027s SO not inspiring, (3) it\u0027s not edgy enough, and (4) it looks good if you\u0027ve got a group doing it, but when someone\u0027s doing it alone, it\u0027s just okay. Overall, this DVD was okay, but not great. Get it only if you\u0027re truly desperate\n",
    "\nI was a huge fan of the books growing up, and a lover of the period and Jannette Oke\u0027s books. I had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series. Well, I just finished -- and could hardly stop from yawning while I watched!  \n\nThe movie started out well enough.  Wonderful filming, great costuming, glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time.  No, the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie.\n\nThe scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch.  I remembered the tomboyish Missie from the last film and couldn\u0027t wait to see her older.  The actress portraying the older Missie just did not do her justice! While she was pretty, she read most of her lines flat, with little emotion.  The worst was the very ending, which was supposed to have been a heart-breaking moment between father and daughter, instead fell completely flat.  In fact, most of the scenes with Missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left.\n\nI think there were several attempts to portray Missie as spirited (like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant), but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid Missie we were continually seeing.  \n\nApart from that, the rest of the cast was average, with a few star moments here and there.  I can\u0027t remember the book very well to check for accuracy, but the story was so-so as well -- melodrama only reared its head in a few places.  \n\nOnly if you want to keep up-to-date with the series, I would recommend this.  Otherwise, I\u0027m glad they replaced Missie\u0027s actress for the next film.  Perhaps we\u0027ll get to see a more energetic performance.\n",
    "\nViewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time. Many of those films that stand the test of time are from the Fantasy genre, including Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. Would I add Neverending Story to that list? Hell no. The dubbing is atrocious (funny Germans), and the costumes and \"effects\" are flat-out bad. Labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days, and easily trumped Neverending Story when it was released two years later. The story and plot had the potential to be interesting, but the execution makes Neverending fall flat. And sure, Neverending Story may have advocated reading in the mid-80\u0027s, but Labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics, which is the next step up for mind expansion\n",

    "\nI hope people don\u0027t start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley\u0027s a great hero.\n\nThis movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney\u0027s involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair.\n",
    "\nFrancisco was right, this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust.\n\nThe review on the back of the dvd says \"jaw dropping, \" but the full quote probably reads \"jaw dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)\". There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters, ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant \"evil side of human nature\" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don\u0027t watch zombie movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice\u0027s How To pamphlet and said \"yeah, it needs some CONFLICT\". If these characters weren\u0027t so constipated and bloated I\u0027d give them a chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of \"social commentary,\" but that\u0027s just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully. It wasn\u0027t.  You\u0027d get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director\u0027s real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely undead. The rest is monotonous dreck.   I don\u0027t know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man\u0027s dramatic rags. \n\nAll that aside, the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads. Sorry, but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron.\n \n",

    "\nHaving enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can\u0027t fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic.

A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don\u0027t get it, and it doesn\u0027t mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?\n\nSince the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can\u0027t keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.\n\nRomanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It\u0027s not caring, not real, and not responsible.\n\nBut I guess that wouldn\u0027t bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself.\n",
    "\nI bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as \"Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC\" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.

    "\nJulia Roberts plays Ed Harris\u0027 young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris\u0027 ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife\u0027s cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife\u0027s life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe\n",
    "\nIt is a shame that American film classics ( like L and H)  get more attention and love outside of the US than in it.\nI just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces. \n\nTo acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap. plays beautfully and  is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don\u0027t want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films. If you love Laurel and Hardy this is the only way to go! Anything to screw Hallmark and the corperate monster!! Why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute half-A prints!!! \n",
    "\nPersonally, I found 8 1/2 to be one of the most boring films I\u0027ve ever seen.  It was a pretentious, self-indulgent trip down the director\u0027s memory lane.  I understood the plot, and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end, but overall was bored silly by stilted, pointless dialogue.\nHaving said that, the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching.  Perhaps 8 1/2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment :P\n",
    "\nOkay, this is a really bad movie.  That said, there are some moments here that are so over-the-top bad that they\u0027re funny.  The fake accents are so horrible that they become campy and the now notorious love scene involving Sandra Bullock is outright hilarious...and very embarassing.  How she could be making love without removing a single garment is a mystery, but the acting in that scene is ridiculous, as well.  However, it is certainly memorable.  Sandra Bullock shows up for another short scene later in the film, but her role is essentially a throw away part.  Then there is the sudden appearance of notable actor Steve Buscemi at the very beginning of the film in which he seems almost ashamed to be in.  His character never returns to the story after that.  By the end of the film there are so many plot twists that heartfelt boredom ensues.  The acting is bad, the budget is obviously low, and the script, which invokes the occasional giggle, is a quivering mass of bulbous drivel.  Avoid this film\n",
    "\nWhat do we do\nWhen first started watching wrestling in my early teens, Ric Flair was a hero of mine, he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever. \n\nSo when this DVD came out I got it immediately, hoping to relive my youth, but I realized something. All the matches are the same, there long and dull, the same moves are done over and over, and the matches only pick up when Flair opponent takes the advantage. There is nothing wrong with long matches, if that are done well, like the Iron man match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long, so it can show Flairs endurance. \n\nI also noticed Flair is so repetitive, all wrestler use trademark moves, but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life, for example, chop...woo...flair flop...figure four...cheat....win, that not a description of one flair match, that\u0027s every flair match. When I started watching wrestling I only saw his WWF matches, so it all looked new to me, when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are. Other wrestler have put together DVD, which shows a variety of different matches such as Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benito, Bret Hart \u0026 Shawn Michaels, all top wrestler adopt to there opponents, Flair expects his opponents to adopt to him, that\u0027s way all his matches are the same. \n\nThe only thing worst then his DVD is his book, I lost all respect for Flair after a read his book, it seem that he is just like HHH and Shawn Michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face, put does it behind their backs. He bashes Mick Foley for being a stunt man, who only does gimmick matches, so what\u0027s HHH, a guy flair calls great, can anyone name a good HHH match that isn\u0027t a gimmick match (WM X-7 against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight). He says Foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player, who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles. He critises Bret Hart for not putting over Shawn Michaels at Survivors Series 97, when he was called upon to job to Lex Luger before he left who the WWF. he refused and took the title with him to WWF, brining the WCW to its knees. \n\nAfter watching this DVD, reading his book, and seeing how his using backstage politics at the WWE now, to keep himself in the limelight, its fair to say the Ric Flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way I could have won 16 world title if I had my friends booking the show\n.\n",
    "\nNot a bad movie...not a great movie.  Ellen Brustyn was great\n",
    "\nI remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of HEAVEN\u0027S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke\u0027s New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke\u0027s characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they\u0027re hampered by two things: \n\n1.) The film\u0027s slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! \n\n2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it\u0027s the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can\u0027t be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It\u0027s too bad, because these elements could\u0027ve made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou\u0027s 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named \"Alafair\" by the Robichouxs, after Dave\u0027s mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie\u0027s ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn\u0027t want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: \"I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he\u0027d made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would\u0027ve been the sexiest picture of \u002796!\" \n\nTo be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there\u0027s just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they\u0027re about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin \u0026 Co. could\u0027ve dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they\u0027d whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN\u0027S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke\u0027s books instead.\n\n",
    "\nI\u0027m not going to write too much. If you need to hear more just check other reviews down here.\nFrom all the 3 episodes only the first one, by Kar-Wai, is worth your time. \n\"The Hand\" is well done and typical Kar-Wai. Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it\u0027s the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody.\n\"Equilibrium\" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin.\nBut the worst by far is the Antonioni\u0027s episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment. The, once, great director should have just retired by now (he was 91 in 2004) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces\n",
    "\nAfter seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts.  But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well?  My reasons for asking, the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie.  Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured.  Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she looked pretty mature for thirteen.  Then there\u0027s Selen\u0027as boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I\u0027m suppose to buy that he couldn\u0027t handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else.  Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast?  I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door. It was all too obvious that the original film wasn\u0027t taken into account when writing the sequel.  Not credible at all\n",
    "\nThis program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.\n\nThe art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn\u0027t look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak. \n\nThe worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the \"action\" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don\u0027t feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I. \n\nThis first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction. Save yourself the pain.\n",
    "\nI wouldn\u0027t normally write a review of such drivel but felt that I had to when I saw what Christiane Schmidt had to say.\nNow we all know Mr Gibson has got issues with the British (as well as others) - just look at that other pile of tosh - Braveheart. But here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous. The usual response is \"It\u0027s not history but Hollywood, it\u0027s fiction based on historical events\". But the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that!\nNow I\u0027m sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war, but I\u0027ve never read of the British burning down churches with people inside - Nazis, yes....British, no. But who cares about whether it really happened....it\u0027s only a film!!\nGood grief, next thing you know they\u0027ll be making a film about the US recovering the first enigma machine.....oops.\n",
    "\nLet me just start by saying that I don\u0027t own \"The Chosen Collection\" but that I do own the original releases of all seven seasons. \n\nWhy review this then? \n\nQuite frankly, I believe the combined sets to be a waste of money. I have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers, and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this - they are as flimsy as this set is, and just as breakable.\n\nThe set\u0027s discs appear the same as the previous editions, probably a rehash from leftover sets. A bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor, but since I don\u0027t own it, I haver never seen it.\n\nI spent my money on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" once, and once is enough for me. Buffy is a endearing series, but why throw away DVD sets just to have them \"return\" from the garbage\n",
    "\nThis movie is the most boring, uninteresting piece of garbage I have ever\nwasted my money on. The plot is stupid, the characters are dull and insipid, and the whole movie leaves you asking, as the credits run, \"So What?\" Don\u0027t waste your money!\n",
    "\nDirector:  Turi Meyer\nCast:  Tony Todd, Donna D\u0027Errico, Alexia Robinson, Jsu Garcia, Mark Adair-Rios, Lupe Ontiveros, Elizabeth Guber, Rena Riffel, Ernie Hudson Jr.\nRunning Time:  93 minutes\nRated R for bloody violence and gore, sexuality and language.\n\nThe third in the series derived from a concept by Clive Barker, \"Day of the Dead\" (they can\u0027t even come up with their own subtitle) staggers down the well-trodden path already navigated by the \"Halloween\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" movies: that is, taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet. The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish.  Donna D\u0027Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror.  Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him. \n\nThere\u0027s not a single thing here that isn\u0027t scavenged from the first \"Candyman\" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can\u0027t even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what\u0027s supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D\u0027Errico running around in a variety of tight vests.  The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D\u0027Errico\u0027s pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically.  Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone\u0027s stomach.  The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can\u0027t be bothered even to try something a bit different.  Clive Barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be, but he\u0027s right about one thing: the sequels to his movies are garbage\n",
    "\n\tThe saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series. I can remember the first time I watched the original created by Clive Barker, I luv\u0027d it, the same can\u0027t be said for this film. Caroline is last living descendent of the candyman, and he wants to end it all by ending her. All who watch this film and the acting of Donna D\u0027 Errico will wish for the same thing. One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it\u0027s because a little fragile thing like her can\u0027t take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she\u0027ll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}.\nAs far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it\u0027s a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien \u0026 director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn\u0027t save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little. \n\tThere isn\u0027t much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that\u0027s it nothing more to it. Over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable.\n",
    "\nMaybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking, but I doubt it. Since Vanilla Ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie, the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new. I went to high school with kids like this and I\u0027ve bought the Eminem CD. And there\u0027s a little more to them than the stupidity. But let\u0027s discuss the movie.\n\nAnne Hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in East L.A. (??). Seeing her boyfriend beat down, she\u0027s eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating. Then she goes to parties, gets into even more trouble and starts losing her Jerry Springer-inspired ghetto talk. The Mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there\u0027s more to his life than selling crack on the street corner, but well he\u0027s doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner. Actually, he\u0027s coming off like a gangsta Yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat. Yes, it\u0027s ironic that she\u0027s trying to dress ghetto while he\u0027s trying (not very hard) to dress suburban (wife beater is suburban?)\n\nThe movie\u0027s climax is a scene in which Anne and Bijou ask the guys if they can join their \"crew\" and if the gang didn\u0027t have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked, they sure have it then (and really, who doesn\u0027t know that that\u0027s gang initiation standard - started by the Hell\u0027s Angels in 1965). After that disaster (both Anne and Bijous say no - but Bijou takes a little more time saying no) the movie unravels as Anne Hathaway discovers her inner WHITE GIRL and her friends act even more stupid. There\u0027s a neat scene between her and Bijou Philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people, but it\u0027s one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie.\n\nThe one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate DJ Squalls\u0027 character from Hustle \u0026 Flow (and Hustle \u0026 Flow in and of itself) since that\u0027s a white character in a black world that doesn\u0027t fall into either extreme of wigger or Doogie Howser. He\u0027s just himself whereever he goes. He\u0027s someone the morons of this movie could learn from (but really wouldn\u0027t you rather just see them all shot dead?\n",
    "\nThis is a great flick for people who are irritated by sub-plots because there are none.  There is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie, so it makes for excellent escapism, which we all need now and then.  Since all the characters stay together, it is easy to follow along, so you can turn your brain off, it won\u0027t be needed.  Since it\u0027s all about the ship, acting wasn\u0027t necessary.  You can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of Russell and Dreyfus.  I felt pity for them as actors, and hope they can rebound.  The movie is shorter than most, so there will be minimum impact on your life.  You will remember nothing about it soon after exposure\n",

    "\nI think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn\u0027t one of them.  She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she\u0027s just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot.  The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward.  Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says \"We\u0027re burning butter.... yeah\" but I found it annoying.

    "\nThis movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It\u0027s a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can\u0027t hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of\n",
    "\nThis movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre, far less interesting than Pulp Fiction and even below the level of Reservoir Dogs. It is said that in the violent late Middle Ages street shows were  often staged in European cities where fake blood flowed like water, heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines  during an evisceration delighting  the crowd. It seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come  full circle from Barbara Tuchman\u0027s gripping account of the  awful fourteenth century.  Despite the abundant gore if the film had been  better handled it could have been quite good. There are  glimpses of its failed potential at different  points. For instance the scene  towards the end where the prison governor\u0027s head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct  copy of an actual event at the  Bastille during the days of the early French revolution. In sum, as a special kind of disgusting  art form it is interesting, as entertainment though Natural Born Killers sucks. I admit some  people will like it , no doubt the same crowd who would attend  public executions if they were available for viewing\n",

    "\nI was on a plane from Shanghai to Bangkok -- stop drooling -- and I was reading a book. On the TV, I saw Tim Allen chasing an orange cat. In the course of the chase, he dropped down from two legs to four. The effects, I\u0027ll admit right up front, were great. This looked far better than the old 70s (I think) version called THE SHAGGY D.A., which I haven\u0027t seen. But even so, it sucks. I didn\u0027t need sound or subtitles, and I didn\u0027t need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks. True sucking is like that. (Yeah, I saw the bit with the Scrabble board. \"I am Dad.\" Whoop dee freaking doggy doo.) It\u0027s possible we underestimate Tim Allen\u0027s ability as an actor, perhaps because THE SANTA CLAUSE was so unforgivably bad. But even so, this movie sucks.

If your a Tim Allen fan, please do yourself a favor, and get either the Santa Clause movies, or the Toy Story movies, and avoid this movie at all costs. Here are 99 minuts of my life, that I won\u0027t see again, and I am trying to make sure that you don\u0027t waste your time on this dud.

I haven\u0027t seen Monster House or Cars, but I hope that these will be 2 better movies, or maybe a season dvd of Home Improvement will be pretty then this. Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a lawyer, that dislikes dogs, and even has a case against animal activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard). And he is up for accused of trying to torch the California headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate Grant \u0026 Strictland. And he doesn\u0027t much of a family life, since he is never home, and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie? His wife is Rebecca Douglas (Kristin Davis) and they have 2 children Josh (Spencer Breslin) and Carly (Zena Grey). And he has an appoontment to Josh\u0027s PTA meetings, and even through he is reminded at work, he forgets. Carly is not only a is both Forrester\u0027s student and a budding animal advocate herself, and her brother is trying out for football like his Dad, even through he secretly hates it, and didn\u0027t sign up for the fall musical. And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant \u0026 Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times. The movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old, which would be impossible, since neither dogs or people live that long, all I can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes, and this is one to avoid at all costs.        \n",

Throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which, more or less, is what this prequel was.  Caddyshack II, Godfather III, and Bill and Ted\u0027s Bogus Journey, all horrible follow ups to great films.  So naturally I was a little worried that the film Red Dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film.  Any movie that follows a great film like Silence of the Lambs has a lot to live up to.  Personally, I thought that the first sequel to Silence of the Lambs,  Hannibal, didn\u0027t quite achieve that, and neither did Red Dragon.  It was a decent movie, but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first.  Don\u0027t get me wrong it did have its share of shock value, but since it didn\u0027t come first I had already come to expect that.  I thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films, but clearly their work shows otherwise.\n\t All in all, this movie disappointed me for several reasons.  As I mentioned before, the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that I, as a fan of the films, had come to expect.  But mostly, it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors.  I\u0027ve never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception. \n",

    "\nI have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not \"know\" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment!\nThere are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting.  \nNevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others.  It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement.  In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims....  \nIn short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average.  The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.  \nThe characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the \"fool,\" Ted Raimi, from the Xena series).\nThough the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  \nIn a nutshell, it\u0027s not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening\u0027s entertainment, and that\u0027s about it. \nNo masterpiece here... 2 Stars\n",
    "\nLet me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even \"boring\" to my friends.  So it isn\u0027t the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me.  It isn\u0027t the unresolved ending that bothered me.  It wasn\u0027t the violence (in short bursts.)  It wasn\u0027t the acting (the acting was pretty good actually).  But as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure.  I didn\u0027t care who was sending the tapes and I didn\u0027t care what would happen with the main characters.  They were unrelatable on just about any level.  This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3/4\u0027s of the way in and you\u0027ll think, \"wow I wonder where the story will go next\".  And then it doesn\u0027t.  That was it.  Very disappointing.  I don\u0027t mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there\u0027s SOME kinda payoff in the end.  I really don\u0027t understand all the acclaim that this movie got.  As a \"suspense\" movie or as an \"art\" film it fails pretty miserably.  The premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly.  Viewer beware. \n",

    "\nThis DVD sucks, all the \"fights\" are fake, retarted, drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time I\u0027ve ever had in my life.  I am now stupider for watching this DVD and buying it is on my list of regrets I have in life.  I wish I could say the only good part was.... but THERE WAS NO GOOD PART.  No shirts ripped off or good hits thrown, nothing.  I am a Marine stationed in Japan looking for a DVD to enjoy and this is what I get.  Where is the love\n",
    "\n\"Killing Me Softly\" has one of those scripts that just don\u0027t give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation, but the big \"twist\" at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable (unless perhaps you haven\u0027t seen a thriller before in your life). The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he\u0027s an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she\u0027s not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. The ending is like when you have a \u0027jawbreaker\u0027 candy in your mouth, sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour. It was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did, I have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly\n\nIn spite of all that, Chen Kaige\u0027s direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous \"** out of 5\" rating. But if you\u0027re a Heather Graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes; and for Joseph Fiennes fans you\u0027ll receive half naked perks.\n",
    "\nWhatever possessed Jessica Lange to appear in this mess will never be known.  The payoff at the end is a huge disappointment.  Jessica Lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in.  Gwyneth Paltrow is unbelievably bad.  But I think this is not their fault.  The screenplay and direction could have been better.  This could have been a very good movie along the lines of \"Misery\" or \"Fatal Attraction\" but it fails in every department.  As I said, the payoff at the end is a real disappointment.  This film is a waste of time and money.  Stay away from it! \n",

Which is probably why first-time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles. After all, how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry\u0027s Sally? Unfortunately, it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film is so uneven, and the script isn\u0027t particularly funny. \n\nThere\u0027s a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy.

    "\nUpon its initial release, the attention that Otto Preminger\u0027s \"Anatomy of a Murder\" attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems.  When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center. \n \nAttorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered.  Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped.  While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature.  Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him.\n \nStewart is his dependable self in \"Anatomy of a Murder.\"  In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film.  There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort.  Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay.  \"Anatomy of a Murder\" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story.  The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction.  For a film to run as long as \"Anatomy of a Murder\" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.  Yet, this is not the case\n",

    "\nGeorge Sluizer\u0027s original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema\u0027s most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you\u0027ve seen that version, you probably still can\u0027t get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its \u0027Lady Vanishes\u0027 plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.\n\nChief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying \"Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.\u0027 \n\nBut the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don\u0027t even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they\u0027re given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple\u0027s relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he\u0027s probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let\u0027s end on a joke like a TV cop show\u0027 moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can\u0027t do anything for this one. \n",
    "\nWhile some critics can argue with Dan Brown\u0027s research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci \"debunking\" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this \"Rock\" of male dominancy was built the Church.\n\nThank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus\u0027 actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men\u0027s Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain\n",
    "\nI enjoyed the movie even though I was only able to watch it in segments. The first time I tried to watch it, after about 20 minutes, the screen went to digital gibberish and my DVD player hung up so that I couldn\u0027t even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power. I had to unplug the DVD player, wait, and replug the power cord to remove the disc. Overnight, I decided I needed to replace my DVD player. However, the next morning, I tried a different DVD and it worked fine. It still works fine on all my other DVDs. I complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of Showgirls. Unfortunately, this one has the same problem.

Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I\u0027d have been more fascinated by the inside look that \"Devil\" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she\u0027s never quite devil enough.

    "\nDuring my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.\n\nIt\u0027s not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It\u0027s just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that\u0027s it.  I\u0027m sure the movie would\u0027ve been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn\u0027t really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.  \n\nDoom is the kind of movie you don\u0027t really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t forget to rewind the tape because that\u0027s impolite.  \n\nThe Rock never should have left wrestling.

    "\nEven though I would agree that \"Erin Brockovich\" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in \"Pretty Woman.\"  I am second to no one in enjoying a good \"David and Goliath\" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the \"true\" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich\u0027s story, in the same way that the \"Xena\" character is the main attraction in \"Xena: Warrior Princess\" (though it should be noted that Xena\u0027s wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).\n\nErin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in \"Pretty Woman\" (prior to Richard Gere\u0027s character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie\u0027s beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney\u0027s (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller\u0027s medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG\u0026E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG\u0026E (by and through the representation of Erin\u0027s boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.\n\nRoberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired \"work clothes\" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin\u0027s apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.\n\nAlbert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin\u0027s boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin\u0027s boyfriend-by-convenience.  The \"convenience\" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin\u0027s benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar \"bonus\" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a \"thanks\" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers. \n\nThe plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.\n",
    "\nThere are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this \"movie\" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is \"touched\" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more?\nThe plot, the \"humor,\" the dialogues, and the music are way beyond \"below average.\"\nThere is next to no nudity and there are no, I mean 0 as in ZERO beautiful girls, in this film!\nAs for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...\nSchool plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!

    "\nI watched this movie all the way through only because I paid $22.00 plus shipping and felt I should give it every chance to redeem itself. It is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings I would give it -10!! Rated \"R\" for what? Language? Adult content? I have seen Disney films more deserving of the \"R\" rating. This movie was silly, definitely not entertaining in any way and I threw it in the same bucket I put my dog\u0027s crap in when I clean up the yard. I am a Chris Isaak fan, have all his CDs and went to his concert on December 9. The fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately, even his music. I did not find the film offensive, I enjoy hard core porn. I feel this is a rip off, poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone!!!\n",
    "\nDuring my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.\n\nIt\u0027s not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It\u0027s just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that\u0027s it.  I\u0027m sure the movie would\u0027ve been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn\u0027t really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.  \n\nDoom is the kind of movie you don\u0027t really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t forget to rewind the tape because that\u0027s impolite.  \n\nThe Rock never should have left wrestling.  It was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans (and the Rock means MILLIONS) really miss him.  Come back home, Rock.  Please\n",
    "\nThe film has its amusing and even touching points, but not very many. The big problem with RH is that neither Ford or Benning are sympathetic characters. Henry is just the kind of self-important, ego-bloated, smug, arrogant, cold-blooded corporate ass that\u0027s helped step on working people for real, so it\u0027s really hard to feel anything for him, shot or not. He\u0027s arrogant even with a gun pointed at him, and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is, if you think about it, appalling. And his wife is, in a way, even worse; she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides. She goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up, and doesn\u0027t become \"normal\" ntil much later. Only their daughter has any heart at all. Maybe a better ending would\u0027ve been Henry\u0027s not making it, Bening going nuts from losing her stuff, and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should\u0027ve been from day one. Barely watchable. \n",
    "\nLove Michael Buble, but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience. Parts of Michael\u0027s head was cut off, and then; sometimes, his whole head was cut off. Most of the time, the camera man didn\u0027t expect where Michael was going to move to and you\u0027ll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get Michael back into the picture. I wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert. That this was just home made videos. This was definitely not worth $20. If you want a professional quality concert, I would recommend buying Michael Buble\u0027s Caught in the Act. Caught in the Act was worth the $20 bucks. You get professional camera men who anticipated Michael\u0027s movements, and parts of his head was never cut off like Come Fly with Me\u0027s DVD. Also, the sound quality on Caught in the Act was way better. Now, I understand why some places sold Come Fly with Me DVD\u0027s and had the word enhanced after it. The DVD that I received was not enhanced. Anyways, skip this one, and get \"Caught in the Act\" instead.\n\n",

    "\nDespite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality, this film is a complete put-on. The long \"set-piece\" scenes (wedding, Russian roulette, etc.) are much discussed, usually either in the context of being \"essential for character development\" or \"boring\". In fact they\u0027re a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills. Once he does try to move things along, awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another, you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth, he really has nothing to say. The actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film\u0027s awkward vacuousness, by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative, but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything \"happen\" narrative-wise. \n2 stars is rather generous, but De Niro, Walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting, albeit for such a misguided cause. Ultimately, despite some controversy, many of the film\u0027s questionable portrayals of Vietnam, Vietnamese, America, Americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy\n",

    "\nAbout the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music. The producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who\u0027s not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick, incestuous, and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in. If you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood, don\u0027t watch this\n",
    "\nWaste of time.  I turned it off.  The \"extra features\" were slightly interesting.  The actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing.  A vanity piece.  Why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating, badly-written melodrama.  Don\u0027t bother\n",
    "\nThis Pride and Prejudice fan was hoping for a modern-day movie with a storyline much closer to Pride and Prejudice.  Even Colin Firth could\u0027nt save this one for me!  On its own I found it sadly lacking in just about everything I look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor.   If you are a true Pride and Prejudice fan, I recommend buying the BBC series and the 2005 movie version.  Both are excellent.  I would\u0027nt waste my time again with this one\n",
    "\nIf this movie were set in the US, I would\u0027ve given it 1 star but the British accent, humor, and colloquialisms partially saved it...but not enough, sorry to say!\n\nWhy not?  Because despite a few mildly surprising and utterly contrived plot twists here and there, this film is still built on a particularly toxic myth: the desperately lonely and insecure 30-something single woman who is made to be as endearingly pathetic as possible for the audience to root for her inevitable finding by a Mr. Right.  Here, the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby, clumsy, and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing.  \n\nAlmost from the first 5 minutes, this movie just reeks of focus-group-inspired audience manipulation as it slogs through the same old trite cliches and recycled TV-sitcom bits.  Was there even ONE half-original character in this whole movie?  Don\u0027t remember any...maybe because I\u0027d like to forget this dreadful cringe-fest of a flick ASAP\n",

    "\n\nApparently, this is a film that many women, who have read the book, can make enjoyable. \n\nCharacters, including Anne \u0026 the Captain, display wooden acting. Poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in \"Pride \u0026 Prejudice\" 1996 \u0026 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality. \n\nBoth Anne \u0026 the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation, and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne\u0027s \u0026 the Captain\u0027s constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness to be responses of: shyness, thought, distance, hopefulness, approval, or alarm. \n\nYou understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story\u0027s ending.\n\nThis film has pretty scenery; such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often very unique and well done. There is beautiful singing in one scene, and even better, wonderful singing over the closing credits. \n\nGood period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they continued their fanciful, wishful, thoughts into rating this film. A reviewer, who liked the film, says she had read the book, and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film. A poor script for those who have not read the book. Awful directing made awful acting. \n\nI would like to see this good story re-made by a better Director. \n\nWell-made romance films are: \"Pride \u0026 Prejudice\", \"Wives \u0026 Daughters\", \"North \u0026 South\". Fairly made is \"Under the Greenwood Tree\"\n",
    "\nAll of us have a dark side.  Unfortunately AUTO FOCUS focuses on this small subset of actor Bob Crane\u0027s life and expands it out of proportion.  In doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of Crane\u0027s life and career as window dressing.  Even the screenplay is, at best, an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of Bob Crane and John H. Carpernter  -- since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice-accused murder suspect.\n\nIn viewing this film I knew that it would involve some of Crane\u0027s extracurricular activities.  My interest in the film was as a HOGAN\u0027S HEROES fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six-year series.  Bob Crane\u0027s professional credits alone would make for a good film.  AUTO FOCUS unfortunately revolves around Crane\u0027s so-called \"secret life\" and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd.\n\nFacts are facts and there are established truths about Bob Crane\u0027s private life.  AUTO FOCUS, however, should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine.  You are better off spending your time and money buying the DVD releases of the HOGAN\u0027S HEROES television series.\n\n\n\n",
    "\nI was optimistic for Greg Kinnear once.  He was very funny ragging on Soap Soup.  He usually plays the nice-guy second banana in film or a man dying of AIDS.  Auto Focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960\u0027s TV icon, Hogan, in Hogan\u0027s Heroes.  The replication of the original cast is a bit eerie.  After all, these actors dress up as German prison guards.  A chill goes down my spine, but Hogan\u0027s was a comedy, which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny SS guys.  Anyhow, Bob Crane played Hogan for six years and Kinnear badly imitated.  Yes, I\u0027m sorry to say, Kinnear is awful as Crane, which puts a damper on the bio-flick.\n\nHere\u0027s a disc jockey with semi-hip 60\u0027s patter on the air with an All American family, a loving wife and cute kids.  They live like Ozzie and Harriet in the LA burbs, going to Catholic Church on Sunday.  Crane lands his big break, falling for the trappings of fame.  Most people fall for the trappings of fame.  Read the supermarket check out magazine racks.  So all of a sudden, Crane\u0027s garage porn collection isn\u0027t enough.  Women, very beautiful, Hollywood loose-morals women find Crane and his buddy William Defoe irresistible.  The birth of the video camera comes into play.\n\nThe trouble with the script or maybe it\u0027s the cardboard way Kinnear acts, we watch, but in the end, we don\u0027t care.\n",
    "\nThis has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the \"chewing up the scenery\" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else\n",
    "\nI just watched this movie version of the classic childrens\u0027 book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:\n\nFirst, very little is true to the book.  That\u0027s not really a gut impression.  That\u0027s the impression I got hearing my wife say \"That\u0027s not in the book...that\u0027s not in the book...\"\n\nActually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.   \n\nI expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I\u0027m watching.  You get to see...\n \nA kid chasing a ticket through a train,\n \nA kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,\n \nA ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,\n\n(Forty minutes into this movie and one girl\u0027s train ticket is the star of the show!)\n\nOK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...\n\nA train sliding out of control on the ice,\n\nA train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,\n\nA train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the \"coaster tycoon\" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole. \n\nThen, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...\n\nA train car running out of control through Santa\u0027s village,\n\nKids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...\n\nKids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa\u0027s sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.\n\nAt least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It\u0027s like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it\u0027s awful but you can\u0027t look away!  \n\nAnd, you\u0027d better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn\u0027t.\n\nSo, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens\u0027 Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn\u0027t advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a \"character driven\" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.\n\nI\u0027d rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids. \n\n  \n\n\n\n",
    "\nThe picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times.  So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant.   What a disappointment!  The movie\u0027s tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy.  There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?)  who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as \"Do you believe in Ghosts?\"  The \"lighter\" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling.  Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D.  Yet \"The Polar Express\" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.     \n",
    "\nThis film is a tough one to review. The film itself is amazing. So therefore, I should give it high marks. The problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos, and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature (as if we came from outer space or something). That is a bad and dangerous message, and so I feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that.\n\nAmazing footage, but ultimately does nothing but further the sensationalism required to seek and destroy more animals and natural habitats. How many grizzlies are hunted down and killed every year vs. how many humans are killed by grizzlies every year? Then take into account the fish we killed off because of dams, pollution, and over fishing that destroy the bears food source.\n\nHow many grizzlies kill humans vs. how many cars kill humans? Shouldn\u0027t we all be more scared of cars?\n\nI agree with the other reviewers that have said that this guy is cracked and self-serving. We can co-exist with nature, but not in the way this nutjob tries to do it. Native Americans (whom we also destroyed) co-existed with them for thousands of years. They respected the grizzly. This guy no more respects the grizzly than does the cancerous civilization he condemns.\n\nTreadwell was very conflicted and troubled. Not that we aren\u0027t all troubled, not that we all don\u0027t deal with failure and disappointment, not that a good rant doesn\u0027t make you feel better from time to time, but he had a death wish, and this was really just suicide by bear the way I saw it. Am I the only one that noticed he seemed very at odds with his sexuality? Lastly, in some of the interviews, well, they were just weird and contrived, like they were acting. These weird people in this film do nothing but harm the cause\n",
    "\nWasted talent.  None of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying.  Some funny stuff.  Craig Ferguson can do better.  Charlotte Church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte.  Every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters\n",
    "\nThere\u0027s a reason why they talk about the \"Voice of an Angel\" -- it\u0027s because Charlotte Church certainly doesn\u0027t have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut \"I\u0027ll Be There\" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.\n\nSeventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.\n\nThe problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn\u0027t want her child to follow in her father\u0027s footsteps.\n\n\"I\u0027ll Be There\" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because \"I\u0027ll Be There\" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler\u0027s life is interesting.\n\nWith a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn\u0027t have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager\u0027s absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it\u0027s an obvious ploy to show off Church\u0027s vocal skills. \n\nThe best that can be said of Church\u0027s performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it\u0027s a shame that the movie didn\u0027t focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.\n\nMiss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. \"I\u0027ll Be There,\" but I promise I\u0027ll get out as soon as I can\n",
    "\nThe old DVD from 1997 looks better than the new HD version. I\u0027ve compared the two, and the first DVD had good color saturation, dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette. The HD version has a blue-green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright. They also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy. The sound quality is better now, though, and the image of course is higher resolution.\n",
    "\nThis was probably the worst Royal Rumble in history. It featured three very bad matches, one decent one, a lousy Royal Rumble and an absolutely amazing match.\n\nBrock Lesnar vs. Big Show, Royal Rumble Qualifier\nThis match was absolutely awful. The Big Show is a decent wrestler, but Brock Lesnar is absolutely terrible. A predictable ending made this match all the worse. This match is like watching a tumble weed.\n\nThe Dudley Boys (C) vs. William Regal and Lance Storm\nThis was a fairly decent match. Regal and Storm are very good wrestlers and in the tag team forum, the Dudleys can hold their own. Its sad though that this was the second best match on the card. Nice surprise ending though.\n\nTorrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie\nIf you take out the fact that Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie are very nice to look at, this match is worthless. Unless you are really bored dont even bother watching this.\n\nTriple H (C) vs. Scott Steiner\nTriple H did all he could to save this one, but Steiner really cant wrestle anymore. I remember back in the early 90s where Scott Steiner was one of the best wrestlers in the game. Now he can hardly even move. This match really isnt worth seeing, yet its still better than some of the other matches on the card.\n\nKurt Angle (C) vs. Chris Benoit\nThere is no way to fairly describe this match. It was outstanding, phenomenal, amazing, incredible, brilliant. These two guys know how to wrestle and they put on a clinic. This match is easily one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time, and shows that you dont need steroids and steel chairs to put on an amazing match. Angle and Benoit are the two best wrestlers in the business and this match is proof.\n\n2003 Royal Rumble Match\nThis match was decent alright. There werent any really good spots. It was fairly boring all the way through, and highly predictable. It got a little interesting when the final five were in, Rob Van Dam, Kane, Undertaker, Batista and Lesnar. Unfortunately, Lesnar is an awful wrestler and he looked pathetic out there with other talented wrestlers. A guy like Brock should never be in the Royal Rumble. It\u0027s sad when the worst wrestler by far in the match wins.\n\n\nIts sad that an event with one of the greatest matches of all time gets only a 2 out of 5 rating, but theres nothing much to watch here other than Benoit/Angle. As I said, the Rumble was poor, the undercard was weak, and several of the matches were downright awful. The Benoit DVD has the Angle/Benoit match. Buy that. This isnt worth your money\n",
    "\nLet\u0027s face it; some of the jokes are funny. The one about Mike Tyson been like someone else\u0027s bulldog let loose in the room was really funny. I also found the bit about Bill Clinton and Osama Bin Laden also funny. However, Jamie dwells too much on the fart joke. How can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes? After 2 min it becomes worn and so \"unfunny\". Why does he repeat himself so much with that line, \"I am not saying she\u0027s a crackhead, just a bit crackish\"? It sounds very rehearsed after the second time. If it were only for these errors I would have found the jokes altogether acceptable.\n\nWhat I found completely unacceptable were the racist jokes that he made against Arabs. I am black myself but found some of the jokes about Islam and Arabs to be in bad taste. Jamie could not even get an Arab accent right. C\u0027mon, guys the accent Jamie pulled was an Indian accent and not an Arab accent.\n\nI kept asking myself, \"what would black people do if a white comedian (say Robin Williams) makes the same crude jokes about black people?\" Would it be acceptable?\". I think not. I am sure the black press would slaughter Robin if he did. I wish to call a spade a spade. Nonsensical, crude racist jobs against any ethnic group (black, white, Asian and yes Arabs) are not funny. They degrade and demean. For not even managing to get an Arabic accent, Jamie deserves 2 stars from me.\n",
    "\nI enjoy the initial season of Murder She Wrote very much.  My wife and I are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to Who Dun IT.  Frequently, though, it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up.  Often the audio gets out of synch with the video.  Terrible!

    "\nBut for me at least, I found it rather hard to root for Mel Gibson\u0027s character, given the fact that he was a major, major drug dealer.  When the movie ended with him more or less riding off into the sunset with Michelle Pfeiffer and all the loot, I didn\u0027t find myself feeling exactly uplifted by it.  Given the fact that the movie bent over backwards to depict Gibson as a loving father, a phenomenally successful businessman, and a super-stud, one might fairly say that this movie glamorizes drug-dealing\n",

About half way through \u0027The Big One\u0027, I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn\u0027t know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films\n",

Well The script was terrible,  the story even worse,  direction - don\u0027t get me started.   One reviewer said it,  it was like they didn\u0027t know whose point of view to choose.  The soundtrack was awful.  The ending was sooo stupid.  did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them...  they just keep standing there.  Like nothing is happening.  I really haven\u0027t seen a movie this bad in... well...  EVER!!  Oh and Alyson Hannigan\u0027s acting was way better in My stepmother is an alien. I think she was about 13 in that role.  Don\u0027t get me wrong she\u0027s a extremely talented actress...  I blame it on the script.\n\nrent it,  don\u0027t buy it.

    "\nThis movie was a bit lame for me.  Robin Williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie, and the supporting cast wasn\u0027t much better, but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen.  Even if this had been a good movie, the green screen was very distracting.  I would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff\n",
    "\nI was so disappointed with this video. I thought it would contain more than it did, but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all.\nI had one ashtanga yoga lesson and expected this video to at least cover what the lesson did, but it fell far short.\nThis only contains two very basic sequences - surya namaskara A \u0026 B, it doesn\u0027t even go into the full series and I do not think it gives a very good representation of what ashtanga is about. There is no instruction in standing or sitting poses at all! The two sequences are introductory sequences that lead into the poses, but this video just stops abruptly at that point... \nI found ashtanga to be a wonderful blend of relaxing yoga that also gives a full body workout. As soon as I did it, I felt that I had found the perfect exercise and bought this video as a way to practice at home.\nI ended up giving this video away after watching it twice as it does not contain enough information for the beginner to be inspired or even motivated to study ashtanga further\n",

    "\nThis is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times. The Owens girls are hereditary witches, any man who loves one is doomed to an early death. There is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion, this requires the sacrifice of a dove. Two little girls watch. Years later they\u0027re grown up. One leaves to live with her boyfriend. But the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck (never stand in the middle of a road). We see scenes where the neighbor kids yell \"witch\", as if to symbolize something.\n\nSally goes when Jillian calls her; she has a problem with her boyfriend. But Sally uses a \"magic potion\" to eliminate the problem. Now Jillian wants to undo what was done. [The film began to lose me now, it wasn\u0027t funny.] The spell goes awry, they bury their mistake. Then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles. Later an investigator comes around looking for Jimmy. [The story drags again.] More scenes follow; they are not funny or scary or even entertaining. But a scene in the attic will wake you even if you\u0027re snoozing! They call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of Jillian. It seems to work, even if they don\u0027t use the standard issue witches broom. There is a sort of happy ending.\n\nSandra and Nicole are good actresses, but they can\u0027t cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies I\u0027ve ever seen. \"Bell, Book, and Candle\" is a funnier film, \"Blair Witch\" is a scarier film. This falls between the cracks.\n",
    "\nOK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can\u0027t be said for any of the human characters.\n\nThe insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?\n\nPeter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics\n",
    "\nAfter I read Erik Larson\u0027s wonderful book \"The Devil in the White City\" I was fascinated by the brief glimpses at Holmes\u0027 story. But this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment. The production is amateurish at best, complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of \"Mondo Carne.\" With such a wealth of fascinating information available (court transcripts, etc) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened? This man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. Truly disappointing. Perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of Holmes. This most certainly isn\u0027t it\n",
    "\nThis movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It\u0027s a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can\u0027t hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of\n",
    "\nThis is my number one most overrated movie of all time.  We saw it at a pretensious artsy theater, along with an assortment of ex-hippies and wooly haired intellectuals.  They all cheered, of course, when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water, then becomes the chief.  The truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable, given the politically correct theme.  The truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture.  The truth is that tradition is not inherently evil.  The truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys.  Basically, if you hate men, this is the flick for you.  But it is not good.  It is not creative.  There are no surprises.  There is just nothing there.  As I edit this, it\u0027s no surprise to find so few people liked this review.  There are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so-and-so\u0027s out there\n",
    "\nHELLO?????\n\nWhoever mastered this great film RUINED it by FORGETTING or REFUSING to provide English subtitles for the Japanese and Italian characters.  How can such a thing happen?

    "\nThis disc is like a Whitman\u0027s candy sampler:  It has a lot of different things... but a lot of the things you don\u0027t really want.  The film covers kids, high schoolers, college ball and college recruiting/pay controversies, ABA, NBA through all its decades, Harlem Globetrotters, the street game and inner-city stars, country boys, Indiana basketball, retired old timers hanging in Florida, current stars, marketing (are there ANY hoop videos that don\u0027t talk about sneaker brands), public relations, fireworks, cheerleaders, guys on trampolines, women\u0027s basketball..... Whew.  None of these subjects is studied in depth.  If you\u0027ve followed basketball for a while, you know and have seen most of this.  The subject sampling seems to jump all over the place, so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want.  I\u0027d rather see a DVD star profile (Jordon, Iverson) or \u0026quot;NBA at 50\u0026quot; or Spike Lee\u0027s movie, or \u0026quot;Hoop Dreams,\u0026quot; etc.  1 Love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a Wilson basketball.  Or it seems like something you\u0027d see on Sunday TV, after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends.  In short, \u0026quot;1 Love\u0026quot; is a decent sampling, but nothing to sink your teeth into\n",
    "\nControversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the \"desperate\", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore.\n",
    "\nComedy comes in many forms--everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire--and in \"Just Friends\" there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types.  First, the movie wants to be a gross-out comedy.  The sight gags are plentiful, the physical comedy abundant and often cruel, and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic.  However, the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy--the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart.  These elements have been combined successfully in the past--\"There\u0027s Something About Mary\" jumps right to mind.  Here, we get something far less successful.\n\nFirst, the good news.  There are legitimate laughs to be had in \"Just Friends\" and that was a pleasant surprise.  If you don\u0027t care about character development and just want inane humor, you could do worse than this movie.  And if the sight of Ryan Reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you--check this out right away.\n\nSadly, it\u0027s the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite.  There is nothing real at stake here to care about--and the blame for this falls squarely on Reynolds\u0027 character (I\u0027ll use the word character lightly here).  Reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working--the problem, however, is that he\u0027s not in sitcoms anymore.  He\u0027s making movies, unfortunately--and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character.  Here, he plays a celebrity insider--a successful, trendy record executive.  And yet, he\u0027s not believable as trendy, successful or professional.  His character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero, you never know or understand him--he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag.\n\nIt\u0027s too bad, really, because Amy Smart--as his love interest--IS playing a character.  I\u0027m not usually a fan, but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down.  But it\u0027s Anna Faris that I\u0027m going to single out for the most inspired performance.  The funniest bits to me revolve around her character--a shallow, insane pop star.  Sure, it\u0027s an easy target--but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious, over-the-top gusto that she is easily a cast standout.\n\nAgain, some humor--no emotion.  If you don\u0027t expect much from your comedy, you might just like this.  The fatal flaw for me is that I felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship, but didn\u0027t do anything to make it REAL.\n",

    "\nI bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises. I love Karen Voight but this dvd was definately the worst I have yet to purchase of hers. All the other Karen Voight I own I absolutely love\n",
    "\nI think this film wants to make you vomit. I don\u0027t know about you, but that is not a quality I am looking for in my films. Being scared is fine; being in suspense is great, vomiting is not. I really think that is what this film was going for. It has some pretty disgusting moments. While I was watching it I kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes. In fact, I am feeling it now as I write this review and think about the movie.\n\nThe story runs like this: A meteor falls to earth. It has an alien life in it which shoots into people and uses them as an incubation device. This of course means then when the aliens decide to hatch out of incubation...well its not a pretty picture as you may imagine. In the meantime the people who have aliens incubating inside them turn into rotting-corpse looking creatures, or in the case of the head alien, just a big pile of disgustingness.\n\nThe idea itself isn\u0027t a bad one, and its executed in a relatively skillful way. In fact, the idea is much more original than many other horror movies. But as I said before, it\u0027s just too disgusting to be really enjoyable. This movie was confused as to whether it wanted to be a comedy or a horror and while it was trying to figure that out it failed in both categories\n",
    "\nI received this DVD from my brother who is possibly a bigger Kevin Smith fan than I am. I thought the fact that he was  giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until I watched the DVD myself. \n\nThe Degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and Jay and Silent Bob\u0027s toned-down appearances don\u0027t help much. I really liked the original Degrassi series so I was disappointed by this DVD. \n\nThere are some funny moments in the \"Extras\" section of the DVD but I would still only recommend this as a \"rent\" or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan.   \n\n",
    "\nThe video in this DVD looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a DVD disc. A standard 4.7GB disc, by the way; that\u0027s what you\u0027ll get when you buy this.\n\nI say this because I\u0027ve used those programs before and know how they alter the video. This is how they alter it, and how it looks on this USA release of the DVD:\n\nSkin color is too red. Dark (shadowed) areas are greenish. White/beige is pinkish. Grey is bluish. White has blue on it. The colors are just totally messed up.\n\nEvidence of grey being blue \u003d look at Robert Duvall\u0027s uniform (you\u0027ll see him 3 minutes into the movie). The german uniform is a semi-light grey. It is too dark and filled with blue.\n\nThen look behind him at the wall. A lovely dark shadow of green.\n\nEvidence of white/beige being pinkish, when Robert Duvall walks into that office, look at the walls. They should be a kind of white/beige color but they are not a shade of white at all, they are pinkish.\n\nAs he walks into the office to sit down, you see curtains on the wall in the office. They are supposed to be white, but they\u0027re filled with blue.\n\nAt 48 minutes into the movie, you see Donald Sutherland sitting in the grass with the character Molly. His suit is supposed to be black. Look at it. It\u0027s purple. That is not black.\n\nOn top of all that, the movie is too dark. There should have been a brightness/contrast adjustment. If you pay attention to dark areas in the movie, such as fixtures around a room or an office, most times, they are pitch black and indistinguished. For example, look at desk drawers, telephones, vases, black hair, black jackets..even Robert Duvall\u0027s eye patch. Not much shading, usually pitch black.\n\nI\u0027ve read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the North American release.\n\nI plan to get the Region 2 (Europe) release. I\u0027d rather do without watching it on my TV and watch it on my computer in better, \"proper\" quality.\n\n\u0027Nuff said\n",
    "\nWe were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.   They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash\n",
    "\nThis newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won\u0027t apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like \"pre-birth preparation,\" which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a \"ultimate baby care DVD.\"\n\nThe DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says \"over an hour of hints\"... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of \"you should always consult your doctor\" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.\n\nI\u0027ve seen this DVD and the \"ABC of Newborn Baby Care\" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it\u0027s better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.\n\nBTW, you can likely find this at your local library.  It\u0027s also available from Netflix.  It\u0027s just not worth the price of the DVD, not even 1/10 of the price\n",
    "\nOur daughter has weak muscles and I wanted some workout videos we could do as a family to supplement her physical therapy.

    "\n    When I was looking for a fitness DVD for me and my two oldest children (girls, ages 3 1/2 and 2) to do together, I was impressed with the reviews of this DVD and it sounded intriguing.  Though I wasn\u0027t really willing to shell out 16 bucks quite yet, so we rented it from Netflixs to try it out first.  \n\n    As adults my husband and I were really turned off by the \"animated\" bear, though our girls liked him.  Another thing that I wasn\u0027t really impressed with was the camera was at times only focusing on Kristi Dear\u0027s face or the animated bear and it was hard for me and our girls to follow exactly what moves she was doing when.  We had to run through the DVD a second time to really get the routine.  The total time of the DVD is 30 minutes, but only about 20-22 minutes of that is actual warm-up or workout time.  The rest is filler about why we need to exercise and eat healthy foods and snacks, which is fine to watch for the first time or two, but then I found myself fast forwarding through it to get to the workout sections.  Which if I had to do that every single time I watched it with my girls, I would get annoyed really fast.  My husband really did not think it was worth 16 dollars, he\u0027d be willing to spend maybe 5-7 dollars on it, but no more.\n\n    I gave the DVD 2 stars because Kristi Dear really does a good job of communicating with kids, has a pleasant voice, and demonstrates easy moves and routines for kids to do.  I highly recommend that you rent this first to see what you really think about it.\n",
    "\nThe Hidden Fortress is classic Kurosawa, in every way--except for the wild overacting, inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film.  Had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued, or given comic material with more edge, skewering the upper classes as well as themselves, or been less in the focus and operated far in the background, this wouldn\u0027t have been a problem.  But instead we\u0027re offered a sort of Dumb \u0026 Dumber, Beavis \u0026 Butthead of Japan, 50 years ago.  (And yes, I know that is anachronistic, but it\u0027s all too true.)  \"Stupidity is funny\" wears thin after a short while, and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast.  Oh, here comes a rocky upwards incline: let\u0027s watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up, etc.\n\nWhich is all too bad, because while the rest of the film has its overblown heroics, its far from bad.  The interactions between cast members has both tension and grit, while the outdoor settings mark a difference from the usual run of Japanese period films (though Kurosawa addicts like myself will well recall what he could do in Roshomon).  Mifune is over the top but splendid, and the direction has energy and focus.\n\nI\u0027ve seen this film twice in 25 years; most recently, just last night, again.  Unfortunately, my initial impressions were only confirmed--and I wish they weren\u0027t\n",
    "\nIt is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by Roger Moore\u0027 performance. Her\u0027s good for a dandy, in the continent, but in this film he is not convincing at all. He is verry debonnaire, like he is just sipping tea in Great Britain.Thus, the film becomes stiff and you don\u0027t believe it. The other actors simply try to do something, like a farce. It is a pity to see the great Richard Burton in such role.\nEugenia Lizald\n",
    "\nas usual, michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours. theres alot of great stuff here (the interview w marilyn manson, the interview w trey parker, \u0026c), but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling, no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston. i agree with many, nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution.\n",

Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.\n\nThere is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it\u0027s too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.\n\nThe writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story\u0027s protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.\n\nThe first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.\n\nIf you have any fond memories of the first one, avoid this turd\n",
    "\nNick Lachey and Jessica Simpson have a few good moments in the Nick and Jessica Variety Hour. But the show looks too \u002770s in its premise, too Donny and Marie-ish in some parts and Sonny and Cher-in some others.  Lachey\u0027s performance with Babyface is nice. How come Babyface didn\u0027t produce Nick\u0027s entire solo album instead of the batch of people Nick went to that caused Soul-O to flop?  He would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to. But having Mr. T and Johnny Bench and Kenny Rogers makes the show look, sadly, too 1983-ish. How come they couldn\u0027t get somebody current to perform on it, say Maroon 5 or Kanye West, who were both hot last April? They wanted to bring back the variety show format, but it\u0027s very hard to do it in an Internet age.  And Jessica isn\u0027t all that good on this show. I\u0027d rather hear her music and albums instead. They need to bring new things to the format if they\u0027re going to make another show. For now, Lachey and Simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this!\n",

    "\nIt is obvious the makers of this film were trying to create some kind of action-comedy hybrid, however it just doesn\u0027t work. The action scenes seem tacked-on and the gags just don\u0027t work. \n",
    "\nInstructions: rent Steven Seagall\u0027s latest action movie knuckle-fest \"Exit Wounds\". Insert in DVD player; watch first 15 minutes of movie, remove from DVD player. Return to video store. \n\n\nIf you follow those instructions to the letter, you\u0027ll have fun with \"Exit Wounds\", which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory (Seagall attempts to thwart a brash, brazen assassination attempt). \n\nThere\u0027s also a great scene---strike that, a Priceless Scene: hipster uber-villain (played convincingly by rapper DMX) and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot (ultimately settling on a Lamborghini Murcielago, paid for in cash out of a golf bag).\n\nThe scene is dope, def, and cool---it\u0027s all GOOD, Dawgz!----,in a New Jack City way. And that\u0027s a shame, really: it\u0027s so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin, over the course of two hours, to realize that the rest of the movie just can\u0027t hold a candle to its opening minutes. \n\nAn action movie should be exciting; after Seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the U.S. Vice President (a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own, and from which 95% of the trailer material was taken), \"Exit Wounds\" is not exciting. \n\nIt\u0027s stale. It\u0027s rehashed. Honestly, were it not for DMX, the few riffs from the movie\u0027s excellent rap soundtrack, and the equipment, I would have thought I was watching an eighties Seagall flick. And that\u0027s surprising, given that the movie is helmed by \"Romeo Must Die\" director Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also did the cinematography for Speed, Lethal Weapon 4, and Devil\u0027s Advocate. \n\nThe plot, what there is of it, deals with police corruption, and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and doesn\u0027t make any sense---but by that time you\u0027ve stopped caring. You\u0027ve seen all of this before---done better.\n\nWorst of all, Seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero; he\u0027s reached that wheezing, shortness of breath stage that afflicted Roger Moore back in \"View to a Kill\"---except Seagall doesn\u0027t have the acting chops that Moore was able to fall back on. Tom Arnold is thrown in for laughs, but the laughs are so feeble, and the jokes so stale, that you\u0027re laughing *at* Arnold and Seagall---not with them. \n\nMidway through \"Exit Wounds\" I was fighting to stay awake, and that\u0027s a shame, given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer, hectic energy than any movie I\u0027ve seen since \"Face/Off\". \n\nRent the DVD for that opener if you dare, but if you stay any longer you\u0027ll see it\u0027s true: Old Action Heroes never die, they just fade away.\n\nJS\n",

    "\nGood grief - yet another DVD collection we are not buying because Disney doesn\u0027t seem to understand.  We LOVED these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete.  I hope the folks at Disney get the message eventually.  Same thing applies to their live action feature films.  Disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother.  Too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production\n",

The singing is not bad (this cast has better technical control of their voices compared to the cast in Les Miz) but the choreography is trite and unimaginative, and the acting so juvenille that you\u0027d think the characters are retarded.  When the narrator fired his gun and a \"bang\" flag shot out from the gun instead -- that was over the top for me....  Yuck. \n",

    "\nAs I write this review, it was 5 years ago this very day that the Walt Disney Co. released the classic \"Fantasia\" for the first time on DVD as a 60th Anniversary Special Edition.  But exactly 5 years later, you can no longer purchase a legitimate, new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price, via such avenues as ebay.\n\nAs a Disney shareholder, I am one unhappy camper!!\n\nThis is the only reason I\u0027m rating this classic 5-star film with only 2 stars.  The DVD is no longer legitimately available without forking over at least $40 or $50 for a new copy when the original list price was well under $30 (and that current price is only going to go up as times passes by).  I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only consumer that\u0027s really sick and tired of Disney\u0027s inane policy of releasing and then quickly yanking some of their DVD releases.\n\nSo what am I supposed to do now?  Wait another 5 to 10 years just to buy a legitimate copy of this DVD when Disney finally decides that the time is right to release it again?  I think not!  I can\u0027t wait that long, and my nieces and nephews will probably be too old to care at that point.  Or, should I instead pay an insane price now for an original copy (the profits of which WILL NOT go to Disney)?  Again, I don\u0027t think so!  I do not believe in getting ripped off, and refuse to support those that profit from it, regardless of supply/demand fundamentals.\n\nIf Disney insists on continuing their ridiculous and outdated practice of discontinuing some of their classic films on DVD after only 2 to 3 years of availability, it shouldn\u0027t surprise them at all that they\u0027re actually LOSING POTENTIAL SALES to counterfeit/pirated versions of the films that are being sold around the world (and from auction sites like ebay, too).  The way I see it, THEY ASKED FOR IT!!  By not making these classics legitimately available at all times, they are encouraging piracy.  It\u0027s that simple, and they deserve it!!  In this day and age, people are not going to wait a few years to get something they want NOW!!\n\nI guess Disney is forcing me to think about buying a phony yet much cheaper DVD version of the original \"Fantasia\" just so I can show this classic to my nieces and nephews.  I\u0027d much rather buy a legitimate copy that\u0027s reasonably priced, but I can\u0027t because Disney won\u0027t allow me to do so.  Oh well, it\u0027s their loss.  A classic film like \"Fantasia\", which came in at No. 58 on the American Film Institute\u0027s 1998 list of the 100 greatest American movies of all time, deserves a far better fate than this. \n\nGreat job Disney!!  Way to go!\n",

    "\nRobert Wiene\u0027s \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" is a celebrated work of German Expressionism.  While there are several interesting facets to it, this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success.\n\nFrancis (Friedrich Feher) relays a strange story.  A man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival.  The exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  Strange happenings then ensued after Cesare predicted the death of one of Francis\u0027s friends.  Concerned for the safety of his beloved Jane (Lil Dagover), Francis took it upon himself to determine whether Caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events.\n\nIn a strange way, one can look upon \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" as a bizarre version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939).  The framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity.  Yet, despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation, \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" is stiff and dreary.  The characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in.  Give \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed, but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar.  \n",

As much as Billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated, about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were, and of course my kids at home, and I\u0027m sure any other kid picked up on this, and soon lost interest.\nSeveral things made this program boring:\nOne, you can\u0027t understand a thing Billy is saying, he would mumble unclear phrases thoughout the entire program, and his demeanor was very un-natural, to the point of being fake. He just looked \u0026 sounded very out of place working with kids. It came across like he \u0026 his crew weren\u0027t really sure how to interact with the kids, making them appear to be very fake. Another boring point was the movements, there was absolutely NO creativity here, these were some of the EXACT same movements from the adult Tae-Bo videos. Now, I do applaud Billy for slowing the movements down (unlike the adult Tae-Bo which goes at a break neck pace), these movements are performed in a controlled manner. But, they are still adult type movements, and extremely boring for kids. I would have liked to have seen some creativity with these movements to make them more kid friendly, and more EXCITING!\nTo be honest my kids were turned off \u0026 bored with this program after the first 10 minutes. Something Billy needs to realize is, kids are smarter than people give them credit for being. - They can tell when someone is being fake \u0026 not truly having fun, and they also realize that when kids on T.V. are bored \u0026 not having fun, then this isn\u0027t something they want to do.

    "\nI bought this DVD hoping that it will be a good one but it turned out to be awful and trashy. There is no story or plot to it, so I ended up throwing it away. I really regret buying it. \nIf you\u0027re into sex, then this film is for you but let me tell you this, it is boring like hell.\n",
    "\nEach scene is one shot, and that shot goes on and on and on, sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action.  This film is pretension personified, but that\u0027s okay.  Many people can\u0027t tell the difference between pretension and art.  The music too is full of squeaks and squawks.  In case you didn\u0027t know, that means that the music too is high art.  \n\nThere is no story.  Boy and girl see each other, and without preliminaries hit the sack.  We see boy \u0026 girl here, there, in the sack, here, there, in the sack, etc.  Occasionally we get a shot of some of the other characters.  \n\nBecause of the lack of dynamics, the film is not effective, either as drama or as eroticism.  Ironically, \"The Summer of \u002742\" was much more erotic even without any nudity (which would have helped).  \n\nThe vaulted sex scenes are three in number, chest and shoulders, and they last about three minutes each.  The much-touted fellatio scene is actually surprisingly good, more convincing than the \"love\" scenes.  \n\nThere are also a few brief full-frontal scenes of the star, who has a gorgeous body (hence, the two star rating).  \n\nBottom line: the only reason to see this movie is the nudity and the sex.  But there are many better movies for that.  So, only if you need the pretentiousness in order to permit yourself to see a sex movie should you see this.  \n",
    "\n*Warning: Spoiler*\nI cannot believe people, excuse me, some women are giving this movie four and five stars. \nInteresting premise,and it could have been a good, believeable movie-- but it was sooo syrupy. If this is what it\u0027s like to be in love, please somebody shoot me(note: I\u0027ve been in real love for 27 years now.) I got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end. Why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a \"good movie\"?\nI felt like I was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over. Wouldn\u0027t it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out? That, at least, would have made the movie more intriquing, believeable and redeeming. If ever a movie was made to force tears, this is it. \nThis movie stinks and I don\u0027t mind telling you so--and it\u0027s not just because I\u0027m a man either. Imo, there\u0027s not much difference between this movie and a stupid, blatant Steven Segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it\u0027s the elixir of heaven. Same coin, different sides.\n  The movie should be given a \"one\"--no a \"negative one\" just for the stupid ending, but other redeeming factors make it a \"two.\" Still not worth seeing--i.e., unless you\u0027re into infuriating yourself.\n\n**  Note: Even my wife and daughter--both chick-flick connousiours--hate this movie.I haven\u0027t checked yet, but I think my dogs do too.**\n\n  Another note: These two good actors needed a better movie. See Ryan in the superb \"Courage Under Fire\", or the Jim Morrison movie, or \"When Harry Met Sally\"--which I don\u0027t categorize as a \"chick flick\" but as a good romantic comedy,i.e., not contrived\n",
    "\nGeez, maybe I have a heart of stone. I wasn\u0027t a bit moved by the overrated Streep and handsome Clint. It\u0027s a story about two hearts linked as one - a sacrifice by a beautiful woman for the greater good - a touching story of common adultery committed by two randy, bored adults. Yawwwwn. Streep can do any accent on the planet, and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than Marcel Marceau. That doesn\u0027t make her an actress - just a clever chameleon. I\u0027d rather watch Julia Roberts play herself over and over and over than see Streep play \"pretend\" roles. There, I\u0027ve said it. Now goodnight.\n",
    "\nAlmost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of \u0027Shaft,\u0027 which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you\u0027d be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.   \n",
    "\n\"Legal Eagles\" is supposed to be a comedy. We\u0027re supposed to find the characters played by Robert Redford and Debra Winger to be amusing, their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious, and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying.\n\nThe problem is that the movie is too dumb to be taken seriously, and thus too dumb to be funny.\n\nBriefly, the story takes place in New York. Robert Redford is an assistant District Attorney about to be promoted to be the DA. Debra Winger is a defense attorney, and Daryl Hannah is a young woman with emotional problems, and is Debra Winger\u0027s client. The plot involves a fire 20 years ago, when Daryl Hannah was eight, a fire that killed her artist father and purportedly destroyed a large number of his paintings. This experience left Daryl Hannah traumatized, but all is not as it seems, and now, 20 years later, Daryl Hannah is first accused of attempted theft and later of murder.\n\nUnfortunately, the plot involves many elements that simply don\u0027t make sense. I won\u0027t go into detail, but Roger Ebert does a good job of listing four different major things that make the plot completely unbelievable.\n\nAs well as the story being dumb I found some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny to be anything but. \n\nFor example, Robert Redford is a weekend father to a teenage daughter. At one point his ex-wife threatens to go to court to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Robert Redford makes a telephone call to his ex-wife\u0027s home and starts an angry monologue of threats about how he\u0027ll take her apart in court. Then he realizes that he\u0027s actually talking to his daughter! This mistake is apparently supposed to be hilarious. Ha, ha.\n\nIn another scene Robert Redford and Debra Winger are together and see one of the bad guys. Robert Redford takes off on foot to try to catch him. Debra Winger, who doesn\u0027t know how to drive a car, feels it necessary for her to jump into Robert Redford\u0027s car and try to follow him. She makes a wrong turn and finds herself going the wrong way into traffic on a wide heavily trafficked street. There follows one minute of her frantically dodging cars at the last moment. Very funny. Ha, ha, ha.\n\nThis movie could have been a fairly good romantic thriller if they had fixed the plot and not tried to be a comedy. But the dumb plot and the unfunny attempts at comedy make it a complete waste of time.\n\nRennie Peterse\n",

    "\nSo-so movie. It has it\u0027s good parts along with some boring parts but overall, good special effects with the ghosts. There were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch. When a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew, he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of............. many ghosts. Just a OK movie.\n",
    "\nThirteen Ghosts is about a machine. This machine was designed by a Man who was at the time possessed my Satan. Yes, Satan. If the plot doesn\u0027t seem stupid enough, it needs Ghosts to power it. Ghostbusters anyone? At the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a Michael J Fox movie.  As time progresses you find out that the \u0027demonic machine\u0027 needs to be powered by ghosts. If done right, it opens the \u0027Eye to Hell\u0027. \nSave yourself a few bucks and don\u0027t rent this.  It\u0027s awfu\n",
    "\nI generally like some of these French-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they\u0027re usually pretty erotic.  Jane Fonda\u0027s role in Barbarella comes to mind.  This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend.\n\nBut the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn\u0027t force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It\u0027s not a good adventure film, and it\u0027s certainly not erotic.\n\nThere\u0027s a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust.   \n",
    "\nHarold Ramis\u0027s \"The Ice Harvest\" wallows in mid-market crime and holiday angst, but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires.  All the ingredients are there, but ultimately the movie lacks spice.  In some movies, it works where all the characters move at a slow pace - \"Nobody\u0027s Fool,\" for example.  But a dark comedy needs some pep, and \"The Ice Harvest\" doesn\u0027t have it.\n\nA lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors.  He is at his best when he is riffing one of his intelligent-yet-soulful monologues, like in \"High Fidelity\" and \"Say Anything.\"  Here, Cusack\u0027s job is to look morose and make the occasional comment - he may speak the fewest lines in any film he\u0027s made as a leading man, and that\u0027s a shame.  Billy Bob Thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes, but the menacing actor is off-screen for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt.  The same with the entertaining Oliver Platt, who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone - he\u0027s enjoyable on-screen, but when he\u0027s not there, we miss him.\n\nThe bar is set pretty high for holiday-as-setting-for-dysfunction movies. None of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the husband-wife spat of \"The Ref,\" for example.  The movie is filled with small-time hoods who all seem hung-over or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits.  Instead, we get an ominous film that in many ways tries to evoke \"Fargo\" or \"A Simple Plan,\" but doesn\u0027t get anywhere close.  \n\nThere are a few laugh-out-loud moments that I won\u0027t spoil that keep the movie from being a complete waste of time.  But all in all, the movie is a downer, and when the winners are finally revealed at the end, it feels less like a triumph than it does a ho-hum conclusion.  \n\nThroughout the movie, I kept wondering if this would have been a much more enjoyable movie where we got to see what was actually going on inside the minds of the characters . . . there seemed to be many scenes where the actors kept the best lines to themselves.  Petty crime can be highly enjoyable, but not in \"The Ice Harvest.\" \n",
    "\nLong, tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog, bad plot holes, and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from Bad Boys.  \n\nMarcus and Mike are out about, trying to find some ecstasy they\u0027ve been alerted about.  They get into a bunch of fights, a bunch of car chases, they get in trouble, they argue with each other.  Then they go and they get into another fight, then they get in trouble, only this time they argue with each other first.  Then they argue with each other, then get into a fight, then get in trouble.  Then they get into trouble, argue with each other, and get into a fight.  The fights?  The same thing, over and over again.  Marcus is upset because he feels his life is in danger.  Mike is upset because he feels Marcus is bringing in negative energy.  They parody relationship therapy.\n\nThere\u0027s another thing happening.  It\u0027s this Cuban antagonist.  We don\u0027t really care about him, really.  He just kind of runs around, being Cuban and evil and all.  Then we get to see him get angry at people.  Then he becomes devious.  Then he becomes malicious and angry again.\n\nSo we watch, for over two hours, with just enough action to keep it moving.  Action that involves a certain camera movement, then a reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot...  The only truly interesting action scene occurred in that house with the Rastafarians, with that spinning camera thing.  That was pretty clever.  That\u0027s why this film got any stars at all from me.\n\nReally, all I got from this film was the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make the Bad Boys series, if there will ever be one (probably...) into the Lethal Weapon series.  I also got a lot of stuff about terrible psychoanalysis which was, to me, Michael Bay telling the world that male attraction to action adventure movies is not some weird psychoanalitical crazy mess, but just good natured fun.  Which is why the movie got a bit more of a higher rating from me.\n\nOtherwise, wow, was that tedious.\n\n--PolarisDi\n",
    "\nAfter 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I\u0027ve come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it\u0027s incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don\u0027t need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more \u0027epic fly-by shots please.\n",
    "\nEraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention, but overall the movie displayed poor acting, stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot.

    "\nThis movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it\u0027s the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton\u0027s other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you\u0027re an adult and pales compared to the original. If you\u0027re a kid it\u0027s way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking \"Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?\" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It\u0027s really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It\u0027s amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don\u0027t waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!\n",

    "\nGeorge Sluizer\u0027s original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema\u0027s most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you\u0027ve seen that version, you probably still can\u0027t get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its \u0027Lady Vanishes\u0027 plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.\n\nChief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying \"Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.\u0027 \n\nBut the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don\u0027t even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they\u0027re given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple\u0027s relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he\u0027s probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let\u0027s end on a joke like a TV cop show\u0027 moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can\u0027t do anything for this one. \n",
    "\nJoel Hershman\u0027s \"Greenfingers\", starring the now-famous (and utterly gorgeous) Clive Owen and Helen Mirren, is a sweet, cutesy, and utterly empty British romantic comedy.  In this forgettable, generic chick-flick, inmates at a British minimum-security prison take up gardening.  Initially, they are understandably reluctant to garden.  But, get this, gardening ends up changing their lives!  And, after his parole, Owen\u0027s character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden!  And Mirren\u0027s character is so impressed with the innmates\u0027 gardening that she even has them garden for her!  Wow, where do people get this stuff?\n\nOf course, this being a \"romantic comedy\" and all, there is a romance between Owen and Mirren\u0027s daughter that is so incredibly forced, awkward, and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other.  In addition, peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed \"uplifting moments\".  And none of it works.\n\nFor all its good intentions, \"Greenfingers\" is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates\u0027 rooms. It\u0027s all perfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull\n",
    "\nThe flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer\u0027s Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.  I quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf Astoria downtown.\n\n\"I have to admit that I didn\u0027t you who you were until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS.  I don\u0027t mean to embarrass you; but that book changed my life.\"\n\nI tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment.  For the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile.  I very much approved of her legs.\n\nAs I departed the car, Kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes.\n\n\"Don\u0027t forget.  I\u0027ll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together.  Please be ready.\"\n\nI expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp.  The hotel staff greeted me and soon I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor.  As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours.\n\nFinally, a bit of peace.  I poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below.  For a few moments I contemplated the remarks I was to make at this evening\u0027s formal ceremonies, then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room.  \n\nI turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit.\n\n\"Well, Crabby, aren\u0027t you glad to see me?\"\n\nBefore I could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right.  It was Jennifer Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit.\n\n\"Sweetheart, don\u0027t look at her.  Come here to me.\"\n\n\"Get out!\" screamed Sandy.  \n\n\"No, you get out.  It\u0027s not fair.  I left Brad for him so I get him!\"\n\nThe two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment.  Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other.  It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain, and nylon tearing could be heard.  Then almost a quickly as it began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor.  \n\nSandy marched back into the room victorious.  I ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked.  Before I could think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder.  I turned around and there Sandy stood.  A little worse for wear.  Trying to catch her breath.  Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet.\n\n\"Forget her.  She won\u0027t bother us now.\"\n\nSandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume.  She posed standing and anticipating my admiration.  \n\n\"Now I\u0027m all sweaty and warm.  I need a shower.\"  Sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond.\n\nI turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor.  Then I heard Sandy calling.\n\n\"Crabby, why don\u0027t you come and help me?  You could soap up my......\"\n\n\nOOPS!!!!  Sorry!!!  Err...just a little fantasy of mine.  I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over.  I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here.  You see, the cover of this DVD displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font letters.  But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love interest.\n\nAs much as I \"love\" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her.  Her best films have been WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS.  Unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON, HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie.\n\nThe plot revolves around two \"losers in love\" who are unappealing both in looks and personality.  Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet.  All goes well until others find out their secret and Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other.\n\nThe story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet.  Chances are you can find a copy of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you\u0027re waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you can really do something worth wild.\n",
    "\nSomeone bought this 3D DVD for my almost 5 year old daughter.  We thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were.  However,  within minutes of the movie\u0027s beginning my daughter was in tears. I won\u0027t say why but she found the plot frightening.  Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end.  Fortunately the movie is relatively short.  Overall, I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas.  As an adult, I think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of Christmas shopping but I urge caution before showing it to young children.  There was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of Christmas\n",

    "\nIt is unusual that I disagree with so many great critics praising a movie where there is so much talent. This movie tries to deal with alot and does alot of it well BUT as a viewer, I am hugely distracted by Mamet\u0027s dialogue. No, I do not agree that people in the real business world talk like this! Real people do not mindlessly echo over and over and over the same phrases that they hear each other speaking. If I did that in my working environment my coworkers would think there was something wrong with me. Real conversation does not run in that kind of patter. After listening to the characters for ninety minutes, I finally came to the conclusion that many of the characters sounded alike and the one connection point was Mamet. Real people talk differently from each other. They use different and distinct speech patterns and phrases and slang. I\u0027ve had this problem with Mamet before and I can\u0027t believe nobody has ever noticed this before - and I would doubt that I am the first. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if - somewhere - some actor in some Mamet production has pondered this before. Come on! Good dialogue is like good acting: if it\u0027s really good, you don\u0027t notice it until the show\u0027s over.\n",
    "\nWhat a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn\u0027t understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage\u0027s character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.

A few sequences look properly spectacular, but after watching this DVD on two separate (and high-quality) televisions, I\u0027m amazed that all of the low-light scenes have been rendered almost completely dark. Like, too dark to tell what\u0027s even *happening*. For instance, the scene where Brad (Harry Carey, Jr.) runs off to his death, the scene where Marty\u0027s (Jeffrey Hunter\u0027s) \"bride\" is serving coffee along the river, and even the pre-dawn scenes leading up to the final storming of the Comanche camp, are utterly lost in the dark. By contrast, the bare-bones 1997 DVD release features noticeably richer colors in the daytime scenes and total clarity in the low-light scenes I\u0027ve just mentioned. Don\u0027t waste your money on this special edition; you\u0027ll be much happier if you just shell out the $10.99 for the 1997 release.\n",

    "\nDon\u0027t expect a comedy in the vein of TRINITY or THEY CALL ME TRINITY. If you do, you are in for a fall. Both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining. This one has no such pretensions. It is merely boring.\n\nThe story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town\u0027s folk out of their claims. They do this through intimidation and violence. When a couple of friends get hold of a claim, they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys. To do this, they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction. They yell, they fight, they wrestle, they shoot and then they do it some more. Its not very exciting cinema.\n\nThis production is made worse by the DVD. I suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair. The DVD, however, is of such low quality that who could really tell? The edges are clipped off, the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it. IT was not worth the effort.\n\nSpaghetti westerns can be fun. This one, however, needs the Pepto Bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn.\n",

    "\nThis is the worst Asian movie that I have ever seen.  The story is dumb and doesn\u0027t make any sense, especially the ending.  And to top it off it isn\u0027t that scary - it only gets a little bit scary at the end.\n\nMy recommendation:  Don\u0027t get this movie.  It is also too expensive.  It you want to watch a good Asian horror movie, I have lots of recommendations.  Wishing Stairs is pretty good.  Koma is an excellent movie. A Tale of Two Sisters is pretty good. Good luck\n",
    "\nIf this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can\u0027t be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. There just wasn\u0027t time enough, I guess, to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you\u0027ve read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book\n",

    "\nWell, This dvd is pretty bad, like everyone else said. It\u0027s 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background. I believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren\u0027t getting high ratings on the anime series. Anyway, I didn\u0027t buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf\u0027s rain fan. But, don\u0027t be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window. I really highly recommend renting this before you buy it, cause otherwise you are wasting your money\n",
    "\nWhat really bothered me about Hudsucker Proxy: Capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone, even Communist slaves and Fascist toady\u0027s under a democratic people; yet, Hollywood insists on blasting Corporate Culture, when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest, they are exemplary. \n\nSo much Hollywood talent and money wasted on a bad idea, so what else is new?  The Coen\u0027s have jumped the shark with this take off of the American Screwball Comedy of the 30\u0027s.  I cringed every time Jennifer Jason Leigh tried to imitate Katharine Hepburn\u0027s classic gargle.  The poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker. \n\nI can\u0027t stand Tim Robbin\u0027s politics, but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies.  He almost carries this farce.  Paul Newman; however, is collecting a check.  He\u0027s been collecting checks since the 50\u0027s.  His salad dressing stinks too.\n\nI\u0027m amazed at how much money the Coen\u0027s command in Hollywood on such flimsy pitches.

Then, a loud part comes on and almost blows my speakers.  This happens multiple times per episode.  Repeat this for six hours.  If I wanted this kind of quality, I\u0027d just download the episodes off the Internet.  There will be a gap in my collection until this is fixed.

    "\nTrying to make a film concerning Studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea. It\u0027s just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era. Gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on. From what I understand, the original director\u0027s cut was gutted by Miramax before the film was released it and it shows. Other than Mike Meyers portrayal of Steve Rubell, there\u0027s hardly a gay character in sight. There\u0027s some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted. Thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel. Anyone with a taste for fine filmmaking need not bother with this cinematic mistake\n",
    "\nI guess when any era becomes old enough for the \"Nostaglia Craze\" to hit, we get to see what exagerations get stretched to the point of lying. Case in point the 1950\u0027s were NOT such an innocent age, and the 1970\u0027s were NOT that wild.\n\nStudio 54, and the Disco Era in general were about Freedom, Great Music, Great People Watching, and in general having a hell of a goodtime. For the brief period that it ruled the music charts, Disco broke down barriers, and the stars of certain musical genres were able to crossover. I often call 1979 \"the year that music got close to the light\".\n\nMy BIG issue with this movie is that It FAILED to show that for many of us we took advantage of the liberation of Disco\u0027s (like 54), and ENJOYED ourselves. It was glamorous, it was over the top, and IT WAS FUN. Amazing as it seems, many of us did not inhail cocaine like air, and for some of us who did indulge, we did not become adicts, or for that matter guilt ladden.\n\nClubs like Studio 54 were great palaces that broke down many barriers, and helped us escape the many issues facing the nation in the late 70\u0027s.\n\nToo bad this movie did not convey it.\n\n   \n",

    "\nI\u0027m of the opinion that King\u0027s books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King\u0027s work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.\n\nA novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer\u0027s ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?\n\nI won\u0027t bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you\u0027ll have already guessed it by the time you\u0027re half way through. It\u0027s all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish.\n\nI will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King\u0027s fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile. \n\nMaybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn\u0027t mean that we have to watch them\n",
    "\nFilming the story of Gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio, from Warner Brothers to BBC. The Virgin Queen still retains her power to enthrall, intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne. She was perhaps England\u0027s last true absolute monarch, and certainly one of its greatest, if not most famous. \n\nSince the advent of film, she has been one of the most coveted roles to play. Indeed, few monarchs have been so closely chronicled, save perhaps her own father, Henry VIII, and Victoria. \n\nShe has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses: Sarah Bernhardt, Bette Davis, Judi Dench, Judith Anderson, Miranda Richardson, Flora Robson, Cate Blanchett, Helen Mirren, even Quentin Crisp, and most famously, and importantly, Glenda Jackson. \n\nAnd it must be said without doubt that Glenda Jackson\u0027s \"Elizabeth R\" is the defining portrait-- the most accomplished, historically accurate, and masterfully acted. Glenda Jackson is Elizabeth I reincarnate; there is simply none better, and likely never will be.\n\nSo now we have Anne-Marie Duff in the red wig for 230 Masterpiece Theatre minutes. Perhaps for the sake of revisionists, we are offered a far less imperious monarch, one who is both reactive (the real one was) and passive (the real one was not). Duff is an odd choice. No beauty like Cate Blanchett, but Elizabeth was known for vanity, not beauty. Duff\u0027s Elizabeth, with quivering lip and watercolor behavior, seems filmed underwater, and make for an undesirable monarch-- certainly not the Gloriana of myth or fact. Where is her famous wit, her coy manipulations, her strong moral fiber, her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers? Left with Glenda Jackson, I suppose. This Elizabeth is a simpering, love-struck maiden or a crass, 60-something hag (and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance). Hag works; crass manages; simpering loses the whole impact.\n\nA suavely elegant, very attractive and distinctly healthy Queen Mary I opens Elizabeth\u0027s story (no Catharine Parr, no Thomas Seymour, no childhood) but is quickly dispatched. Just as well, for she\u0027s thoroughly ill-cast--Mary was none of those things. (Far better was the wonderful Kathy Burke in the Blanchett version, though she was a bit of a Protestant caricature). Daphne Slater in the Jackson series was far more appealing, and perfectly written. \n\nElizabeth\u0027s transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life. No part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years-- the abuse by Seymour, imprisonment, exile, and finally her accession. Unfortunately, much of this key period is sped through. The fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast Elizabeth mooning incessantly over Robert Dudley, later Earl of Leicester, here played by a childish, petulant Tom Hardy. There is no chemistry here; he is pretty, but vacant. Glenda Jackson\u0027s Dudley, Robert Hardy (no relation that I know of), is a bit of a fop, but he knows his place in court and Elizabeth\u0027s heart. Their chemistry is clear. This version of Dudley is a bit ridiculous-- how he would claim the Queen\u0027s heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance. So is most of the casting (what\u0027s with the acrobat?)\n\nAn egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by Dudley\u0027s long-suffering wife Amy Robsart, whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery. More time should have been spent on the wooing of Elizabeth by the French Duc d\u0027Alencon, who very nearly came to be her husband (again, the 1971 Glenda Jackson version handles this segment masterfully).\n\nAll too soon and without sufficient explanation, we become immersed in the historically key, decades-long battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous Mary, Queen of Scots-- Elizabeth\u0027s 2nd cousin, granddaughter of Henry VIII\u0027s older sister Margaret, whose claim to the English throne made her a rallying point of Catholics, and a very real threat to Elizabeth (it was Mary\u0027s son James who succeeded Elizabeth in 1603, founding the ill-fated House of Stuart). \n\nFar more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, which was Elizabeth\u0027s darkest hour-- forever bloodying her saintly propaganda. Likewise, more attention should have been given to Walshingham, Elizabeth\u0027s master of subversion, although William Cecil, Lord Burghley, is given fair due.\n\nThe decisive Armada happens much too quickly, lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of Elizabeth and Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, portrayed by Hans Matheson, who is cast and directed as a bad-tempered, bipolar \"Mama\u0027s Boy\" (a very strange Oedipal twist here) whose hair, look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585. The entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship, here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling. The casting is awful, the acting mediocre, the personality baffling. This Essex is a wreck-- blame the revisionist director.\n\nTwo significant annoyances: Elizabeth\u0027s (Duff\u0027s) accent isn\u0027t simply London middle-class, which would be fine, but stands in stark contrast to everyone else\u0027s appropriate English diction and clarity. She comes off as a guttersnipe. And worse of all-- distracting to the utmost-- is the incessant soundtrack that dominates--and not pleasantly-- the action and plot of the movie. The sheer volume of it is horrendous, to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with Essex\u0027s electric guitar.\n\nMy suggestion here is to rent this one, watch it as long as you can, and then return to Davis, Blanchett, Jackson, or even Dench. Overall, a disappointment. Were it not for 95% historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes-- plus the decent acting (most of the problems are the director\u0027s fault, don\u0027t blame the actors), it would have earned one star. But this Queen is no legend, and this cast is horrendous. An inglorious Gloriana.\n",
    "\nAs much as I like Paul Newman, this movie is very disappointing once you\u0027ve seen the far-superior film \"Day One\".  The portrayal of Oppenheimer and Groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people.

    "\n\nThere\u0027s a saying: \"No one sets out to make a bad movie.\"  BROTHERS GRIMM (Miramax) might prove otherwise.  Near the beginning of his commentary, the usually brilliant Terry Gilliam actually says, \"I didn\u0027t like the script, but I was out of work.\"  Not a good sign but an honest admission from the former Python.\n\nAlthough wonderfully visualized, the Czech locations can\u0027t make-up for the muddled mess of a screenplay culled from perhaps the richest mother lode of raw story material available anywhere: The collected fairy tales of Wilhem and Jacob Grimm.  \n\nIn spite of stars Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as con artist exorcists who encounter real evil, a great poster and an OK trailer, audiences rightfully stayed away via quick word of mouth (\"incomprehensible\" \"unwatchable\"). Worthy extras of interest mainly to budding filmmakers are Gilliam\u0027s commentary and the featurette: \"The Visual Magic of the Brothers Grimm.\n",
    "\nDon\u0027t waste your time. I usually give low budget horror a chance and I have an open mind, but this movie is utterly ridiculous. \n",
    "\nTo be fair, the legends of Herakles, as they were originally written, have little to do with this movie, but maybe that\u0027s for the best.  Having grown up on Superman, Batman and the Justice League, I have a hard time calling a person like Herakles a hero.  In the original legends, he was a warrior, but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage.  He also wasn\u0027t, as far as I can tell, as strong as in this version.\nTherefore, interpretations of Herakles are, I think, to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend, but on where and why.\nDisney has attempted to take Herakles (or Hercules, in the Roman) and make it a story about a true hero, and a perfect one at that.  There\u0027s nothing I like more than perfect heroes.  They inspire me.  Conceptually, I like the idea.\nInstead of Herakles being the illegitimate son of Zeus and a mortal woman, he\u0027s conceived in love by Zeus and Hera and turned mortal by a potion.  Not bad.  As changes go, it works better than most.\nHerc meets Meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him (another deviation from the legend, and a very good improvement.)  Of course, because Hera is his mother in this version, she can\u0027t be Herc\u0027s enemy, so they make his opponent Hades; lord of the dead, which could be worse, as changes go.  I\u0027ve never seen Hades as being all that bad of a guy, but that\u0027s how it goes.  Then there\u0027s the Hydra, which is, if anything, much larger and more powerful than it was originally, so that\u0027s good too.  Aside from this, however, I have to say I was disappointed with most of the changes.\nThe titans, to start with, were underplayed considerably.  It might have been premature to mention that they were Zeus\u0027 predecessors, but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had, and a roughly-similar appearance.  Oceanus, for example, lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose, or Cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence, particularly since Hercules didn\u0027t beat the titans alone in the original stories, nor does it make sense that he should in this one (grabbing a whirlwind?  Come ON now.)\nI actually didn\u0027t mind Hades\u0027 used-car-salesman demeanor all that much, though I didn\u0027t see a reason why he should have flame-based powers when that\u0027s clearly Apollo\u0027s territory.  Further, I thought most of the Gods and Muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature.\nWhy is this the case?  I think Disney made the mistake, in this film, of not just trying to make the legends clean, but FUN as well, and there\u0027s nothing fun about war.  I\u0027m not saying they couldn\u0027t have made the concept work.  In fact, I\u0027m saying they could have made it work if they\u0027d toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect (Justice League style.)\nStill, for what it\u0027s worth, this is one of the few movies left in the world that isn\u0027t afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero, and for that it\u0027s worth at least one viewing.  Rent it from your local video store, in my opinion, before you make your decision\n",

(really obvious in the salsa style section) It took a few times of doing to get all the moves right, but even after that it barely raises the heart rate.  The warm up leaves much to be desired. The cool down continues the \"dance\" movements but at a \"slower\" rate and stretching the neck for one second on each side and the inner thigh for one second here and those are not enough to even make you realize that you are stretching.

    "\nok, I\u0027ve only just seen this film for the first time, so it\u0027s hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.\n\nI mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson\u0027s in it. and if you\u0027re a fan of dave chapelle\u0027s tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.\n\nbut that\u0027s really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they\u0027re ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine\u0027s road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.\n\ntake the french film \u0027la haine\u0027, for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in \u0027la haine\u0027 is quite a bit better.\n\nso while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there\u0027s a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn\u0027t try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one\n",

    "\nFor months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It\u0027s unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don\u0027t own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don\u0027t understand why these movie companies can\u0027t be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world.\n\nUnfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a \"Special Edition\" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they\u0027ve advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement\n",

    "\nThe original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.

    "\nHonestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I\u0027m surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it. \n\nThe stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there\u0027s a V.I.P suspect with a \"history\" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he\u0027s involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it\u0027s not him. And Calleigh gets \"evidence\" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I\u0027ve seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge \"clues\" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that\u0027s unlikely? Exactly my point.\n\nIn short, I wouldn\u0027t move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you\u0027re REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas.

    "\nI\u0027m a fan of the 1999 \"The Mummy\" and was understandably looking forward to this sequel. In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.  \n\nIt\u0027s a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it\u0027s true, and \"The Mummy Returns\" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.  \n\n\"The Mummy Returns\" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. \"The Mummy Returns\" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS: \"The Mummy Returns\" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It\u0027s unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball. \n\nNeedless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. \"Returns\" put an end to that.  \n",
    "\nCharlize Theron, her real life boyfriend Stuart Townsend, and Penelope Cruz are all nice to look at, and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work, Theron having won as Osca for her role in Monster.\n\nBut Head In The Clouds is one of those beautifully filmed films starring a beautiful cast that trying to stay beautiful in an increasingly ugly world, particularly Europe in the 1930s. From the Spanish Civil War to World War II, the stories of these three people who share a Paris flat together is supposed to be a sweeping tragedy that shows how world events and fate can conspire to thwart true love.\n\nInstead, it shows how silly things can be when you mix hedonism, narcissism, social responsbility, and sheer stupidity. You end up caring less about the characters, andwondering more how much more trouble will they get themselves in. This was a pretty stylish waste of time for everyone involved\n",
    "\nOne of the worst movies i\u0027ve ever seen, no real plot and acting is as bad as it can get. Not even Samuel Jackson\u0027s appearance saves this sorry excuse for a movie. Horrible. Awful\n",
    "\nI could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern\u0027s classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp\u0027s \"performance\" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton\u0027s film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton\u0027s part, that doesn\u0027t make the final product any more watchable. It\u0027s one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton\u0027s other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that\u0027s like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$\n",
    "\nThis movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  As a huge Colin Firth fan originally from a small town in Vermont, I thought that no matter what I had heard about the film I would enjoy it.  Unfortunately,  I was wrong. \n     \nThe main problem of the film was characterization.  There were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character\u0027s actions.  One minute, the small town girl played by Heather Graham is working at a nursing home, then she\u0027s downing alcohol, then she\u0027s jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason (in fact, she doesn\u0027t even seem drunk), and all this entices the character Colin Firth to jump into bed with her.  I think the Heather Graham character is supposed to be quirky, but because of the script and the way the film is cut, she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable.  Then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which Colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance (and this is no rebound relationship).  Basically, the movie continues along this vein, with Minnie Driver showing up as the dark-haired British ex-fiance who you can\u0027t see ever having had a relationship with Colin (both actors are better in the much superior movie Circle of Friends).  In any case, there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups/get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends.\n    \nAdditionally, the setting is completely misused, beginning with the sign that says more than 18,000 people live in Hope.  In New England, that does not classify as a small town.  They could have used the autumn setting and American-ness of the people as restorative to the Colin character.  The suggestion of that is there, but it is never demonstrated - instead, they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the Heather Graham character downs a bottle of booze, and Colin Firth\u0027s character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town\u0027s people.  Although the hotel owners are fun, if unrealistic, the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character. \n    Finally, I don\u0027t neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie, with the wierd cutting, it may have seemed like a good idea at the time.  I think Colin Firth does his best at being an ambigious, but still likeable guy.  Heather Graham, aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all, has absolutely nothing to work with, so you can\u0027t even blame her for the horrendous character she has.  And everyone else, including Minnie Driver, is a complete caricature, although Minnie Driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film.\n    I feel bad to judge this movie so harshly, but it is unneccessarily bad, and I had been hoping for something at least fun.  These actors all have much better movies out there.\n",
    "\nHere\u0027s the \"Awful Truth\": \n\nThat you would be willing to let this man, a raving, terminally obese, incoherent highschool dropout, who is to truth what a lead block smeared with ketchup is to cheesecake---that you would let this man literally plunge his hamburger-grease stained mitts into your skull, forming the mushy stuff of your brain into little foamy pink chunks of liberal pabulum.\n\nAnd that you would pay him money to render the service!\n\nYes, you could watch all of the episodes in \"The Awful Truth\": you would, no doubt, feel smug and superior to all those unenlightened troglodytes who voted for Bush. You might giggle a bit, which is a common side-effect of a political lobotomy.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it is far better that you take your lead from antiquity: when Oedipus realized his own version of the \"Awful Truth\"---that he had whacked Pa, gotten jiggy with Ma, and generally made an a** of himself---he stabbed out his own eyeballs. \n\nMight I recommend the white-hot iron pokers?\n\nJS\n",
    "\nI preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it\u0027s a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you\u0027re reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don\u0027t write an essay!\n\nNow, on to my review of The Ghost and the Darkness on DVD.\n\nI remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn\u0027t until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it\u0027s fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I\u0027m a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they\u0027re fine here, but they\u0027ve definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too.\n\nNow the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I\u0027m not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio.\n\nVIDEO: C-\nAUDIO: A\nFILM:  B\n",
    "\nI did not much enjoy this film, and I didn\u0027t find it very clever or funny. \n\nIt\u0027s true, as other amazon reviewers have noted, that Citizen Ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue. Does that make it an intelligent and even-handed comic treatment of a complex topic? No, indeed.\n\nAlong the way, it also stereotypes poor people, middle class people, teenagers, drug addicts, Christians, and Vietnam veterans. That doesn\u0027t make it funny, though, because the satire is so heavy-handed and predictable. Simply tackling an important social topic, like abortion, isn\u0027t going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor. In my opinion, the film\u0027s pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy. There were too many close-ups of earnest, wide-pored, and angry faces. And Burt Reynolds as the national leader of the anti-abortion crowd was just peculiar. What was he doing in this film? And what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young Eric?\n\nLaura Dern is a talented actress, and she does a creditable job with this part -- which because it straddles genres was a challenging one. But her talent couldn\u0027t redeem this film for me\n",
    "\nI have never been a Demi Moore fan, but this movie is even worse than I imagined it would be. My kids picked it up in the videotheque. I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them. Demi\u0027s acting is rather passionless, poor and disconnected. She looks old too ! She doesn\u0027t succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That\u0027s what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don\u0027t care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn\u0027t know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere. I expected a film with supernatural elements, but boy did I get fooled. Some of the photography and scenery was acceptable, but the CGI generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly. Alas, not a film that I can recommend to anyone.      \n",
    "\nHalf Light (Craig Rosenberg, 2006)\n\nI\u0027ve been following some heated debate about this flick on movie boards, and it\u0027s brought a somewhat related (if tangentially) point into focus for me: why it is that movies like Darkness, the 2002 Spanish \"thriller\" with all the suspense of a Pee Wee Herman monologue, and Haute Tension, France\u0027s painfully bad 2005 attempt at horror, come over to America and fall flat. Well, I knew the answer, but really, you\u0027re all providing me with more evidence. You\u0027ve never seen a good horror film in your life, have you? Because that\u0027s really the only way I can see justifying Darkness, Haute Tension, or Half Light as marginal, much less good, movies.\n\nDemi Moore plays Rachel Carlson, an American author living in Scotland with her husband Brian (Henry Ian Cusick) and their son Thomas (the wonderfully-named Beans el-Balawi, recently in the TV adaptation of Beneath the Skin). Thomas suffers a household accident, which leads to Rachel and Brian splitting up. Rachel\u0027s friend Sharon (Coupling\u0027s Kate Isitt) finds Sharon a lovely, secluded place on the coast to hole up and try to write (and why is it that dead kids always lead to parents going off somewhere secluded, where they\u0027re bound to be tormented by guilt?). Rachel meets a number of fine locals, including Angus McCulloch (The Mists of Avalon\u0027s Hans Matheson), keeper of an even more secluded lighthouse not far from her new place, with whom she feels an instant attraction. Despite being free of the marriage bond, Rachel\u0027s not quite sure what to make of her handsome stranger...\n\n...and neither are we. There\u0027s obviously supposed to be chemistry between these two characters, but it\u0027s never realized. It\u0027s probably off looking for the film\u0027s suspense, which Rosenberg reminds us we\u0027re supposed to be feeling by inserting a few scenes that tread the ground of every suspense movie clich� in the entire book. Once you\u0027ve figured out the movie\u0027s big twists (yes, there\u0027s more than one, handled with all the delicacy afforded to, say, a road being repaved), which you will have done less than thirty minutes into the film, Rosenberg attempts to hit you with another big twist at the end. There\u0027s only one problem-- the movie\u0027s climactic scene is so befuddling that any attempt at inserting another plot twist that leads to the film\u0027s resolution does nothing but leave the viewer confused and unsatisfied. (Go look at the film boards in various places. There is one question that crops up over and over again. It relates to the utter inability of the climax to get its point across.)\n\nIt\u0027s not often that I say Darkness is better than another horror film. After all, Darkness was about the most pointless exercise in mediocrity possible. But if you have died and gone to Hell, and you have a choice of which of the two to watch on endless loop for the rest of eternity, Darkness should be a no-brainer. Yes, this one\u0027s that bad. \n",
    "\nI\u0027ve owned the LaserDisc version of \"New Order Story\" for 5 years and watch parts of it at least once a week, so I thought having the DVD version would be an upgrade.

I mainly bought it so I could have the full version of the promo for \"The Perfect Kiss\", -which in \"story\" is almost ruined by Bono\u0027s horrible voice- but it turns out it has a huge skip in the DVD version.

Either it was the actor\u0027s depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.  \n\nMaybe I\u0027m not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film. \n\nIn addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I\u0027m one myself, having made two movies)\n\nThe only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better\n",
    "\n  I\u0027m very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does, I suppose most are simply glad the show is available on DVD.  However, the transfer to DVD is absolutely horrible.  On an opening night shot on disc 1, there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs -- inside the house!  The colors on these prints aren\u0027t even as good as what is shown on TVLand.  This show might be 30 years old, but they cannot be using the best prints available.  There is another irritating tip-off of the cheapness of this package -- the music on the closing credits is wrong -- or is this my imagination?\n\n   For those who are defending this package, the upcoming Daniel Boone DVD set is a good item to compare it with.  That show aired in 1966 and the remastered print is fantastic.  Studios and re-issue companies can do a good job when they choose to.  It\u0027s a real shame that, in this age of big-screen TVs, this program will look so shoddy.  It\u0027s apparent that with such a popular show, they could have recouped the investment\n",
    "\nFirst let me say that I thought Angela\u0027s Ashes was an absolutely terrific book and Frank McCourt fully deserved his Pulitzer Prize. This movie was a horrendous let down. No one involved with the film seemed to have a clue about how to depict real deprivation and poverty. Everything was a Hollywood version of suffering and misery, from Emily Watson\u0027s pretty red coat standing in for the real Angela\u0027s gray rag to the beautifully lit Irish streets and of course John \"let me tell you how you\u0027re supposed to feel right now\" Williams\u0027 cloying, inappropriate music. \n\nThe acting from the children was great. They were absolutely the best part of the film. Of course, given the constraints of film and the average audience tolerance for unpleasantness such as oozing eyes, pimples and bad teeth all the kids were pleasing to look at, clear skinned and attractive. At least they could act! \n\nEmily Watson was given little to do. Robert Carlyle was good although Alan Parker seemed determined to sanitize the ambiguities of McCourt\u0027s father by only showing little episodes of drunkeness and thoughtlessness. \n\nParker tends to be an extremely literal, by-the-numbers director with little understanding of subtlety (look what he did in the Pink Floyd\u0027s \"The Wall\"). This time he  was clearly given a mandate by the Hollywood bigwig producers not to make the film too \"depressing\" or \"grim\" so that audiences would accept it. The film ends up being a choppy, gentrified, soulless version of one of the best modern books ever written.  Really a shame and a waste of resources.\n",

Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one\u0027s boring. \n",
    "\nI saw this movie yesterday thinking it\u0027d be exciting. I sure am glad that I survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie. There\u0027s no story line, the acting is pathetic, whoever gave Vin Diesel the idea that he can act. Like an earlier reviewer observes it\u0027s about who\u0027s dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review\n",
    "\nI can\u0027t give it any less than one star but what the heck, The girls were hot so there\u0027s the one star. Other than that I am literally dumber after watching this movie! I swear to god! I passed out after watching this film because I got so stupid I forgot to breathe! They should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job! Even if they just ran around the set yelling \"1,2,3, Potato Salad, March!\" The dialogue would have been 1000 times better. Message to the producer:\nGive it up loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
    "\nI love Chazz P. and I can see why he would want to give the other side of the Castellano epic, but man is this movie boring.  Castellano has to be one of the most uninvolved mobsters ever to take the reins of a crime family.  If you know the history of this guy, than you should agree, and if you don\u0027t, read some books about him.  As powerful as he was, he sure didn\u0027t know much about running a crime family as did his predecessors, which this film doesn\u0027t portray.  The film also has terrible actors portraying both Sammy the Bull and John Gotti.  An insult at that.  If you like mafia movies and don\u0027t care about the history of its real-life characters than by all means watch it.  If you do, skip it, you\u0027d be better off reading a book\n",
    "\nTo violent for anyone! This movie is horrible. The cast is good, but the plot stinks! Its just this family who have super powers. Then this kid wanted to be Mr. Incredibles side kick. (in a way)Mr. Incredible says no so then he hates him. Then the kid turns evil and kills people, and wants every body to like him. Thats origanal. There are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes, and there is way to much violence. Killing, guns, punching, bombs, and they say stupid words sometimes. I do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence. So I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Especially the 2 disc special edition!\n",
    "\nWell what can I say about this movie? Well one thing is: It wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d expected. Those who\u0027d seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but I still wanted to see it. I was wrong and they were right.\nThe movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild\u0027, bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care. \nMarty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help\u0027 him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs. That\u0027s basically the whole movie in a nutshell. The group fight, Alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat. End of story.\nThe entire look of the 3D Animation was terrible as well. They should have continued with Shrek 3 instead of making this movie. It\u0027s pointless to watch.\nThe most interesting thing in the entire DVD was the `Penguins Christmas Caper\u0027, which wasn\u0027t the short movie itself, but the man who played Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is the polar bear.\nFor those of you planning to buy this DVD, stay away. It\u0027s a huge rip off. It\u0027s just something to keep you waiting for Shrek 3\n",
    "\nBeing a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, I bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work. Nope, this movie is garbage.

The acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous. Over all, it\u0027s not a movie worth buying.\n",

    "\n\nIt is unfair to judge a children\u0027s film by the same non-technical standards you would judge a film made for a more mature audience. That said, I had a difficult time figuring out the intended target audience for Disney\"s \"A Far Off Place\", an odd mix of \"Alaska\", \"Walkabout\", and \"Blue Lagoon\". Since each of these films had a different target audience (children for \"Alaska\", adults for \"Walkabout\", and teens for \"Blue Lagoon\"), \"A Far Off Place\" suffers from a poorly matched and confused mix of story elements, the attempt to appeal to multiple target audiences ultimately makes it unappealing to all audiences.\n\nDespite some positive comments on this database, \"A Far Off Place\" did not impress audiences at the time of its 1993 release and has generated little interest since. Based on stories by South African writer Laurens van der Post, \"A Far Off Place\" is the story of three teenagers: Nonnie (Reece Witherspoon as a girl raised on South African game preserve), Harry (Ethan Randall as a visiting American boy) and Sorel Bok (as their young Bushman guide Xhabbo) who attempt to evade a gang of ivory poachers by fleeing into the Kalahari Desert. Ethan Randall is actually Ethan Embry from \"Can\u0027t Hardy Wait\".\n\nAlthough recommended for ages eight and up, most younger viewers will be deeply disturbed by the early scenes, where the family\u0027s idyllic life is ended by a night attack on their home by the poachers. The house is burned and the parents are murdered. And more mature viewers will be deeply disturbed by the next scene where Nonnie turns into Rambo and kills most of gang in a sequence credible only to a horrified eight-year old. \n\nAt this point it begins to look like \"Walkabout\", a story of an Australian girl, her little brother, and a young Aborigine on his ritual journey to manhood. In a significant deviation from the book Xhabbo\u0027s wife does not accompany the group into the desert. \n\n\"Walkabout\u0027s\" more adult theme of interracial sexual awakening is replaced by a \"Blue Lagoon\" romance between the two white teenagers, a reflection of the film\u0027s narrower values and more modest ambitions.\n\nThe scenes shot in the desert are almost the equal of \"Alaska\" for scenic beauty but \"Alaska\"s\" more realistic survival challenges are superior to the blend of survival skills and mystic powers that Xhabbo demonstrates to his two companions during their journey. There is an element of \"The Gods Must Be Crazy\" in this clash of cultures but the film does not go very far (bad pun intended) with the concept. \n\nBoth \"Alaska\" and \"A Far Off Place\" insert the element of poacher violence into the journey, to the detriment of the basic story. \u0027Walkabout\" did not need this and found sufficient story material in the enormity of the survival experience.\n\nBok is excellent as the young Bushman and Randall/Embry\u0027s performance is solid if unexceptional. Those interested in Witherspoon\u0027s early work would be better served checking out her great debut performance in \"The Man In the Moon\" and avoiding this career misstep. Those looking for a children/family story should stick with \"Alaska\".\n\nThen again, what do I know? I\u0027m only a child\n",
    "\nWell, this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get, unfortunately: the female teenage protagonist (played by Witherspoon, whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here) acts masculine and heroic, the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant. At one ridiculous point, the girl runs around acting like a commando, a veritable one-gal army, blowing up the bad guys, while the boy hides in a cave sniveling. Later, when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal\u0027s backpack as they cross a desert, the gal snaps at him, Bella Abzug-style, and walks quickly ahead, leaving him in the dust. Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here, and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men. Of course, in the real world, the result for such manly girls, once they become women, is that men do not choose them and they remain alone, and therefore become bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men, of course. In this movie, the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy, masculine gal--but that\u0027s why they call them movies. When are these post-modern writers, artists, and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism, they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not prefer masculine females. Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them, not COMPETE with them. Men crave FEMININITY in females, not FEMINISM. Wow, is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie, at least his character does progress a little bit: by the end of the movie, instead of craven and flippant, he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut, if that is even a step upward. But the plucky gal--she\u0027s still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations.\nUh, another problem with this movie--and there are many--is when the kids are going through the Kalahari Desert, something which should be, and for a time is here depicted as, a foreboding and life-threatening task. Yet we see Witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog; and we see the boy\u0027s flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner, considering the dire situation they are in. The sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted, inane scenes.\nLook, I dig Disney kid movies--more realistic ones. You know, old style Disney movies. You take \"Old Yeller\" for example. Now there was a quality kid movie, and quite true to life. \nThis movie was not. It had a plastic, spoiled-American-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout. Disney has gone down the tubes. In any number of ways, they\u0027ve been subverted by radical Marxist agendas (Note: One more of these was the fact that an African Bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his PC pagan religion--something called \"tapping,\" while the Caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-PC Judeo-Christian religion--this is bias, folks, leftwing, PC bias, same as the aforementioned feminist bilge). I am learning to run, not walk, away from Disney stuff, and this movie was further cause for me to do so.\n",
    "\nHaving watched great movies in the Bible series such as Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Samson and Delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures, I was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film. What a let down by this anachronism. How low can one go! This is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of God.\n\nIf you do not believe in God, have never read the Bible, particularly Genesis but have heard of Noah from hearsay, perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value, a mediocre one at that.\n\nIf you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of Noah\u0027s ArK, don\u0027t aggravate yourself. Avoid this movie like a plague.\n",
    "\nThis movie is not very realistic.  The sets are great!, but the story is a Biblical SNAFU!  They had the chance to embellish the real story, without compromizing the Bible\u0027s account, but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later, which impeached any incredibility it might have had. I didn\u0027t like it much for that reason. \n",
    "\n\"The Ring Two\" is a horror film that gets so bogged down in the minutiae of its storytelling that it simply forgets to be scary.  Naomi Watts and David Dreckman return as the mother and son who have recently fled to a remote section of Oregon in an attempt to escape the murderous clutches of Samara, the ghost of a young girl whom they encountered in the previous film.  However, like any specter worth her salt, Samara has managed to track the pair down and quickly begins her scheme of possessing the boy as a way of returning to the land of the living.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily under-whelming thriller that is little more than a series of extremely mild shocks (if you even want to call them that) interrupted by long stretches of hopelessly dull exposition.  The story itself makes very little sense, and the climax is so blas� and half-hearted that I couldn\u0027t be sure the movie had actually ended until the credits started rolling by.  \"The Ring Two\" has a few impressive special effects up its sleeve, but not nearly enough to relieve the tedium that afflicts so much of the movie.  \n\nIn a mere two installments, this series seems already to have run its course.  If this \"Ring\" comes a-callin`, don`t answer\n",
    "\n\nIf you like Murder-Mysteries; you might like this. Attractive leads perform an average script. \n\nTechnically, good costumes, good lighting, attractive sets. The story holds your attention. The detective is interesting, and his sleuthing has some interest. If you like a light Whodunnit; you may like this. As good as anything on TV today. I rated this 2-stars, compared to \"Road to Avonlea, Third season\" mystery episode with Christopher Reeve, which I rate 4-stars. Not as clever as the TV show \"Columbo\"; but the period setting may make up for this. \n\nThis did not have what I was looking for, some adventure, more believability, more charm, and more cleverness. \n\nThe sets are attractively \"staged\"; rather than sets that take you there. Has pleasant characters; but not deep. Some good humor personality with the servants. The appeal is for one who likes a light, Whodunnit detective film, in a period setting; without my great expectations. I remember \"Young Sherlock Holmes\" as better; though I saw it a long time ago.\n",

    "\nThey spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can\u0027t distinguish one\u0027s ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they\u0027re talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let\u0027s not talk about that - let\u0027s just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don\u0027t! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don\u0027t even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don\u0027t they address this?  This \"docu\" is more slanted than \"Fahrenheitt 911\" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking.\n",

    "\n  Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM\u0027s unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes\nthe reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore\u0027s twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the \nprimary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM\u0027s problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and \nhow now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough.

    "\nThere are two main reasons why this Superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects.\n\nWhat Singer and company have missed is the heart of Superman - virtues.  The ideal of the American way (noticably absent) is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice.  Donner made the mistake in the 70\u0027s of having Superman sleep with Lois, and now Singer adds insult to injury by having Superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he doesn\u0027t take responsibility for (deadbeat dad).  Using his super powers to invade the privacy of Lois in her home, drags Superman down to the level of creepy (peeping tom).\n\nThe second issue concerns personality.  Routh and Bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry.  These are the two ingredients that made Reeves and Kidder so endearing.\n\nA new director, writers, and cast is needed.  Until then, at least there\u0027s Superman 1.\n",

The reviews I\u0027ve seen for this movie are way too generous I must say.  Believe me when I say that I am not a strict critic...I can be easily entertained by the corny ones.  But this one could not be salvaged, and one star is much more than it deserves.  The fact that is in black and white can be overlooked, but the bad acting, and pseudo-artistic scenes reminded me of a film made in middle school.

    "\nI was really looking forward to movie.  My goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period.  Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50\u0027s Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching.  My real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting.  Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, a stage coach is robbed, my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors.  They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.  As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn\u0027t rehearse more.  I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment.  I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time.

It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves.

    "\nCinema-wise, you know you\u0027re witnessing the beginning of the end when the best Hollywood can come up with is a SEQUEL to a REMAKE (it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film).  But that is exactly what \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" turns out to be - and the result, quality-wise, is pretty much what one would expect.\n\nThis is one of those alleged family comedies in which the adults (the male adults at any rate) are infinitely more immature in their attitude and behavior than the children they are raising.  Steve Martin returns as the prolific father of twelve who is beginning to sense that his children, as they are growing older, no longer want to spend quality time together as a family.  To rectify the situation, he takes them all on a vacation to a favorite lake resort - a move that threatens to turn into a full-scale disaster when the Bakers find themselves embroiled in a fierce competition with a neighboring family of snooty overachievers led by Eugene Levy, a patriarch who runs his brood with so much spit-and-polish regimentation that he makes Captain Von Trapp look like a touchy-feely pushover in comparison.\n\nOne might be tempted to call this a distended version of a \"Brady Bunch\" episode and leave it at that, but even that show, for all its lack of sophistication, didn\u0027t portray the father as a total and irredeemable doofus with serious developmental issues and the emotional maturity of a bratty six-year-old.    Besides the daddy-is-a-dope stereotype, all \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" has to offer is lame slapstick, a silly pre-pubescent \"Romeo and Juliet\" subplot, and push-button scenes of emotional uplift in which a crescendo of swelling violins serves as the cue for the tears to start flowing.  The drearily unoriginal screenplay comes replete with the requisite dog-humping incidents and poop jokes, and not one but TWO scenes of an elderly handicapped gentleman rolling off into the lake in a wheelchair.   \n\nAny more of these films and Planned Parenthood won\u0027t have to mount a fundraising drive for years to come\n",
    "\nAfter reading the novel by Jane Yolen with my 7th grade classes, I was eager to view the film version.  I had heard conflicting views of the film- it\u0027s great, it\u0027s horrible, etc.  After viewing it for myself, I must agree with those who gave it negative reviews.  However, despite its lack-luster performance, the film did serve a purpose in the classroom.\n\nTrue, the film leaves something to be desired. They change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them.  Editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story.  Rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely.  Major events in the rising action are left out, thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing.  Overall, very few of my students liked the film adaptation of Jane Yolen\u0027s novel, which they found so riveting.  \nOn a brighter side, because of so many differences, viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through T-Charts and Venn diagrams.  It also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills. \nAfter reading the novel and viewing the film, most of my students agreed that the book was much better- something a reading teacher loves to hear!\n",

It was mad and release by Warners (MARVEL\u0027s biggest rival and DC\u0027s parent company), This new take on the X-Men had them behave like horny teenage doofuses,and don\u0027t get me started on the crappy writing.   Just like X2 was not the X-Men, this show was also the same.  It was in Name Only, and speaking as the only loyal Marvel fan here, That says i all\n",
    "\nThis movie is just not scary.  I\u0027m a HUGE horror movie fan and this movie has no tension in it, no edge of your seat fear.  I liked the sequel \"Devil\u0027s Rejects\", but that isn\u0027t much of a \"horror\" movie either (unless you think \"From Dusk Til Dawn\" is scary).  \"1,000 Corpses\" is about as scary as \"Hostel\".  It should never be mentioned in the same breath as \"Texas Chainsaw\", because other than trying to look like a gritty 70\u0027s horror flick, it has nothing in common with \"Chainsaw\".\n\nIt has a few moments, but they are ruined by cartoon-like scenarios.  Still Zombie has potential, his follow up \"Reject\u0027s\" was a definite improvement.\n\nI didn\u0027t hate it, it\u0027s just not a scary horror movie.  Nothing new, no tension, but entertaining in some scenes, so I\u0027m giving it 2 stars\n",
    "\nIn essence, this is a Texas Chainsaw remake, but here\u0027s the difference, and why it\u0027s far inferior. I don\u0027t care one iota for the \"victims.\" I can barely tell the females apart. The guys are so obnoxious, I look forward to them dying. Unlike Texas Chainsaw (parts one and two, horror masterpieces!), this movie shows the \"psycho family\" (hmmm... kind of like Texas Chainsaw?) far too much. A little goes a long way, too much? OVERKILL! Many plot holes, and take away the music, there was some really bad acting. It gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style, and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed. But in general, Rob Zombie should not get writing credit for this. It\u0027s Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only nowhere near as good\n",
    "\nI hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  \"One Star\" seems like a generous rating\n",
    "\nOkay, the script is not the most imaginative I\u0027ve ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben\u0027s best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn\u0027t even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don\u0027t they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn\u0027t even mind the fact that the whole \"We\u0027re married and my husband\u0027s a doctor.\" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he\u0027s pretending to be a doctor and he\u0027s on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D\u0027ya think someone might have a heart attack and \"Dr. Holmes\" might have to step up?  And uh, they\u0027re pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there\u0027s the best man and maid of honor! D\u0027ya think they\u0027re gonna get busted?\n\nWhat killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah\u0027s little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they\u0027re not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he\u0027s breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let\u0027s just go ahead and get married after all.\n\nHuh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn\u0027t have a clue what he wants in life, and I\u0027m expected to believe they lived happily ever after?\n\nNot only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us \"don\u0027t do it!\" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It\u0027s just marriage. It\u0027s romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!\n\nIt\u0027s been my experience, when things aren\u0027t feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap\n",
    "\nThere is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.\n\nWhere did Eye for an Eye go wrong?  I don\u0027t think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters.  I have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.  What was Sally Field\u0027s job?  I know that is a small detail, but it better highlights my complaint that our central family (the McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed.  Ed Harris literally walked through his character, proving that Field\u0027s husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion.  The only character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end.  Yet, we didn\u0027t even know that much about him either (which upset me).  Schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well, the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn\u0027t even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from the beginning, but it wasn\u0027t what I wanted to see.  I expected film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996.  It was pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan.  Nothing stood out in this film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and nothing made me feel excited about these actors.  This was a literal \"nothing\" film.  It lent nothing to the cinematic world except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired genre known as the \"Revenge Thriller\".\n\nAfter watching this film I said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me think of a High School drama production.  It was amateur at best, but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is known for being overly dramatic.  This is a pure example of a good thing gone badly.  Sally saw success with it once, but as she continues it only creates bad cinema.  There were times during Sally\u0027s bigger speeches that I found myself laughing.  I couldn\u0027t help myself, but her focus on certain words and clich� reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike.  The same could be said for Ed Harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn\u0027t have to play the outlaying father any further in films.  He was completely wasted in this film.  Was there any emotion with him?  I didn\u0027t see any.  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes.  Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clich�?  Urg, his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers.  Again, the only actor worth watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile.  It was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.  \n\nIf I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go mad myself.  Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer.  Did Kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn\u0027t take us down that darker path.  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers.  This was yet another dark avenue that was not explored.  I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that didn\u0027t catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world.\n\nOverall, in case it wasn\u0027t obvious, this wasn\u0027t a good movie at all.  In fact, I could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again.  I thought only horror movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye it became obvious that it the \"Revenge Thrill\" fell into that same pattern.  The only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not.  Sally Field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while everyone else was forgettable.  The only fun part was watching Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil.  Watch this film for Kiefer, but nothing else.  Skip it!\n\nGrade: * out of ****\n",
    "\nThis is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up.\n\nThe movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland\u0027s character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title.\n\nIn one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally\u0027s character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer\u0027s character when they meet on the street and he talks to her.\n\nI don\u0027t know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity.\n\nI would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. \"Ssssssorry\", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like.\n\n",

    "\nI saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him (he was seeing it for a second time.) After the first ten minutes, I wanted to leave. If you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb American youth from small, hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local Wal-Mart or becoming mince-meat in Iraq, then this movie is for you!  However, if you like movies that actually challenge you to think, don\u0027t waste your time with this one\n",

    "\nI absolutely abhor this film. Want to know why? Because it labled \u0027Valley of the Dolls\u0027 and everything Jacqueline Susann ever wrote into \u0027great campy fun\u0027. Now I don\u0027t know this for certain, but I don\u0027t think Jacqueline Susann wanted people to see her books as cheesy comedies. I think she wanted people to take her work seriously, and with this awfully made film, no one did. To others, the film might be so bad it\u0027s funny, but to devoted fans of the book it\u0027s just depressing. The movie was made in 1967, a year after the book was published and you can see that Jacqueline Susann was ahead of her time, because the film is poorly adapted and very censored. You know you have a problem when the book would receive an R rating if transferred onto the screen, but the movie is only rated PG. Besides the sex scenes, language, pill popping and other thematic elements that are left out, important details to the plot are also missing. Anne\u0027s hatred of Lawrenceville, Helen Lawson\u0027s screen time, Jennifer\u0027s complicated and somewhat absuive relationship with Tony, Allen and Gino Cooper, Henry\u0027s character development, Jennifer\u0027s relationship with the Senator (and the reason she committs suicide), the tragic ending, etc are all either missing or are shortened down. I don\u0027t care if the movie would have been almost three hours long, I think if they had stuck close enough to the book, then everything would have been fine. What a shame. And please don\u0027t mention the casting of actors. Save for Patty Duke, I thought everyone else did a horrible job. Some of the actors didn\u0027t even look the physical part (in the book Anne is actually a blonde, Helen Lawson has dark hair and Jennifer is curvy). The thing that really gets me though is why has this film never been remade? It\u0027s almost forty years later, and I think that this story definately deserves to be given justice and have a proper film adaptation. How about Kate Bosworth as Anne Welles, Scarlett Johansson as Jennifer North, Keira Knightly as Neely O\u0027Hara, Joaquin Phoenix as Lyon Burke, and Liza Minnelli as Helen Lawson? Well I doubt that will ever happen, so in the meantime I recommend reading the book instead, and taking it seriously the way Jacqueline Susann had intended it to be\n",
    "\nNicky Cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment, as he turns  in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi\n",
    "\nThen why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else?  The songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals, which arguably weren\u0027t that bad (\"What a girl wants\" and \"Get this party started\" were fairly tame to begin with).  Just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds\n",
    "\nThis is an intriguing movie that compels the viewer to search for the film\u0027s deeping meaning.  I am sure that I missed much of that meaning.  However, one aspect of it is painful clear.  The crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation.  I found that premise disturbing and unrealistic.  Also, it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex.  If so, this movie could contribute, in a small way, to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof.\n\nWatch this movie if you must, but be critical of its assumptions about male/female relationships.\n\n \n",
    "\nSimply put: the movie is boring.  Clich� upon clich� is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the \"natural\" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son\u0027s death. The lawyer has a drunk \"friend\" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie. \n\nSave your money, save your time, choose another movie.\n",
    "\nThe premise - that one could change specific events in ones\u0027 past through psychic concentration - could have been the foundation for a fascinating thriller.  I don\u0027t condemn the film\u0027s corollary either: that each change produces new, unforseeable tragedies.  It\u0027s the way the story is told - its ham-fisted dialogue and plot, its forced obscenity at every turn - that reveals its teen sensibilities.\n     It is therefore fitting that the director\u0027s preferred ending is included here.  It is the perfect catharsis for teens who \"...wish I was never born!\n",

    "\nRead the Amazon editorial review, they are tiptoeing around saying this movie doesn\u0027t really work.  \n\nModern language, ideas, and sensibilities make the whole thing feel like a contrived stage play.  And it seems to be mostly on stage sets ... there isn\u0027t much of Venice in here, so don\u0027t rent it for that reason.  (Notice I said rent ...)  \n\nThe script is weak.  The setup for the lead character\u0027s transition to life as a courtesan is abbreviated and unconvincing.  There are too many horrible moments for this to be romantic.  The story has so much more potential.\n\nThe only reason to see this movie is to check out Catherine McCormack.  Rufus Sewell is always good as well.\n\nOtherwise the casting is absurd.  Fred Ward and Oliver Platt stand out as being miscast.  Jacqueline Bisset fails to persuade here\n",
    "\nthere is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable \"crash\", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst \"mainstream\" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek\n",
    "\nJust rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I\u0027m a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.\n\nWhile the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..\n",
    "\nThis is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills.  It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner.  The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery.\n\nThe politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script:\n\nBong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1:  ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing...\nBHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts)  \"Evil Corporation\"?  Why are you being redundant?\n\nThe only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great.  Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance.  I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it\n",
    "\n   In the early 1990\u0027s this movie was definitely made for that era. Just look at the clothing and hair. High top fades etc. Graffiti Bridge was definitely unique. It should have been released on cable t.v. instead of the theater. It was more of a musical then a actual movie. Prince somehow has his own ways of doing things in his own world. And he may not care about record sales or what people think of what he puts out, but it makes even the most loyal fans question what he is doing. The talent he has is amazing but he\u0027s become just a mediocur artist. This lack luster film may be remembered a hundred years from now. But as of now it\u0027s just what you call a get up and walk out film. I\u0027m a prince fanatic, a die hard fan, but man the potential this guy has to be a mega star of our time he fails to meet. You haft to make people believe in you and really reach them and relate. If only Prince could relate to what people are feeling now and what they want. Prince somehow fell behind because the youth of this generation moved on while he stayed stagnet. I think he shut the world out and it just went on turning. Record sales may not matter to him, but fans you must keep loyal. Graffiti bridge is a film in my collection and I just look at it as my collection but nothing more. It\u0027s a film that makes you think. It\u0027s spiritual and there are some warm moments. Now Purple Rain is something not to be missed. I recommend that one. Enjoy\n",

The film also pretty much stays focused on just a couple of areas of rubble.  I found nothing at all in this film that brought any emotion to me other than boredom.  I own several other documentaries that I watch over and over as I don\u0027t want to forget the feelings I felt on 911 but this film is lacking greatly in bringing any kind of human element to this horror that was inflicted on our country.

    "\nLike other reviewers, I found MeetThe Parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at Hollywood so I figured \"Why not?\"\nWell here\u0027s why not. It presents the main character\u0027s parents as crude, clueless buffoons, and having no social judgement whatsoever, but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip. And for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on Fantasy Island. I\u0027m surprised they didn\u0027t include a sex with a midget scene. Nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former CIA agent, who was set up as an object of ridicule. Oh, and they had to be Jewish too. Streisand and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way. {\"Our people don\u0027t shoot ducks, dear\")\nDo former CIA agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built RV that would cost at least $250 k?

    "\nI\u0027ll cut to the meta-chase since plot and story have already been well outlined in previous reviews...\n\nThe basic message of this film seems to be that state controlled \"education\" is worthy of resurrection and total dictatorship is the way to achieve it. Though the latter point is probably true, the former is questionable indeed. Why try and save an obviously moribund and mindless system of government indoctrination from its own demise? Don\u0027t blame the kids, you have only to look at the state of the world to see the utter failure that so-called educated people have already created everywhere, with world fascism now its ultimate fruitage, and the kids at some level know it...Clearly we urgently need a new vision of education altogether, but this film only asks us to glorify what has already died...\n\n",
    "\nYes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I\u0027m concerned.\n\nI love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.\n\nBut Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn\u0027t.\n\nBy now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....\n\nThe script is idiot from page one.\nThe killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn\u0027t the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.\n\nBut... ok... let\u0027s give the screenwriters a break.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.\n\nLater on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.\n\nWas I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????\n\nWant more?\n\nIn an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???\n\nIn the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).\n\nFirst line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive.\nSecond line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.\n\nWe have none of that here.\n\nInstead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.\n\nObviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that\u0027s why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.\n\nBut no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under \"The story ends bad\" label.

    "\nI made the mistake of watching it after seeing how many stars (4) it received from other viewers. The plot was butchered, the characters twisted, the story ruined, a pure agony.\n \nMarilla is fat and ugly. Wasn\u0027t it supposed to be Rachel Lynde\u0027s character? Matthew is sly and conniving and very outspoken. What happened to endearing shy Matthew? Rachel Lynde had been merged with Mrs. Barry, Dianna\u0027s mother, and hence Mrs. Rachel Barry (Oh brother). Dianna is a petit blond and not a dimpled raven black haired damsel, who gets married behind the scenes without her bosom friend who was sent to Queens at 18 as a punishment.

Do yourself a favor, if you really like the Anne books don\u0027t watch this movie.\n \nOh, and I do wish Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) will fall in love with the books and make proper and ACCURATE movies out of them.

    "\nI\u0027ll be right up front and admit that I do not own this DVD. I hesitated writing a review for it because of that fact. But then I realized that if you\u0027re reviewing a DVD, 90% of the review must be based on the movie itself, and having saw the movie when it was released, and having seen it again on the various cable channels, I felt I could write a respectable reveiw.\n\nFrankly, the movie barely approaches a \"B-Movie\" status. It\u0027s only claim to fame is that it was the first major Hollywood motion picture that did not portray homosexuals in a bad light.\n\nThe plot is rather unbelievable, naming the fact that all three main characters are leaders in their field.... successful author, high-ranking network producer, top-rate doctor. Nobody has a profession, or is in a position, with which the audience can relate. The dialog is forced and, at times, rather cliche. Acting is acceptable, though supporting cast members are rather amateurish. Direction is functional, at best.\n\nOne glaring problem is the tendency for the movie to suddenly switch from drama to documentary. After or before key scenes, the camera cuts to a monologue from one of the main characters. The effect is startling, doesn\u0027t advance the story, and only serves to distract the viewers and lessen the already-weak emotional impact of the film.\n\nTo its credit, the actors did whole-heartedly portray gay characters and gay love scenes. At the time, gay characters were never portrayed in a positive light from the media, and it was a great risk to do so here. There were no previous movie experiences of this topic that the director and actors were able to draw on, and they did the best they could.\n\nIt was a very ambitious project and was supposed to be ground-breaking and revolutionary, but the weaknesses in the film never raised it high enough to truly make much of a difference in society. This is absolutely proven by the fact that Brokeback Mountain, released about two decades later, had to work very hard to break the same stereotypes that Making Love previously attempted to break. The difference is that Brokeback Mountain was a true work of art impeccable in its execution and actually broke ground and stereotypes, and Making Love all but disappeared in the annals of time.\n\nIf you\u0027re a collector of good film, this really wouldn\u0027t be part of your collection. To add into a collection of films showing early portrayals of homosexuals and homosexual relationships, it would be very appropriate. Sadly, it really is good for only that one reason, as part of a collection of gay films throughout the years\n",
    "\nThis series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12-year-old, but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters. Most of the plot\u0027s famous \"unpleasantness\" is just tacked on to the main story, and is of no significance.\n\nApart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses, nothing much gets accomplished thought the series. The main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series, so don\u0027t bother waiting for any meaningful information from her. The male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he\u0027s been transported to, inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him.\n\nThe most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman, who\u0027s included in the story for no reason except to be abused- you can almost hear the writers saying, \"I got it! Let\u0027s rape a little girl, that\u0027ll make it REAL! Yeah, Yeah, I like it!\" Having served her purpose, the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series, so a little more misery can be dumped on her.\n\nAll the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation. The releative standout would be the villian, who suffers from bipolarism, and alternates between terror, anger, delight, and misery, somtimes all within the same scene. Too bad that was about all he did in the show.\n\nWell, that\u0027s about enough. If you have an appetite for \"Kid saves alternate universe\" themed anime, then you may like this. But I found it lifeless and massively overrated\n",
    "\nAlexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority. The character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by Aristotle. Watching this movie you get the feeling that Alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident.\n\nThere is far too much emphasis here on the non-essential, and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of Alexander\u0027s strained relationships with his mother, father, friends and his own identity. If you\u0027re looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient Greece, look elsewhere. This is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant.\n",

    "\nGreat movie. The problem is in the medium of delivery.  There are 2 dvds in the package. Each dvd contains approximately 1/2 of the movie.  The audience/customer would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd.\n\nIn addition, the 2nd dvd is defective.   The scene where Alexander\u0027s father is assasinated consists of some normal footage, many lengthy \u0027still\u0027 pictures, no picture at all for a period of time, and a short period that looked like satelite feed was breaking -- all on a dvd that\u0027s supposed to be flawless\n",
    "\nThe first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don\u0027t know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don\u0027t know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn\u0027t, so that\u0027s why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we\u0027re not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn\u0027t turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat \"hero\" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that\u0027s true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, \u0027dreamboat\u0027 takes the turn as lead character, and it\u0027s his story we\u0027re following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it\u0027s her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out \u0027dreamboat\u0027 and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don\u0027t have the same truth in mind - it\u0027s about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it\u0027s not the comic book variety, isn\u0027t fun for an audience, it\u0027s just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that\u0027s the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed\n",

The gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along. The new director Brian Yuzna does a good job taking over Stuart Gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a Sci/Fi channel movie that would debut on TV and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast(Except Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott),lower production values and lower budget,and tepid to atrocious acting. If you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of Beyond the Re-Animator. \n",
    "\nThere is one thing I finally grasped upon watching \u0027The 40 Year Old Virgin\u0027, however.  I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique (\u0027The 40 Year Old Virgin\u0027) are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas.\n\nOf course, they\u0027re laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything.\n\nThis film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on \u0027The Office\u0027, and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that\u0027s neither here nor there).   It certainly couldn\u0027t be because it\u0027s funny.\n\nThe general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise.  That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not.  \n\nThat concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not.  \n\nThat concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up\u0027s of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not.\n\nThat concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not.\n\nYou get the drift.  Maybe the boat left and I wasn\u0027t on the boat.  Maybe I\u0027m not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles.\n\nIf you like juvenile humor, watch something like \u0027Better Off Dead\u0027 or \u0027Caddyshack\u0027.  Watch a movie that doesn\u0027t have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBill Cosb\n",
    "\nOne of the most overrated comedy shows ever. Basically the calibre of a high school talent show. In a way it reminds me of Tom Goes To The Mayor, seemingly fitting into a comedy niche I don\u0027t understand which is more about being weird than being clever, but it seems like it\u0027s even more about being dull than being weird. I\u0027ve heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head. I think these guys took that a bit too much to heart. Maybe the fans see some subtle naunces I\u0027m missing, but to me it seems like I could have written most of this material with little effort.\n",
    "\nThis movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying \nthe Gospel of John beautifully through the movie - and slapping Yahushua/Jesus\nand serious scholars in the face with the other hand.

    "\nFor a topic this edgy, this is an incredibly dull film. The actors are good enough, mind you. But they can only do so much, because the real problem with this film is the script. For the first twenty minutes or so of screen time, the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented Natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother. (You *might* not pick up on that fact at first, since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film--certainly the two *look* nothing alike.) Finally the main part of the plot begins, with Natalie just as discontented, despite being married to a wealthy and quirky-but-ultimately-nice guy (Alan Rickman, for whose sake I watched this film at all--not worth it), and with her brother seemingly happy with his life, but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister. From that point, things spiral--no, that\u0027s too dynamic a word to describe it--*mosey* out of control, with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair, the poor brother (the only particularly sympathetic character in the film) becoming obsessed with the relationship, and the worried hubby\u0027s suspicions growing (although not in the right direction). There\u0027s so much here that *could* have been fascinating and compelling, but isn\u0027t, on any level. The plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi-believable situation, scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet. This video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops--mercifully for the public--but I certainly wouldn\u0027t recommend resorting to buying it. \n",
    "\nI wasn\u0027t impressed by this film.   First of all, I could never \"buy\" that Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen were a brother and sister.  Nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related.  Nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother-sister relationship.  They might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems, because that\u0027s how the relationship came across. \n\nPersonally, outside of the button-pushing topic of incest, I found this movie dull and sometimes tawdry.  Clive Owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent Lawrence Harvey, and Saskia Reeves was simply annoying (like her character, a weak, hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man.) The only actors who showed any real feeling were Alan Rickman as the husband, and Karl Johnson as Clive Owen\u0027s AIDS-stricken boss.  Karl Johnson has the best scene in the film:  he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair, obviously suffering from AIDS, and this very fact intimidates the guy he\u0027s gone to meet.  The man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the Karl Johnson character, and in the end Karl Johnson seizes the guy\u0027s sandwich and bites it, then offers the other guy a bite, pushing the sandwich into his face, basically...it\u0027s a scene that crackles with his anger \u0026 pain at being trapped by this illness, which is going to kill him, while this corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally.  \n\nBut aside from that wake-up call, the film dragged, and by the time Clive Owen\u0027s character was shouting in the climatic scene his realization that he\u0027s been used by his \"sister\" to inflate her sense of self-importance, I was long gone, with my head nodding.  \n\nMuch ado about nothing, frankly.  One star for the soundtrack; one star for the performances of Alan Rickman (what little he has to work with, he shines) and Karl Johnson.  Die-hard Clive Owen fans such as myself; eeeh, pass on this.       \n",
    "\nThis DVD is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost.  The film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes.

In all honesty, as much as I enjoy movies of the Civil War, I\u0027d like to return this for a refund.  Alas, that\u0027s a prospect that has,indeed, gone with the wind.  Thumbs down to this one\n",

Moreover,I am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating. What is going on? Is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about? Am I naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain? Where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work,hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema\u0027s most tedious and overrated\nsleep inducing actor Ralph Fiennes?\nHow I long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do - entertain.Sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as \"The Constant Gardener\" it appears that we unfortunate \"real\" film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future.\n",
    "\nThis movie is a rehash of the first, but it is a crappy, unconvincing, emotionally uninspiring movie. \n\nLet me guess what part 3 will be about: A guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time, does not alter that timeline the way he wants (i.e. always worst case scenario) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else\n",
    "\nAfter seeing the real show in L.A., my girlfriend and I were really looking forward to the DVD.  And after last night\u0027s viewing, I went to bed kinda creeped out and actually felt a little guilty that I didn\u0027t like the whole thing that much.  I\u0027m relieved to see that other fans just couldn\u0027t handle all the audience shots either.  This DVD tries so hard to define Paul\u0027s place in our lives and his impact on the world through his music that it ends up blowing it for those of us who already know, feel, and live it.  They tried to document his music and its impact instead of just filming it.  If you\u0027re from Mars and this is your first day on Earth, you might appreciate the way the DVD attempts to explain the relevance of Paul\u0027s work.  If you\u0027ve been on this planet for awhile, chances are you\u0027re already up to speed and just want to see the band and hear the music\n",
    "\nThis really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book, if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject. i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out, and i accept that, but to completely change the ending is not excusable.

    "\nFirst off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in \u002795 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn\u0027t like the film. I\u0027ve seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.\n\nAnyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..\n\nHowever, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..\n\nThis DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug\u0027s Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..\n\nFinally, they didn\u0027t include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That\u0027s a huge crime in itself.\n",
    "\nI consider myself a huge pixar fan. This is easily the most insipid Pixar movie ever. Pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one.

    "\nSaw this Movie at the actual Premier in NYC and met Sturla Gunnerson and I told him exactly how I felt. Gerard Butler needed a bigger horse. I expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater. Sarah Polleys language was uncalled for in the film. They could have written better lines. The fade in, fade out was like a child filming with a video camera. The film was funny at times and mixed with gore. Like eating sweet and sour. Being a Gerard Butler fan I was distressed after watching this film. Why did he do this? Gerry Butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes. This unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like The Jury, Please or The Phantom of The Opera. I expect Mr. Butler to be past these B films and know he does have much better stuff in the works...than goodness.\n\nAll in all the film was terrible. The scenery was captivating and breathless. I at times found myself saying wow, but it was about the story of Beowulf \u0026 Grendel and it did not meet my expectations that I have read even in the easiest translations. All I can say is Mr. Butler your an incredible talent, becareful what you choose. Movies like this can paved the way to a downward spiral. I know Mr. Butler is indeed better than this.   \n",
    "\nThe basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a \u0027killing-machine\u0027 integrate back into society.  Yes, it\u0027s been done before but still holds promise.  The plot was adequate.\n\nThe acting was believable - no complaints there.  I particularly enjoyed Sean Pertwee as \u0027Mace\u0027.  And Jason Isaacs has long been a favorite actor.\n\nBut what ruined the movie for me was the science.  I\u0027m not a fanatic - I have no problems with FTL travel or spaceships \u0027banking\u0027 on turns or loud explosions in space in movies.  And I realize that movies are not \u0027real\u0027.  But I\u0027ve never seen more \u0027bad\u0027 science in any one movie.  My son and I watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers.  \n\nI could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night.  It spoiled the whole movie for me\n",

    "\nGROWING UP, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE TURTLES BUT THIS DVD STINKS.  THE ONLY PLUS IS THAT I CAN HAVE THE ORIGINAL EPISODES IN CONVENIENT DVD FORM RATHER THAN TRACK DOWN A BUNCH OF OLD VHS TAPES.  THIS DVD IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE SEASON ONE AND SEASON THREE DVD\u0027S.  THEY ALL HAVE SPELLING ERRORS AND TITLE ERRORS AND EACH ONE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCE IN A HALF-A$$ FASHION JUST TO CAPITALIZE ON THE NEW TURTLE\u0027S SUCESS.  WHICH BY THE WAY THE NEW TURTLES ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD ONES.  ON THE SEASON THREE DVD THE PACKAGE REFERS TO \"BEBOP\" AS BEBOB, NICE EDITING JOB. I GUESS IT WAS TO HARD TO GET THAT ONE RIGHT.  ALSO ALL THREE OF THE DVD\u0027S ARE BARE BONES WITH NO SPECIAL FEATURES.  THE PRICE DOES HOWEVER REFLECT THE CRAPPY JOB THE STUDIO DID ON THIS MOST OF THESE DVD\u0027S CAN BE PURCHASED FOR AROUND 10 BUCKS.

    "\nUnfortunatly this DVD set is defective. On disc 1 episode 3 the picture just freezes and then loops back to the opening scene. I sent one back to Amazon then got a replacement and had to send that one back as well. So I thought maybe the ones at the store might not be defective so I bought a copy at Target and it\u0027s the same problem! I\u0027ve written to Anchor Bay twice and they haven\u0027t bothered to reply. This situation really angers me because I love this season but am not going to waste money on a defective product.

    "\nI got this movie on sale a couple years ago.  It looked pretty good, but you know how most of that goes.  I really lke movies like Scream, I thought it would be like that, but nope.  This movie was a hundred percent perdictable.  I knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie.  From the first seen you can tell it\u0027s gonna suck.  *Spoiler* The first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway, when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out.  The lights flicker (Wow how original) and a person... in a really, really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax.  This is what happens throughout the entire movie.  Don\u0027t waste your time or money.  If you really want to see it i would suggest renting it... not worth more than 3.00 anytime\n",
    "\nI guess I expected more out of this movie but I confess I was mildly disappointed in it. At first, the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling. Still, it was a great cast; Dean Martin was particularly adept at westerns, much more so than Frank Sinatra, who pretty much plays Frank Sinatra in this one. It is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies, in this case, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress. The bad guys are well represented by Victor Buono and Charles Bronson. A fun movie but not particularly memorable. \n",
    "\nBeware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that.  Was real disappointed by 9th Gate.  This film is tepid, there is none of the satanic intensity/ambiance that you find in \u0027Rosemary\u0027s Baby\u0027 It\u0027s too Hollywood, surprisingly, considering the maverick presence of Depp/Polanski. Film opens well, with a suicide and Depp\u0027s opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence, but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere.  Exorcist 3, which I was equally disappointed in, at least was more satanic.  I won\u0027t spoil anything for those who do want to see it, but the showdown scene between Depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed.  Emmanuelle Seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a Demona. And the \u0027showdown with the devil\u0027 is a letdown to say the least.  This film could have been great but Polanski dropped the ball, considering he was the producer/director/co-screenwriter, and the film fails in all three areas. It\u0027s not horrible, so I give it 2 stars.  But don\u0027t buy this film, rent it only.  Buy Angel Heart instead\n",
    "\nOK, Basquiat, at age 19- see the actual person. PERIOD(so wonderfully played by Wright  in movie \"Basquiat\")What a major trainwreck of film this is.Should have stayed where it was buried. Sorry, won\u0027t waste my time to list all the many, very many reasons, already wasted my money.\n",
    "\nI recently discovered this set available on DVD and was very excited, since I\u0027ve been a fan of David Suchet, Agatha Christie and Hercule Poirot for a long time.  I was really looking forward to viewing these, however the poor quality of the image was apparent to me in the first scene and it didn\u0027t get better.  The image quality is actually worse than what I\u0027ve seen on aired on television via cable.  The picture appears to be composed of thousands of tiny vertical lines, which are easily discernable and difficult to ignore.  I\u0027m amazed Acorn would release such a great series in such a low quality package and then charge so much for it.  I will definitely not buy any other titles by Acorn Media\n",
    "\nThe first set was very entertaining--a spy/crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by Moore and Curtis--Set II is another kettle of fish altogether.  The second set is strictly played for laughs--there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin.  Frankly, I hoped for more. \n\nFor those who wish to obtain a true collector\u0027s set of this highly entertaining series, would do better to purchase the Network DVD Megaset Special Edition of The Persuaders, now available thru AmazonUK with some delighful extras including bumpers, promotional materials, episode commentaries, tv spot interviews, title sequences, and hour-long interviews with director, Robert Baker, Tony Curtis, and Roger Moore.  Tony Curtis\u0027 unabashed comments regarding the production team,  guest-star Joan Collins\u0027s antics on the set, and his marijuana bust en route to London for the taping of the first episode, are absolutely priceless in this Network DVD set.  \n\nSurprisingly, the acute observer will notice that some of the episodes in the second box of the A\u0026E set are written by none other than Terry Nation--who would go on to pen a bigger and more serious series SURVIVORS in the UK four years later-when will that be available in the US?\n",
    "\nThis is a documentary about ADHD-not Half Japanese.  Most of the so-called critics can\u0027t remember a dambed thing except for how great they are for recognizing the greatness of Jad while continuously ranting about their major label conspiracy theories.  Penn Jillette even goes so far as to brag about how he conned a homless person out of Jad\u0027s material and then threatened Jad with physical violence if he ever talked to the guy.  If you\u0027re interested in mental illness and sleazy people like Penn Jillette stroking themselves then by all means watch this.  If you\u0027re interested in a great American rock band then just buy the albums and listen.  \n",

    "\nLet me start by saying if you are considering purchase of this film, make your own decision as to if you will purchase it. This is simply my opinion of the film. This movie has horrible fight scenes that don\u0027t appear to be martial arts at all. Basically, Van Damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities, and forces him into a stiff choreographed position. They found some buff guys, okay, big deal. They put them in a film, and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills. These guys don\u0027t have that. Vin Diesel has far better choreography by himself. I have said this about other films and I will say it about this one as well. The cast \u0026 crew benefited from the production of this film, so it doesnt affect them. They go home happy believing they did a good job. You, the consumer, you go and see it on the shelf and recognize a star on the cover and consider buying it. Wrong move as for this film. You will waste money that could have been put into your retirement, or used to buy your children school paper as they educate themselves. Save that money and put it where it belongs. This is not worth your cash\n",
    "\nThis is a very slow movie and it seems more like a documental about war, geopolitics and weapons trade. There is almost no dialogues\n",
    "\nI am confused - Does anyone know who owns this DVD whether this chinese film The Road Home is in FRENCH AUDIO ONLY for this Sony dvd? It\u0027s not in Mandarin, Cantonese or any other chinese dialect? The answer will determine whether I buy it or not.\n",
    "\nmaybe i\u0027m spoiled by big-budget sci-fi films, but i thought this movie kind of stunk. it felt and looked like a TV movie and wasn\u0027t scary, at all. the best/funniest part was how no one could remember the one lady\u0027s name or face, and everyone described her the same way--\"the one with the glasses.\" \"Oh, her--haven\u0027t seen her.\" LOL\n",
    "\nOkay, this movie is a complete waste of time for even the most diehard college basketball fans. \nNick Nolte does a fine job acting like Bob Knight coaching UCLA, or in this case, the fictional Western Univ. That is until the \u0027real\u0027 Bob Knight coaches Indiana against Nolte\u0027s fictional team in the climactic game at the end. \nI was a student at IU when Nolte was going to every Indiana home game in order to study how a real college basketball coach acts. At the time Indiana was number 1 in the nation so Nolte got a lot of attention for his role. However, the acting by Shaq, Hardaway, and Matt Nover was absolutely HORRID!\nThe plot centers around a legendary b-ball court (Nolte as a Knight rip-off right down to the sweater) who is turned to cheating by those nasty alumni and boosters. He takes his dirty team through the season and plays number 1 Indiana at the end. The Real Bob Knight shows up with a cast of former IU b-ball legends and one Duke legend in Bobby Hurley. Anyway, after beating the squeaky clean Indiana team Nolte rats out the alums and boosters for their recruiting violations.\nOther than Nolte nobody gives a really solid performance. Mary McDonnell is good but she\u0027s hardly in the movie. Bob Cousy plays the AD and he does an okay job for a guy who isn\u0027t even an actor. Hardaway is terrible and Matt Nover is just plain horrible.\nThe only part really worth watching is the final game between Indiana and Shaq\u0027s team. It does a good job of taking you inside the huddle as you actually see and hear Knight diagram plays and Nolte does the same. However, it just turns into a highlight reel of Shaq dunking. \nIf you want to see a good b-ball movie just watch Hoosiers again. Also, I\u0027d like to be on whatever mind altering drugs the people who gave this movie 5 stars were taking. \n\n",
    "\nThis is NOT a collection of the superbowls, played from start to finish, as some of the reviewers would lead you to believe.  I got this for my father so he could watch the 49ers tromp all over the Broncos over and over again (since they certainly haven\u0027t been up to much lately!).  Unfortunately, all we got was a collection of highlights, with so many \"up close and personal\" shots, that it was almost nauseating to watch on a bigger screen TV.  An expensive disappointment, surely\n",

    "\nWuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion, betrayal, madness, despair, greed, hatred, and revenge. It\u0027s not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte\u0027s characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you\u0027ve finished the book. \n\nModern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters\u0027 works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both.  \n\nAs Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche\u0027s personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean. \n\nEven if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O\u0027Conner\u0027s appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary.\n\nThis film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests! \n\nMaybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice. This isn\u0027t it\n",
    "\n\nAlias must the most boring and dumbest show on TV in years. The acting is lame and EVERYONE is always looking down and try to act. The story is boring and always so typical James Bond. Don\u0027t waste your money and time on this crappy non-funny piece of crap.\n",
    "\nI\u0027m not sure what everyone else watched, maybe I was expecting to much after reading these other reviews, but I was more than just a little disappointed. The women are attractive that is for sure, but that\u0027s the only thing this movie has going for it. The sex footage was over before is started. At the most they lasted about 30 seconds. I\u0027m not looking for hard-core porn, but this was far from what I was looking for. My suggestion is \u0027buyer-be-aware\u0027\n",
    "\n20 years ago, there was a terrible accident in the mine on Valentine\u0027s Day. The following year one of the miners, Harry Warden, takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident. Since that day, there is no celebration of Valentine\u0027s Day in the little town Valentine\u0027s Buff. Until now (that is 1981). But Harry Warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration.\n\nThe music as music is quite good, but it doesn\u0027t lead the film in any direction, so it\u0027s not helping. The story is recycled, which is good, but could have been much more minimalistic. Why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids? And trying to put a twist to the story by \"explaining\" things is seldom very helpful. The murderar places human hearts in Valentine boxes which is distasteful but not really scary. \n\nA variation on the holiday theme, that could have been a bit more focused.\n",
    "\nAre you kidding me!?  This movie is beyond all redemption.  Sean Conery is a disgrace to himself, running around in a red diaper with pirate boots on.  WTF!  What\u0027s with all the naked women in this thing?  Why do they have to be naked?  They\u0027re hideous looking in the face and body.  My God, my eyes!  If this is the product of the \"love\" generation and what they found to be entertaining and mindfully stimulating, no wonder our society is crazy.  I just can\u0027t get over how profoundly corny and simple the plot and effects are, it\u0027s downright insulting to the human brain.

I don\u0027t know how anyone could try out for a part in a movie without reading the book it was based off of first. (None of the actors read the novel.) Instead, try seeing the 1939 or 1992 version, they ARE worth your time and money\n",
    "\nI first saw the movie poster and wasn\u0027t particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler. But then I heard composer Alan Menken (who had worked on Beauty \u0026 The Beast and Aladdin) was attached and this made me rethink my position. Then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before. Still, I went into the movie theater ready to give \"Home On The Range\" a chance... \n\n...and fell asleep. I found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak. I admit the animation is fine (but not spectacular) and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between. Apparently \"Home On The Range\" was meant to be released before \"Brother Bear\" but because of story issues it was delayed. I don\u0027t think it should have been made in the first place. It has also ruined the work laid out by \"Brother Bear\" for a new Disney renaissance. I think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired, because not only is it terrible, but it ended mainstream 2-D animation for Disney, a massive loss to the entertainment industry.\n\nThe DVD has an audio commentary (with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster). There is also a behind the scenes featurette, games, art review and music video- more than this movie that never should have happened deserves.\n",
    "\n   I\u0027m a fan of Audrey Hepburn and this movie relys heavily - too heavily on her charm.  And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial.  Now, if you\u0027ve read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static.\n   Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self.  This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better.  There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here.  This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead.  Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop.  (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I\u0027m all ready laughing!)\n   Before I hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles.  For that, it is adequate.\n   The remake, ALEX AND EMMA suffers very much from the same problems.  They actually improved the script, and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices, but both films seem to have suffered from \"settling for a star\" when a less mainstream, more zany actress was needed.  OK, this doesn\u0027t stink...it has Audrey, but it certainly doesn\u0027t sizzle\n",

I agree that perhaps it is targeted to some older kids, but that leaves a void for the younger ones.  Why do the characters have HUGE, unnatural feet and arms (not to mention Lani\u0027s breast augmentation)?  Lani now looks like a streetwalker, Taro (my favorite) like a cheap hood, and what happened to Marky?  The themes have turned dark, the behavior (street racing, violence, nastiness) provides an incredibly poor example.  A movie that was very safe and innocuous has turned into a minefield for my children.  I disagree with some reviewers that the kids \"don\u0027t pay attention\" to those parts...we will not let our kids watch this trash!  My kids and their parents are mystified at why such a good thing was allowed to go so far down.  We told them it is rated PG (I agree with that reviewer) and they might watch it when they are older.

I left the film feeling robbed, disappointed, sad, and a bit unfulfilled.  I viewed it only once and then sold it on e-bay at a cut-rate price.\n\nDo yourself a favor and save your time and money\n",
    "\nWhat a disappointment!  Every time it gets hot, it cuts straight to the end.  The movie is entirely foreplay!! \n",
    "\nWhile I have not purchased this box set I have seen many of the episiodes several times as I am a fan of Spongebob allthough he and Patrick can be a bit pathetic at times. For example, in \"The Idiot Box\" when they order a TV just to play in the box. Anywhyey as someone has said in there reviews some dummy snipped out \"Just One\" bit of the episiode \"Just One Bite\" which is my personal favorite spongebob episiode because of the music as well as the humor. You all know it so there\u0027s no need for explanation. I think it\u0027s so pathetic that certain scene\u0027s in cartoons have to be snipped out\n",

    "\nI bought this movie without seeing it first and have now watch it at least two times through. Some chapters, I watch several more times.\n\nThis movie has three things against it. First, I was very disappointed with the number of product placements in this movie. It takes alot away from the whole movie. Second, it has too much of the same stuff that can be seen in any recently released WM movie. Same people doing the same exact things. Third, the sound track was way below par.\n\nI\u0027m still a Warren Miller fan and the movie does have some good ski footage. But, I don\u0027t think the WM bunch went out of their way to make this a good ski movie.\n",
    "\nDon\u0027t bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like I did.   The earlier ARTISAN release is still much better than this special edition.   The image is better and ALSO the sound.   I don\u0027t know what Lions gate thought they were doing, but remastered? no.   I compared both several times before writing this even though I only had to compare once.   Might as well wait for a HD DVD to come out, this is a waste unless you want the additional features\n",

This time round, the government realise there\u0027s nothing they can do to stop Jason and have him captured.  He is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm.  Unfortunatley, he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space! Yes space!  The budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good.  There may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it\u0027s just not enough! This sequel sounds more like a Star Trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good Friday the 13th flick.  Supposedly, a TWELFTH Friday the 13th movie is being made (if you count the excellent Freddy Vs Jason).  While Freddy Vs Jason was indeed impressive, there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore\n",

    "\nLet me break it down for you in a nutshell, people. It\u0027s a murder mystery in which the film\u0027s protaganist thinks she knows who the killer is. But, she has her doubts. But she saw a tatto of a spade on the guy\u0027s arm. He has the same thing. But what does she do? She has sex with him. Sex, sex, and more sex. If you suspect somebody of being a killer than why on earth would you have sex with him? Plus, 50% of the movie is just plain old sex and sex talk. I don\u0027t think this was a perfectly planned movie, to tell you the truth. \n\nFinal Verdict: It\u0027s easily forgetable and needs to go right before it starts\n",
    "\nAlright: take a step back, and tell me there isn\u0027t something decidedly wrong, even militantly spooky, about the American Southwest. \n\nYou know what I\u0027m talking about? No? Let me clarify, then.\n\nWe\u0027re driving, Me \u0026 Thee, across some barren stretch of ancient Arizona moonscape, and we\u0027ve hit upon what I call the Magic Hour: when the Day is laying down its sword in honor of Old Man Night, and the setting sun is really firing up all those sleeping reds and oranges and deep, feral yellows, up on the rocks, the hills, the cliffs, the crags, the bluffs. \n\nCan you see it? Can you hear the coyotes keening and wailing and hi-yi-kee-yi-ing away back up in some box canyon, where those black-rooted stunty trees wave their straggly, evil, twisted arms towards an absentee Heaven? \n\nWe still think of America as a young country, and maybe that\u0027s just our innocence talking. Because this land is just as ancient as any trod by the African or Chinese, and can\u0027t you just smell the Terrible Old Blood-Secrets buried down under the Earth when you\u0027re out on the high desert?\n\nSure. As the town of Desperation\u0027s former Sheriff (former, in that he\u0027s going through something of a---ah, Midlife Crisis) would say, Gosh, yes. \n\nThe guts and sheer, pulpy, bloody visceral glory of Stephen King\u0027s novel \"Desperation\" rides that seam of ancient, buried, hulking horror like a 40-something housewife saddling up the mechanical bull at Gilley\u0027s, and that\u0027s half its charm---which is why I was expecting so much with Mick Garris\u0027s cinematic version, and, no doubt, why I was just so damned disappointed. \n\nThe setup, the build, the execution---everything about \"Desperation\" cuts thematically close to the territory King marked with his bad-doggie tale \"Cujo\". Remember \"Cujo\"? Something ancient and unspeakably evil, and deeply stupid and hungry---something nasty lies all coiled-up in a dark cave.Until Cujo---big, bumbling, naive, benevolent---comes lumbering into its domain. \n\nAnd gets eaten. Devoured. Turned into a shambling, rabid hulk of its former lovable slobbery self, transformed into a ravenous engine of death with one single design: to spread carnage, red and raw and toothy, across the trembling land. \n\nNow, just as the arc and trajectory of the bullet isn\u0027t all that mindful of its casing, so too the unsleeping Ancient Evils of Cujo and Desperation aren\u0027t too picky about their corporeal hosts. Whether it\u0027s a 300-pound dog or a 300-pound lawman, the only real concern is where to pile the bodies. \n\nOr so you\u0027d think. Sadly, \"Desperation\" is a tiny little bang, and a ton of whimper: 15 minutes of shivery brilliance, and what feels like about 8 hours of unbridled dullness. \n\nThat bristling tale of ancient, sleeping, hungry Evil---Tak ripped out of his slumber with the explosion of the charges in the Rattlesnake Pit, and his unquenchable desire to eat his way out into the guts of the little town of Desperation---all of the novel\u0027s frantic hardscrabble fight against a mounting, relentless Evil is wasted by Mick Garris\u0027s listless, uninspired direction. \n\nIt\u0027s as if Garris burned up his budget hiring Ron Perlman to run the numbers as Collie Entragian, and then outsourced the rest of the flick to Bangalore. Hell, they even dragoon some worn-out mountain lion to take a chunk out of flabby old Charles Durning\u0027s patooshka, and even that doesn\u0027t jack up the Excite-O-Meter on this miserable thing. \n\nNot that I\u0027m complaining about Perlman: this sad little flick bumps and grinds and gets its Crawling Kingsnake groove-on *only* when Entragian is on the screen, and Perlman is the perfect choice as the Lawman who goes all Economy on us and squeezes both Good Cop *and* Bad Cop into one body, then goes on to Downsize his jurisdiction. With extreme prejudice. Tak! \n\n\"Desperation\" has its 15 minutes of brilliance with that fatal traffic stop: everything is just about note perfect. Those lying, impossibly high wild-blue Western skies; the Trooper lurching out of his cruiser, that Gary Cooper drawl just crackling out over the silence of the High Desert, the spike of Dread at the curt command to step out of the car succeeded by a queasy flood of relief when---thank God!---it\u0027s just a busted-tail-light. \n\nIt\u0027s here, in the seconds before \"Desperation\" lurches forward zombie-style into B-grade horror, that the movie succeeds, that it creeps and crawls the way the book did. It is here that the film conjures up the loneliness of the Vast Stretches, the realization---something most American suburbanites go to their graves without knowing---that there are wild spaces on this crazy planet where you could be murdered and buried without anyone knowing how, or why. \n\nWhile the coyotes howl, the scorpions scuttle and clatter, the black widows stalk and spin and move itchingly towards their prey.\n\nGosh, yes. \n\nJS\n",
    "\nSo I thought I only saw pieces of the ABC presentation of Desperation. On TV I thought I missed the chapter about the first family, David\u0027s family, and how they came to be in the town jail. It turns out I didn\u0027t miss anything, that\u0027s the way it was filmed. When I heard the film was available on DVD and \"R\" rated, too, I vowed to rent it and see the movie as it was designed to be seen. Curses, gore, adult scares and, perhaps a booby! One wouldn\u0027t expect anything but the most watered down presentation on ABC but the \"R\" rated version, oh boy!\n\nThe DVD, rated \"R\", was EXACTLY the same presentation word for word and scene for scene with the only difference being the exclusion of commercials. I\u0027m going to say, and prove me wrong, that the \"R\" rating was slapped on the DVD to intice people to rent it to see the original adult version. What a sneaky rip-off. How can they do that?\n\nOverall, the movie was not great. The ending was completely tacked on and I got a little tired of the sermonizing. The performances were OK, with the exception of Ron Perlman\u0027s performance. He was outstanding.\n\nI know Amazon sells this DVD but they also sell the book and the book is much more satisfying. It\u0027s hard to believe the same guy that wrote the movie also wrote the book. I\u0027m sure everybody made lots of money on this project but I\u0027d like my money back\n",
    "\nThis review might contain some spoilers....I was disappointed with this anime. After all the reviews I read I was expecting alot more.

    "\nWe bought several different potty training videos and this was, unexpectedly, the worst. The reason: It lacks focus.  It comes off as more of a production made by people who never had kids, or at least don\u0027t remember what potty training is all about.\n\nIt goes back and forth between Elmo and short film and animated clips that focus on independence and doing things for yourself.  But it doesn\u0027t really hold a 2 year old\u0027s interest and the song lyrics and such are overly complicated for a child of that age. My older daughter, who\u0027s potty trained for years now, watched it more than my son who grew bored really fast.\n\nIf you are going for entertainment, get this DVD, but if you want your little one to start giving up diapers, go with Potty Power\n",

    "\nPeter Sellers as well as Peter O\u0027Toole and all the beautiful women: Capucine, Romy Schneider, etc, make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60\u0027s. Was really that world that mad? Of course! You couldn\u0027t stand life without a psychonalist. Thus, the film reflects precisey that. The lack of self-confidence, the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade, till -happy ending, of course- O\u0027Toole and Schneider get married and lived happily everafter. And everybody has surpassed their personal crises. Good for the movie. The humour is just wonderful. I recommend it most enthusiasticall\n",
    "\nThe year: 1965. The cast: Peter Sellers. Peter O\u0027Toole. Woody Allen. Ursula Andress. The soundtrack: Burt Bacharach. Tom Jones. Dionne Warwick. Manfred Mann. The movie: Believe it or not -- terrible. Really... as in unwatchable (other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits.) Painfully unfunny slapstick routines, actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards, and no plot to speak of. Not even fun to watch for 60\u0027s camp value like The Party or Casino Royale... I had to turn it off at about the halfway mark.\nGrade: Incomplete\n\nSafest bet: Get the soundtrack, skip the movie...\n",
    "\nI am a big fan of Woody Allen and I presume that I will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies.  Prior to viewing \"What\u0027s New Pussycat?\", I would have presumed that I would enjoy each and every movie.  However, \"What\u0027s New Pussycat?\" has shown me that even Woody Allen can make a disaster movie.\n\nWhat is wrong with this movie is just about everything.  The acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up.  We start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees.  Peter O\u0027Toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women.  He proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous.  He calls all his femine friends \"pussycat\" which gets old after a while.  He constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather interested/disinterested approach toward his playmates.  He seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by Peter Sellers.  Sellers does his best with what little he has to work with.  He has the Dr. Strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times.  Woody Allen wrote the script, which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture.  I once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3.  With Woody Allen, the comedian said, you can use all 10.  In \"What\u0027s New Pussycat?\", I wish there HAD been at least three good jokes.  This overlong look into the problems that O\u0027Toole\u0027s character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of Bennie Hill-style slapstick.  I take that back; there\u0027s no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of Bennie Hill by associating it with this turkey.  Anyway, the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of O\u0027Toole\u0027s mistresses.  An incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring go-kart track.  (Presumeably all fashional French Chateaus have a conveniently adjacent go-kart track).  This enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind.  After all, we have some top talent in Allen, Sellers and O\u0027toole and we see them spontaneously go go-kart-riding off into the sunset (or the side of a building, or a mud puddle, or something meant to be funny).  I was glad to be done with the movie.\n\nWoody Allen is a great talent.  Peter Sellers was a great talent.  Peter O\u0027Toole was a great talent.  Watch them in their other productions but spare yourself the one movie that each one of them should not have made\n",

    "\nThroughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor\u0027s music \"self-indulgent bullsh**\" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes\u0027 summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke\u0027s death. Reminds me of the Republisuck\u0027s \"Fair and Balanced\" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain\u0027t in a museum.

    "\nDon\u0027t bother trying to watch this terrible mini series.  It is a six hour bore, an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other.  There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance.  It is a dry, boring, drawn out, and uninspired as they come.  The writing is atrocious, and while the actors should be given credit for not choking on the swill they have for dialogue, they are completely unbelievable.  The story is utterly predictable, though it goes off on pointless tangents and ignores potentially interesting subplots, and the only thing surprising is that anybody ever thought it would be a good idea to make this drivel.  It doesn\u0027t even meet the expected level of technical proficiency, with terrible editing, pathetic sound, and blatant continuity problems.  Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile.  The BBC has made many better mini series, and pretty much any one of them would be preferable\n",
    "\nNext to A Night At the Roxbury (another Will Ferrell zero) this is the worst movie I\u0027ve ever seen. So maudlin and it dragged on and on and on. It could actually make the viewer pray for death to end the torture so I guess it has some authenticity. Brad Pitt\u0027s particularly bad - one facial expression (blank) and a painful monotone delivery. I think he got some award aptly represented by a carved WOODEN statue of Keanu Reeves. Mr. Brangelina Jolie looks awful next to a brilliant thespian like Anthony Hopkins. Bottom line: this movie stinks and so (ironically) does Pitt\n",
    "\n\u0026quot;Metropolis\u0026quot;,Fritz Lang\u0027s 1927 silent masterpiece,is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one! But over the years,this film has been reedited,recut,and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker.Since its stay on the Public Domain shelf,the prints and image quality have over the years been poor.I DO NOT recommend the following versions:1.the Goodtimes Video release has poor image quality and even worse,NO MUSICAL SCORE! 2.The now-notorious Madacy DVD, which is about 5 times as worse as the Goodtimes video release,contains horrible,blurry image quality,freeze-frame opening titles,and an annoying musical score! Just recently,TCM (Turner Classic Movies) has broadcast the brand-new,beautifully restored 2002 restoration of \u0026quot;Metropolis\u0026quot; which I taped off of and trust me,it\u0027s well worth it! Buy the Kino restored version on either VHS or DVD,but DO NOT buy the horrible Public Domain versions which can definitely rip you off! A Terrific film and thanks to Kino for making this restored version a definite must-see! I also recommend the 1984 rerelease by Giorgio Moroder (which is now unfortunately out-of-print)and buy the soundtrack to go with it\n",
    "\nCan someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered DVD version of this film with Chinese audio and English subtitles?  The recent Hong Kong Legends release is crazy: Chinese audio, or English audio, but NO English subtitles!  \n\nI have the original Chinese language/English subtitled (the subtitles are imbedded) version of this movie on a Universe VCD and, based on the merits of its available Chinese audio/English subtitles alone, it is a better movie--by magnitudes--than the one(s) commercially available to the (hapless) U.S. market.  \n\nThe English dubbing on this DVD, even though well synchronized with the actors\u0027 lips, takes so much away from the film nevertheless, especially its \"Chinese-ness,\" which is a major reason I enjoy this movie genre.  Take, for example, the scene where our hero first returns to Jing Woo School after learning of his master\u0027s death and sees First Senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master.  After handily defeating the challenger, First Senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the English soundtrack completely (and deplorably) misses.  Also, at the very end of the U.S. release film, Chen says he is going back to his Japanese girlfriend.  In the original, Hong Kong release, he actually goes off to fight the Japanese with the resistance movement.  Between these two examples, there are many such, gross audio mis-cues; enough, at least, to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film: the best of Jet Li\u0027s filmography, and perhaps the best of the \"modern\" Martial Arts genre, period.\n\nThe same criticism holds true for Jet Li\u0027s The Tai Chi Master (released in the U.S. as the English-dubbed Twin Warriors).  It\u0027s an English soundtrack superimposed over a Chinese movie, often stripping the film of its unique cultural content/identity/nuance, forcing the film through an American \"knock-down-shoot-\u0027em-up\" template and reducing the potential for mental (as opposed to strictly visceral) enjoyment to a pitiful minimum.  We end up with a film typically devoid of humor, character development and silver screen \"intimacy,\" a film precariously out of balance with, and far flung from, its careful directorial intent.\n\nIf you value the full content--visible and audible--of Chinese martial arts films, but lack facility in the host language, then the next best thing is a well-subtitled, original language version.  And this release clearly is not that--by a long, long, long shot.\n \n",
    "\nIf you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting.  Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent.  Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go.  The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has.  Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange.\n\nBy the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall?  This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease\n",

    "\nOf course the Criterion Collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer. The problem is the film itself.\n\nPreston Sturges made some genuinely profound films such as The Lady Eve, Unfaithfully Yours, and Hail the Conquering Hero that are rich and complex experiences. But Sullivan\u0027s Travels is   simplistic, pretentious, and false.\n\nAs the film\u0027s characters themselves point out, poverty is only intersting to the rich, whose view of it is distorted. Odd-faced character actors in dingy sets make a rich man\u0027s view of poverty and not at all related to the real thing. Sturges was one of the most highly-paid men in America, so his view of the subject matter is (like characters say in the film) based on cliche.\n\nThe climax with its chain-gang laughing at a cartoon, is pretty dopey and a fairly unconvincing argument for comedy. Sturges would do better to point to how comedy in his best films allows him to examine self-deception, angry love, role playing and a host of other themes--in other words how humor gets into the darkest and most ambigous areas of human life that \"serious\" drama cannot so easily reach.\n\nThis film is exactly the kind of film that Sullivan wants to make--which is why it is so overearnest and uninteresting.  \n\nIf you want to see the genious of Preston Sturges, watch any of his other films (even Harold Diddlebock) in their entirety. After the first 10 minutes a simplemindedness takes over Sullivan\u0027s Travels that make makes it a dispiriting film.\n\n",
    "\nI love Stargate, and give the movie 5 stars. I own a VHS copy, and have watched it many times.\n\nWith that said this \"Ultimate Edition\" is not ultimate at all.

This documentary has nothing to do with the cast/crew/design/production of the movie. This does not, by any means, make this DVD ultimate.

Actually, I\u0027ve seen vhs copies with better audio/video quality.  If I had not purchased the set from Amazon itself I would have thought, I did get a cheap bootleg. The sound is a bit flat, which I could deal get over, but the picture quality is just horrendous! All of the episodes are grainy, pixilated, and some even blur a bit. There are whole episodes where the show is so dark you can hardly tell what is going on. It\u0027s a waste of money to buy dvd\u0027s like this. Shame on Fox for releasing them this bad!\n\nAs for the show itself, well, it would be kind to say it was okay. In truth, it is not that great. I wonder how the show made it to season two at all. The acting was bad, the dialog was atrocious, the stories were subpar; I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Usually, a shows first season is the best or at the least good enough to make you want to see the next run, but not this one.\n\nIn short, DO NOT buy this set even if you are a fan. You can tape reruns on the FX channel in better quality!\n",

But so what? It\u0027s still boring. We just sort of drift around from moment to moment, through what seem to be virtually unscripted scenes, backwards through the \"story,\" which has pretty much no focus or ultimate impact. Then it\u0027s over and you get to do something more interesting, like shine the silverware. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I like dark and disturbing films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, anyone?), but I prefer them to at least be interesting and involving.

The rape scene is violent, with graphic language.  Obviously actual penetration is achieved (anal)...but none shown.  Not even a good boob shot.

    "\nPeter Segal\u0027s \"Anger Management\" is a film with nothing going for it.  It is best described as boring, annoying, and devoid of laughs.\n\nMild-mannered Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding.  He immediately develops a problematic relationship with Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the self-help expert leading the sessions.  As the two men spend more and more time together, Buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling.   \n\n\"Anger Management\" just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like.  It is essentially a one-joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly.  Sandler and Nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker.  Furthermore, the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings.  Truth be told, \"Anger Management\" is one of those projects that was green-lighted because of the talent involved and not because of its quality. \n",

    "\nRobert Groden suggests that the Zapruder film of the Kennedy Assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of Kennedy.  In my opinion, his \"evidence\" is shaky at best.  Groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who \"really\" shot Kennedy, and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by ABC, CBS, and many books.  Groden needs to finally realize that the Kennedy assassination has been solved definitively, and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money cash-cow alive.  \n\nDon\u0027t draw a conclusion based on this DVD!  Look at other sources listed below and then draw your conclusion:\n\n1.  ABC\u0027s Peter Jennings presentation of the Kennedy Assassination (available on Amazon.com) clearly shows that Oswald was the one and only killer of JFK.\n2.  CBS\u0027s Dan Rather\u0027s special program on the Kennedy Assassination (available on CBS website) also suggests that the preponderence of the evidence points to Oswald as the lone killer.  \n3.  The book \"Case Closed\", by Gerald Posner.  He uses the physical evidence collected in Dallas, logic, and his ability to see through the fallicies of the conspiracies to show that Lee Oswald is the lone assassin.  \n4.  The book \"Marina and Lee\", by Priscilla Johnson McMillian.  This book shows that Oswald was certainly capable of the assassination, and the circumstances of his life point to the conclusion that he killed Kennedy.  \n\nMy advice is to watch this DVD first, and then look at the sources I list above, and then make an intelligent conclusion.  If you are like me, you will see that Groden really has nothing solid to stand on.  \n\nJim \"KOnedog\" Konedog, Kennedy Assassination Stuudent\n\n\n",

    "\nPLEASE do NOT waste your time or money on this much-hyped piece of trash.  Not only is Harvey Walden unconvincing in his role as drill sargeant, he lacks passion as is evident by the body language and expressions of the exercisers in the video.  Unlike other excercise gurus, he does not exercise WITH you, instead he stands on the sidelines and barks out commands. The production quality is very low budget.  It looks like it was shot using a  camcorder. The set is bland and melancholy, and THERE IS NO MUSIC! All you hear is the loud marching of the feet of the exercisers, who display NO enthusiasm at all.  And, I for one, can\u0027t blame them.  I only hope they got paid for what must have been an extremely painful project for them. I was never more bored in my life.

    "\nThe only thing worse than seeing this movie is the fact that it plays automatically all over again when it\u0027s over. This is a glorified music video of horrible music. Jim Carey should not be on the cover of this movie either, as he is in about 15 to 20% of the whole thing. They should have had whoever the musical artist was. I honestly don\u0027t even know the plot of this movie, and I\u0027m not kidding. I laughed so hard out loud ... when I had to read the back of the DVD case to remember what it was supposed to be about. The sound? They interlaced two songs (one in your right speaker, one in your left) that don\u0027t even match. If you want an idea for a good movie, read the back of this DVD case, and follow that plot, as the director sure steered clear of it. Alan Thicke ... I thought I knew ye!

It\u0027s SO funny!\" blah blah blah ... then, they get mad after they lose an hour of their life, but have no problem passing it around to others and doing the same to them\n",
    "\nThe acting was stiff and vapid, the filming was grainy and amateurish, the story was non-existent. A good Rx for insomnia, this forgettable piece of rubbish has only one redeeming quality: Seeing young Jim Carey trying to make the most of a boring script and insipid role\n",
    "\nPoor Lindsay Lohan - it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life, she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off.  As an actress, she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft.  As a child actress, she was a natural fit for her spate of Disney appearances, with FREAKY FRIDAY her crowning achievment.  However, as a young adult, the pressure is much higher, as is the bar of success.  And movies like this are NOT helping.\n\nBut to be fair, one cannot place the blame on Ms. Lohan.  The fact is, she has already had a turn in a non-Disney role which paid off exquisitely.  MEAN GIRLS offered us the first glimpse of Lindsay in a post-Disney world.  The timing was on, the interaction with the cast was superb, and everything just fell into place.  But then again, that film also benefitted from a knockout script by a knockout writer (Tina Fey).  JUST MY LUCK has NONE of these things going for it.\n\nPerhaps ironically, Ms. Lohan\u0027s latest vehicle is quite an unlucky choice for her.  We have a promising premise in the concept of a boy and girl with opposing luck.  Lohan is lucky, Chris Pine is not.  Inevitably through the courses of movie magic, we know that the two will end up trading places (much like Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd once did in . . . what was the name of that movie again?)  The only mystery for the viewer is whether this will occur through a wise old Asian or a wise old Gypsy. (Spoiler - it\u0027s the gypsy! OK, I know, I shouldn\u0027t be giving these things away!)  Like I said, we all know this is going to happen.  What we DIDN\u0027T know was that it was going to take THIRTY-FIVE minutes to get there!  So, we kill one full third of the movie being bombarded with example after example of Lohan\u0027s good luck and Pine\u0027s bad luck.  By the time they make the switch, I had already lost interest and was planning my lunch.\n\nAfter the predictable bout of sudden bad luck, Lohan learns that an ill-timed kiss with Mr. Pine was what caused the change of fortune.  Problem is, the kiss was at a masquerade party, and she doesn\u0027t know whom she kissed.  What follows is perhaps the film\u0027s only somewhat enjoyable sequence as Lohan tracks down and ambushes 20 strangers with sudden and embarassingly public kisses trying to get her luck back. \n\nSadly, this brief bright spot ends too quickly, and it is back to the formula as Lohan and Pine meet and fall in love anyway, not knowing that they are the ones who caused each other\u0027s luck to change.  If predictable hook-ups make you happy, you might find some charm in this final third of the film - that is if you can overlook the sudden need for Lohan\u0027s best friend to become a song-writer in what was obviously a \"what do we do with the final act?\" tacked-on storyline with positively no set-up beforehand.\n\nThe problem with this film is that it comes across as very \"slapped-together\" (To borrow from Mad TV, it was \"JUST MADE IN TEN DAYS).  Is the director to blame?  While Donald Petrie has a few hits to his name (MISS CONGENIALTY, GRUMPY OLD MEN, and MYSTIC PIZZA) he also has more than a few duds (THE ASSOCIATE, WELCOME TO MOOSEPORT, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN).  \n\nOr perhaps it is the writing team?  To date, the two credited writers have yet to muster up a single true hit, and one gets the sense that a more competent writing team would have taken a better direction with the plot and have not wasted the obvious talent that Ms. Lohan does in fact possess.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen the producers take a risk and make Lohan a much more loathsome character to begin with than she is.  Her character comes off as too nice to hate, and yet too shallow to root for.  \n\nWhoever is to blame, this is clearly a sub-par effort at best, and one I hope Lindsay (or her casting agent) will learn from.  With four movies coming down the pike, she still has a shot at transitioning into a much more serious career.  I like that she has taken smaller ensemble roles recently (such as PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION and BOBBY).  A very smart play on her part.  Let\u0027s hope she can steer clear of JUST MY LUCK roles for awhile\n",

    "\nEvery once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor/actress in it that everything will turn out good. Blue Steel is one of those movies. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties (or should I say murders) which she did not commit. Sounds like an interesting plot, right? It would be had the script not been so poorly written. The supporting actors give such a bland/typical performance that not even Jamie Lee could have saved the dialogue. Aside from the acting, the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises. Some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop (Jamie Lee) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her. So why do I give Blue Steel an extra star? Well, I\u0027ll just say that if you are a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television. Just don\u0027t pay over $3 to rent it and certainly don\u0027t buy it\n",

    "\nDeath Tunnel began with promise. Early in the movie we were treated to some unique visuals, wonderful music, and a good feel. Them the actors opened their mouths and Death Tunnel fell apart.\n\nDeath Tunnel is the story of 5 college girls who, seeking an initiation into a party clique, are picked into a hazing ceremony which leads them to an old hospital where white plague victims were slaughtered. The building holds much more than they suspect, including angry (and dull!) ghosts. From here the madness ensues and the blood flows.\n\nDeath Tunnel drags after the first 30 minutes, and holds few frights. The story gets dull once the girls are trapped, for nothing really happens other than 45 minutes of filming tricks. During this time we are tortured with an abundance of horrible acting; some of the worst in an horror film I have seen this year. The acting leaves you scratching your head, wondering how any film studio will give a director/producer $2 million to make Death Tunnel and allow them to squander the money on junk talent.\n\nAnd in the end, that is what kills Death Tunnel: pitiful acting.

    "\nKiefer Sutherland stars in `Dead Heat\u0027 a crime drama in which the star of hit TV series `24\u0027 can show more tender side of the character than he is often associated with. He plays Pally, 35-year-old Boston cop who is forced to retire because of the heart problem, and his acting is very good. Overall, however, there is not much that I can recommend in `Dead Heat\u0027 except some nice touch in showing the characters. The film tries to include as many things as possible, but few of them really materialize. \n\nThe story looks rather like a familiar one. Because of his early retirement, Pally starts to drink, and even thinks of committing suicide. His relationship with his estranged wife Charlotte (Rhada Mitchell) is not going well and he is not happy to know that she is now going out with someone else. \n\nBut Charlotte is also nice and caring, so she persuades Pally\u0027s brother Ray (Anthony LaPaglia) to visit him. Ray, who is accused of not being a law-abiding citizen by his too earnest brother, has a good plan to make money easily, and offers it to Pally. It is about buying a racehorse cheap, he says, and it is an easy job because he happens to know that the horse, which has not win any races recently, is actually misdiagnosed, only suffering from a polyp a small operation can remove. \n\nWhen everything is going well, things get suddenly complicated because of a gambling-addicted jockey Tony (Lothaire Bluteau). From here, the story snowballs into blackmail, caper and even murder, but the film\u0027s overall tone is always light, not taking itself very seriously. \n\nUnfortunately, for all their effective acting from Sutherland, LaPaglia, Mitchell, and Bluteau, the weak and unsure direction totally fails to give momentum to the otherwise unremarkable film. It is not funny when it tries to make us funny, and it is not romantic when it tries to be romantic. Feeble direction simply misses several good opportunities to make good use of the jockey\u0027s sullen little daughter Sam (Kay Panabaker, her feature debut), who could have been a little surprise (or gem) in this unconvincing plot.\n\nIt is true that Kiefer Sutherland shows in `Dead Heat\u0027 another side of acting talent, which is less eccentric and intense than most of the roles he had played, or he would play.

Even the low budget film \u0027Barabas\u0027 with Anthony Quinn had better direction than this worthless film.  The screenplay is contrived, the script is worthless, and the acting utterly shallow from everyone on this film: at least \u0027The Robe\u0027 had Richard Burton.  Victor Mature continues to act as if he just came out of a cocktail lounge after a few martinis too many.  Jay Robinson continues his idiotic and ridiculous performance of Caligula as if the character were a retarded bufoon instead of the diabolical genius of cruelty and perversion (See Hurt\u0027s performance in the BBC\u0027s \u0027I, Claudius\u0027 to see how a good actor handles this character.)

I\u0027m not being unpatriotic or anything, I\u0027m just saying why this new show is so weak.  Also, I noticed that once the translators of the original show started figuring out the show was a huge hit, they ruined their own voiceacting by being all self concious.  The original few seasons of the first \"Iron Chef\" are where it\u0027s at!  Once again, I don\u0027t watch this show for the cooking, I watch it for the odd, bizarre translations and cheesy voiceacting\n",
    "\nDo not confuse this with the Real thing. i found teh VHS of this for $1 at a store near me. I was interested so i got it. I watch Iron Chef on the Food Network evey night, and this dosent even begin to hold a candle to it! The one commentator is a failed comedian, and the other is a culinary half wit!I never heard more ussless facts in a 90min span b4 in my life. The chefs in the first baattle were, for lack of a better term dissrespectful, i mean come on how are you gonna have a cell phone on you and answer it During a Cooking battle?!? They kept cutting away from the cooking to show interview clips with the chefs. The Cooks were pretty good, they had a decent talent but we didnt get to see as much of it here as you do on the real show. There Flour reporter keeps bugging them thru out the whole thing, asking questionspassed down from the dumb announcer.They kept tryign to play shatner off as a culinary genius but come on we all know that he is nothing but a medeocore actor....out side of star trek or wat ever he was on. The only you see shatner is when he is talking about clearly prewritten statements that sound kinda incoherant lol. All in all i give this 2 stars, and that purely gose ot the merit of the chefs, not to the shows them selfs. Unless your a shatner Fanatic, or sone won thats just kinnda like \"its cooking, I\u0027ll watch it\" but be warned. Its not as good as it could be. Glad i only spen $1 on it bc its truely not worth more\n",
    "\nYou know, Shrek 2 is the embarassment of American culture. What\u0027s wrong with it you ask? Let\u0027s see... too much slapstick humor, too many movie references, or parodies, and an unforgiving act of making fun of or parodying CLASSIC DISNEY CHARACTERS!!! That\u0027s just unbelievable, Dreamworks! Disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry, and you just make fun of them. That\u0027s a real shame. You should be thanking Disney for all what animation offers nowadays. Disney classics have heart, humor, and a beautiful story. Shrek 2 lacks that. Shrek 2 deserves to be taken away from everybody and stored in a government facility, never to be seen again!!\n",

Remember the scene where the head of FEMA risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire. As Hurricane Katrinia proves, there is no such thing as a bureaucratic, administrator hero! Instead, this movie comes off as a piece of not-so-subtle Federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time\n",

After awhile I clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary... nothing. They don\u0027t even tell you where they are?! It\u0027s basically a 45 minute music video. And the music, although I like it, doesn\u0027t fit with the footage at all. I really don\u0027t understand the point of this project. I watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding. Total waste of time and money. And I am a Jack Johnson fan\n",

In reading other reviews it appears that there is a much better VHS version and I would recommend that over this.  Do not be fooled like I was with the fine condition of Welles\u0027 \u0026quot;The Trial\u0026quot; by Laser Light or the pipe smoking picture packaging of this.

    "\nThe Award winning documentary Freestyle, looks like something fresh, creative, and new from the exterior. I was psyched to purchase this DVD the minute I heard about it. \n\nWhat a let down!\n\nFirst of all, How did Freestyle achieve all of the acclaim and all of these film festival awards, Secondly who picked it as a winner? Probably some cornball who isn\u0027t familiar with the culture or good off the dome MCing?\nThis documentary tries really hard to connect to the audience and present the validity of rhyming off the dome but falls completely flat. The film isn\u0027t balanced enough to a certain degree. What you basically have is nothing more than a bunch of tree huggin backpackers spitting nothing but junk and 10 syllable words off the top of their heads for a majority of the film. Don\u0027t get me wrong there are some credible scenes in Freestyle with Mos Def, Biggie, Black Thought, J.U.I.C.E, and the Last Poets....but not enough.  Freestyle tries to come off as some profound documentary but sheds very little light to the subject and the questions that many Hip-Hop heads have asked for years. Why wasn\u0027t the current trend of fake freestyles (writtens coming off as freestyles) addressed more? Why weren\u0027t more credible MC\u0027s exposed and quality underground MC\u0027s presented? Why is there a section entitled \"written/freestyles\", what kind of oxymoron is that? It makes no sense. Why is there a section on Freestyle DJing??? What???!!!? Isn\u0027t that called turntabalism??? It seems as if they\u0027re fishing for more topics that ultimately don\u0027t have much of a direct relation to rhyming off the top. Is there a freestyle graffiti section too???\nFreestlye continuously fails and derails itself off track from the key subject, the art of freestyling. At times it tries to be a Hip Hop 101 DVD. Most of the people who will be purchasing the DVD are already familiar with Hip Hop\u0027s roots in the South Bronx. Where is the quality freestyling at? Ultimately, \"Freestyle\" is over-saturated with un-proven, extremely weak, amateur MC\u0027s who need to focus more on spitting quality off the dome freestyles.\nThey cover Supernatural\u0027s sorry a$$ for almost half of the entire DVD, which is very unfortunate. I admire his creativity, but he sounds terrible. It\u0027s no wonder why he can\u0027t get signed. He thinks his doo-doo doesn\u0027t stink, because he\u0027s studied the dictionary to help expand his vocabulary for freestyling, but yet he can\u0027t take the time to concentrate on getting out of the broom closet that he lives in.\nI thought that this film could have benefited from more footage of proven vets who can truly freestyle such as Kool Keith, Tribe, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-1, Snoop, Kurrupt, Common, Safir, Likwit Crew, Redman, or anyone from Hieroglyphics. These aforementioned artists can \"really\" freestyle. That would have faired much better than watching these tofu eatin, incense burnin, soy milk drinkin, poetry night geeks struggle to put words together. The Eminem rap Olympics footage from 1997 would have been great too.\nUltimately, if you are somewhat/vaguely familiar with Hip-Hop culture or a new fan of the underground scene, then you will love Freestyle.\nIf you consider your self a long-time fan of Hip Hop culture and familiar with the topic of freestyle rhyming then you will be somewhat disappointed, just like I was.\n If you want a quality Hip Hop DVD purchase check out \"The MC\", \"Scratch\" or \"Hip Hop Immortals\" take my word for it. I\u0027m rating this with 2.5 stars mainly for the rare footage of artists such as Kool Moe Dee, Bahamadia, Biggie Smalls,  The Roots, Craig G, and Kool Herc\n\n\n\n\n",

She\u0027s really more IDIOTIC, that Chaotic.. she\u0027s got this princess in distress act that only her die hard fans can\u0027t see through.. I saw her in concert once, yeh I admit it.

Her vocals were horrible, and it was so bad when MTV picked it up and they were obviously doctored.. she has absolutely no talent whatsoever.. and her vision is incredibly lacking... Her bland personality and complete naiivity and idiotic behavior makes itself evident in this show that isn\u0027t even bareable for a minute... \nI\u0027d rather drag myself through Glitter, or Madonna\u0027s latest Tour Doc than sit through a single episode of IDIOTIC. \n\nI\u0027m not a Jessica Simpson fan really..

A long life of knowing he\u0027s got a girl friend he can\u0027t touch, see, or speak with.\n\nI find this movie depressing. Hepburn chooses the stifling life of a princess for the \"honor\", instead of following the man she loves and running down that empty corridor screaming out his name as he walks out at the end, having chucked the whole royal kit-and-kabootle for her man. \n\nPeck choose poverty instead of instant journalistic fame? Albert takes one for his buddy and is now stuck doing endless pin-up photos in his dank drab loft? \n\nI mean really people. Would you like to live with the staff at the palace? Endless \"League of Nations\" speeches, and all the time wondering what the man of your dreams is doing? I\u0027m sure she\u0027d face the fate of Lady Di trying to escape her monotonous life. And to think she may even risk marrying someone like Prince Charles, a stiff approved of by her entourage. Depressing. \n\nPeck is forever seeing what could have been as no one believes a word of what he says when he finally comes out with the truth on his deathbed. And the only source he has is the former pin-up photographer down the hall in the rest home, the one who constantly mutters at the ceiling, \"my photos coulda been a contenda\" while taking pictures of nurses with his 1950 pinhole camera, the one without film they let him keep for patient management sake.\n\nDepressing. \n\nWe should have heard a \"WAIT\" as Peck walks out of the last frame. Audrey running, her tiara falling to the marble floor, shoes flying off, holding her dress as the entire press corp chases after the both of them. They jump into the river again. Eddie, knowing she\u0027d break, waits in a scooter and off they go into the roman sunset for a TRUE ROMAN HOLIDAY.\n\nBut NOOOOOOOOOOO.....\n",

The FX are so bargain-basement, however, and the plotting so loose, that the film loses direction and winds uup just going through the motions in the last half-hour after a rather promising set-up. Zach Galligan must have been really hungry for work when he chose to do this movie.\n\nThe menu is basic, and the only extras are trailers for Infested, Anaconda, and the Creature Features series.\n\nI like the wit.

As for the storyline, well I found it extremely uneven with some parts of the movie excruciatingly slow and others quite good. \n\nThe Positive: Lee Horsley is surprisingly engaging as the vagabound, warrior Prince Talon and Kathleen Beller is breathtaking as Princess Alana, she\u0027s never looked better. The film is worth at least one watch just to see Kathleen in her prime. There are also numerous other very lovely ladies (such as Anna Bjorn) in this production that will keep all the young male viewers interest peaked.\n\nCast includes; Richard Moll, George Maharis, Richard Lynch, Simon McCorkindale and Robert Tessier, one of the great tough guys in film\n",

There was good cinematography and music, and Kevin Bacon is always appealing, but that\u0027s the best I can say.  Oh, and the nun.  She was pretty good too.  The lead black man was also engaging; the problem was really the script.  Too pat, and too many unbelievable things that screamed \"Hollywood\".  Like when the village burned down.  They were ready to just up and leave where they\u0027d lived for generations.  As if it takes generations to rebuild their houses.

It\u0027s so silly it unintentionally wanders into John Waters territory several times.  The thing is, James Woods acts like he\u0027s on coke before his character starts doing coke, so when he actually starts the coke binge, the movie enters a hyperreal realm of ridiculousness.  Still, it has its moments, such as Sean Young falling down a flight of stairs and having a miscarriage, or Woods explaining that cocaine \"just takes your natural energy and amplifies it\".  A good title would be \"National Lampoon\u0027s Cautionary Cocaine Tale of the 1980s\"\n",

    "\nAntonio Banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you can\u0027t believe he ever got wealthy when he\u0027s running around giving money freely to a woman (Angelina Jolie) who lied to him from the moment they met.  She didn\u0027t want him to be blinded by a pretty girl, so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry.  Well, we never get to see the pretty girl, because Jolie must have killed her too.  The only reason this woman is \"hot\" is because she\u0027ll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody (if you\u0027ve seen Gia, you\u0027ll know what I mean).  Neither she or Banderas (who isn\u0027t a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent) have any chemistry, and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her.  My guess?  The age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed, and all the sex in this movie gets old fast.  It\u0027s so stupid, because nobody has interludes like that unless they\u0027re shooting a blue movie.  The only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot.\n\nYou can see right through this silly waste of two hours you\u0027ll never get back:  this adaptation from Waltz into Darkness was remade especially for the purpose of exploiting two celebrities with highly sensual images and nothing more.  This movie is as bad as Showgirls and one star less than Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, because at least Beyond is badly funny in an entertaining way.  Not only is their relationship devoid of any true sense of love, but you also get this overwhelming desire to see creepy, unconvincing Billy (played horribly by Thomas Jane) get the girl.  Billy?  What a stupid name for a bad guy, but I guess it wouldn\u0027t make a difference even if his name was Ralph or Percival.\n\nEarly on in the movie, the so-called beauty Julia/Bonnie/I forget what else--wants to see a really bad theater group, and a friend of theirs comments on what a cheap mellowdrama is being presented.  My thoughts about Original Sin exactly.  The plot is stupid, and the dialogue is so bad it\u0027s over the top.  In the end, the movie makes absolutely no sense, and you wish you would get a payoff, but you don\u0027t.  The rat poison doesn\u0027t do its job, and neither does the executioner.  All I really am sure of is that, with all the rape scenes that Jolie\u0027s horrible character seems to enjoy and her portrayal of a woman who\u0027s asking for it constantly, that women should find this movie grossly offensive and degrading to our gender, and I\u0027m not even a feminist!  As for studmuffin Banderas?  He really has no business in front of a camera because his acting scope is on par with the little boy who was in Problem Child with John Ritter.  However, he is a good director (Crazy in Alabama).  Heed my advice and avoid Original Sin; the two hours you waste on it will be unforgivable.    \n",
    "\nCan someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered DVD version of this film with Chinese audio and English subtitles?  The recent Hong Kong Legends release is crazy: Chinese audio, or English audio, but NO English subtitles!  \n\nI have the original Chinese language/English subtitled (the subtitles are imbedded) version of this movie on a Universe VCD and, based on the merits of its available Chinese audio/English subtitles alone, it is a better movie--by magnitudes--than the one(s) commercially available to the (hapless) U.S. market.  \n\nThe English dubbing on this DVD, even though well synchronized with the actors\u0027 lips, takes so much away from the film nevertheless, especially its \"Chinese-ness,\" which is a major reason I enjoy this movie genre.  Take, for example, the scene where our hero first returns to Jing Woo School after learning of his master\u0027s death and sees First Senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master.  After handily defeating the challenger, First Senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the English soundtrack completely (and deplorably) misses.  Also, at the very end of the U.S. release film, Chen says he is going back to his Japanese girlfriend.  In the original, Hong Kong release, he actually goes off to fight the Japanese with the resistance movement.  Between these two examples, there are many such, gross audio mis-cues; enough, at least, to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film: the best of Jet Li\u0027s filmography, and perhaps the best of the \"modern\" Martial Arts genre, period.\n\nThe same criticism holds true for Jet Li\u0027s The Tai Chi Master (released in the U.S. as the English-dubbed Twin Warriors).  It\u0027s an English soundtrack superimposed over a Chinese movie, often stripping the film of its unique cultural content/identity/nuance, forcing the film through an American \"knock-down-shoot-\u0027em-up\" template and reducing the potential for mental (as opposed to strictly visceral) enjoyment to a pitiful minimum.  We end up with a film typically devoid of humor, character development and silver screen \"intimacy,\" a film precariously out of balance with, and far flung from, its careful directorial intent.\n\nIf you value the full content--visible and audible--of Chinese martial arts films, but lack facility in the host language, then the next best thing is a well-subtitled, original language version.  And this release clearly is not that--by a long, long, long shot.\n \n",

If your into purchasing s*** like that then I guess this is for you. I advise you to cop this movie somewhere else\n",
    "\nI just finished re-reading the book; it is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same for the BBC series. For one, the musical score is either absent or irritating. So much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the Characters. How about voice-overs or something else (music?)? Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov (the main character) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book. What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film. I\u0027ve written much more but it\u0027s unfortunately been truncated. Simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book. This is a dreary protrayal.\n",
    "\nI thought that this movie would be pretty interesting. The previews for it made it seem like it was funny. I however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid.

It\u0027s an ugly place where nobody acts human, preferring to cling to stale stereotypes. A place where writers without talent set their stories. A place they grew up watching on American TV and in films, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle. This film is set in that world. No human being has ever been to this place, because it only exists in the minds of hacks. \n\nFrom the writer and director who brought us BROADCAST NEWS, which I reviewed recently. It, too, was in the pretend world, but that was okay because it was a film about a TV show and it had a bit of wit and perception. This has none of either. \n\nIt\u0027s a damn shame this is the only way Cloris Leachman can get work.\n",

    "\nDate Movie should be shown non-stop to all captured Al Qaeda prisoners - only mass-murdering terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish.  Let me be perfectly clear about this: Date Movie may be the worst movie ever made; it\u0027s certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of.  You may cry, you may scream, you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film, but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here - not once.  It doesn\u0027t matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks.  The only thing I got out of this movie was an awful headache.  If you ask me, everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years - if not for life.  Had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to Date Movie, he would have stayed in the ocean.  \n\nWhatever happened to that sweet and charming girl we came to know during the first couple of years of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  Why and how did it ever come to this: Alyson Hannigan humiliating herself in such raunchy, tasteless, unoriginal drivel?  She can still light up the screen with that smile of hers, and she certainly put a lot into her performance, but I\u0027m embarrassed for her here.  She plays an overweight, very disgusting waitress from a mixed family (boy, is it mixed) who is desperate to find her Prince Charming.  After convincing Hitch (Tony Cox) to help her find love, she\u0027s given a complete overhaul (literally), plunked down into a reality dating show, and actually finds a man.  We watch them go through the dating stage, the meet the in-laws stage, and the wedding stage, encountering a number of obstacles to their future happiness.  Really, though, the story is unimportant; all the script cares about are stereotypes, clich�s, toilet humor, and things that make you go yuck.  There\u0027s no joke too hackneyed, no visual too disgusting, and no dialogue too stupid to throw in the mix.  \n\nI\u0027m generally a fan of dumb comedies and ridiculous spoofs, but this mess doesn\u0027t even qualify for the genre.  Date Movie is so utterly atrocious that you can\u0027t even laugh at it.  It\u0027s a complete and utter failure in every way possible\n",
    "\nDate Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie, apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter. A few chuckles here and there but that\u0027s all. \n\nDate Movie is a spoof of romantic comedies. Simply that idea sounds good right? The writers had alot to work with, but they failed miserably. Alyson Hannigan plays the main character, Julia Jones. Personally, not a big fan of her comedy. Now, Eddie Griffin, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop. \n\nThis might be enjoyed by some, but only a few. For me, a big comedy fan, it was pretty bad in general. \n\nI actually watched it at the theaters and, my friends, it was the biggest waste of ten dollars in my life! It is now out on dvd and someone will have to pay me to watch it again...Ok maybe not pay me but at least pay for the movie.\n\nOne measly star * \n\n\n",
    "\nDon\u0027t get me wrong : I\u0027m a fierce anti-communist. But the stupidity of this movie is just unbearable. All the american clichs about Russians and USSR are reunited here, and it should be studied at school as an example of gross caricature. The ridiculous russian language imitations, the dissenters presented as \"freedom soldiers\", whereas a child knows today they NEVER used violence as a mean to achieve their goals, the Jews presented as traitors (the scientist\u0027s wife looks like Ethel Rosenberg) the idea of stealing so easily such a weapon, the reaction of Secretary general (and not Premier), to send another Firefox, whereas he could just use this incident to accuse the United States of stealing... If you should see an intelligent Cold War movie, check out White Nights (it\u0027s a shame it isn\u0027t on DVD yet) or the 7th Protocol, far more intelligent than this gross, highly unprobable childish parody. The chase \"Star Wars like\" scene is WAY too long and looks dated today. Clint Eastwood, shame on you\n",

    "\nWatching this movie, I am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible, and make it drag out on the screen.  The disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds.  Watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be, and how poor direction, and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness.  I won\u0027t even go into historical inaccuracies, or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early.

This is just beyond unwatchable.  Even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old, and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds;  It just grates on your nerves until you\u0027re about ready to shove the DVD through the paper shredder. \n",

    "\nThe last time I saw the names \"Adam Goldberg\" and \"Giovanni Ribisi\" together, they were two American Soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain Private Ryan.\n\nGoldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long.  At times towards the end I was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to \"Memento\" or something of that nature.  What this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels, that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution.  Some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning.  Despite a stellar cast that besides Rabisi also features Jason Lee, Christina Ricci, Vince Vaughn, Haylie Duff and Elvis Costello, it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey.\n\nRabisi stars as Gray Evans, a movie star actor who is having marital trouble.  Gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set, going through fan email, and getting bugged by people, that a fan is stalking him.  Relentless in his obsession of this belief, he starts obsessing about others around him.  Great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales.  We understand that Gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time, of being the stalker, but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring.  The ideas are there, I just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all.  The sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing, and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat.\n\nIf you like Independent films, or want to try something different, by all means give it a try.

Other than that, all they basically show are lame \"hometown profiles\" which last about 60 seconds each.  You get better content from a \"Behind the Music\" or \"Driven\" episode.   There\u0027s even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Britney, Justin, or Christina.  Lame, lame, lame, and disappointing.

    "\n This line, spoken by Julie Christie to Dirk Bogarde in \"Darling\" just about sums up my feelings towards this movie. Although I am halfway done with this movie I think this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen and I am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where Christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing. I am done with this movie (believe it or not) and it only got worse: Christie\u0027s character Diana Scott marries an Italian man who hello, is old enough to be father! And oh yes, he\u0027s an aging prince (in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to Grace Kelly and what would happen to Jacqueline Kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her \"Princess Diana\" almost made me laugh). That nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my TV (a la Elvis Presley) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in \"Georgy Girl\" and that is spoiled British girl living in Swinging England marries older man (Three words: Anna Nicole Smith). Also, I would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that Christie deserved the Oscar for Best Actress? She didn\u0027t at all because it should (and I mean SHOULD) of gone to Julie Andrews for \"The Sound of Music\" (my pick for the best movie of the 1960\u0027s) because not only did she overtake her performance of \"Mary Poppins,\" for which she won the Oscar, she pulverized every performance by a female that year including Christie. And there\u0027s a problem with the Academy: They can\u0027t seem to pull the trigger in giving back-to-back Oscars to the same person.\n I\u0027m not alone in this arugment: In Danny Perry\u0027s book \"Alternate Oscars\" he picks Andrews for Best Actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the AMPAS gave the Oscar to Christie was not because it was \u0027The British Invasion,\u0027 but they saw it as a way to give an Oscar to Christie\u0027s other film \"Doctor Zhivago\" which was T.S.O.M.\u0027s rival and added to the fact that \"Zhivago\" had no acting nominations. There\u0027s another Oscar problem: They don\u0027t know when to be hip.\n Also, does it seem like Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey were the two worst actors in film history? Because it seems to me that every movie that I have seen with them are bad; weather it was this movie, or \"The Manchurian Candidate\" with Harvey, or \"Modesty Blaise\" with Bogarde.\n In conclusion, I think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an Oscar. Or as what Bogarde said to Christie: (a fitting way to close this review since that I end where it begins) \"I don\u0027t take taxis that are filled with whores!\n",

    "\nOn the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama.\n\nUnderneath, however, the director seems to have a couple of other themes going. One thing that stood out to me is that the film is full of people who are \"caught between a rock and a hard place\". Right from the start, where Childers has to choose between following the rules of war or saving his best friend. He has a similar choice on the wall in Yemin - fire into the crowd or let the attack on his people continue. I think he knew at that moment that his career was in the crapper. Jones\u0027 character said as much during the trial: \"Whatever happens here, this man will never command marines again\". The \"bad guy\" national security advisor was in a bind: do what is best for America\u0027s interests or back up the colonel? The ambassador had to make a hard choice: lie on the stand or lose his job, his status, his reputation? Even his wife had to decide whether to tell the truth or stand behind her husband\u0027s story. Biggs, the prosecutor, got caught up in it - he started out with the intent to prosecute what he was convinced was a legitimate case, then got tossed a \u0027hot potato\u0027 by the NSA right in open court. Childers\u0027 second-in-command, Captain Lee, had to decide whether to tell the truth or back his colonel. And so on.\n\nThe court-martial itself seems to pit logic against emotion (shades of Star Trek!). The differences are clearest in the closing arguements - Biggs is the Joe Friday \"just the facts\" type; he presents the panel with A. this happened, then B this happened, and so on.  Hayes\u0027 whole arguement is based on emotion - and then, finally, the jury is left with yet another hard decision.\n\nI found the movie very interesting in terms of what is going on with the characters - a lot of films are like this, if you look a little deeper, there\u0027s more there than the surface story.  \n\n\n",
    "\nFirst off I do not dislike Adam Sandler, I rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film, not so much because I like raunchy antics, but because of the underlying message.  Adam Sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this.  You can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting, farting etc, but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him, he is loyal to his fans and to his friends.  Ever notice how he always gives jobs to Rob Schneider and Dana Carvey?  No one else does, that\u0027s a good friend, also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich, evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films.  He never sinks to there level either, perhaps that is why ECN was such a creepy, deeply disturbing film, I cannot, in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies,what was he thinking?  Early on in the film his character, a drunken loser, belches very loudly in a Chinese restaurant \" Ok I go take shower now\" says Chinese waiter.  I wanted to take a shower too, very soon after that scene.  For starters Mr. Sandler seems to  think he is a voice over man, he is not.  His idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard.  One can barely understand he is trying to do a character, and he barely is.  Also he is the voice of at least four of his characters, he is equally bad in each.  Perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house, he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something, he coaches the kids basketball team, he has been for years, and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him, he is simply there to be lovable, and put upon, he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face (as is the so-called humor here).  The script calls for Sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end, there is no real motivation for his bazaar, cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them.  He starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures, a menorah and a Christmas thing, I forget what it was.  He is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one, but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence, he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink, I can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads, surly, even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book.  Not here.  Of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go.  The film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous, mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a Japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms.  He goes to the basketball game and insults the children, ridiculing one boy for being fat, the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants \"nice kitty kitty\" he squeaks, what the???? then an angry father gets on Sandlers bad side (his only side) and is force fed a jock strap \"I hope you like them extra sweaty\" Ho Ho Ho.  For the next part of the film which seems like eight days, crazy or otherwise, his house is burned, he pushes his benefactor down a hill, in a porta potty which freezes feces on him, he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him, on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth.  We are treated to this twice.  God bless us, every one.  By the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs, each worse then the last, fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad  \"If I move my bowls without using the spray....that\u0027s a technical foul\" is one of few lines I remember, thank you God.  By reading this one might assume, as I did, that  this is irreverent in the good way, poking fun at old Christmas standards, but it is not.  It is disgusting, badly written, annoying and very, very cruel.  The two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly, for no good reason with no motivation or payoff, the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand, this is not always a bad thing.  Of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk, a childhood trauma involving a car crash on Hanukkah, he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after.  The same cannot be said for the audience.  Why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate, who is the audience?  There are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place, the over all feel of the film is one of depressed Sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness.  Adam Sandler has been loyal to his friends, his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was, even if it hurt his feelings.  This Christmas turkey won\u0027t even work as leftovers.  Bah Humbug\n",
    "\nI bought this DVD because Amy Jo Johnsen is in it. (One of my favorite actresses.) What I expected was a decent vampire movie, with some blood and guts, and a good storyline. What I got was a movie with TALKING, TALKING and more talking, and a boring storyline. I saw hardly any action, hardly any fun, and hardly anything interesting. I was extremely disappointed in Amy for starring in such a boring, unintriguing movie. The only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between Seth and Viki\u0027s ex. It was about an hour and fifteen minutes of explanations, and useless talking.\nIf you are looking for a movie with some action and fun, look elsewhere.\nAs much as I hate to put an Amy Jo movie down, I am doing so.\n",
    "\n\tAlthough \"deleted scenes\" are promised on the back cover of the box, there are no deleted scenes on the DVD. Instead there\u0027s a perfunctory \"documentary\" which interviews the cast and other creators, who recite a common litany of how much fun it was to make the film. In this short segment there are a very few informal shots of the players that aren\u0027t in the film, but there are no deleted scenes in the normal usage of the term. Rather disappointing since the cast in audio commentary talks about seemingly dozens of neat scenes that \"hopefully will be in the DVD deleted scenes section.\"\n\tAlso, although the box promises \"2.35 wide screen,\" the film is pan-and-scan and only slightly letterboxed at about a 1.85 to 1 ratio. Some of the scenes are annoying because of the missing portion of the image.\n\tAlso, it\u0027s not a gross teen comedy as the box copy suggests, more of a puppy-love romance with the \"four buddies\" comedy stuff as a sidebar. Which makes it potentially better, I guess, but it suffers from a lack of talent, especially in Ventimiglia\u0027s acting and in the writing. Very anemic; not much here. In the key scenes the players just hem and haw, since they\u0027re not given much to say. Kevin Kirkpatrick, in a small part, is way beyond the rest of the cast in acting sophistication. He draws a very perceptive portrait; extremely funny, but not a typical caricature, the most real character in the movie\n",

It also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations\n",

    "\nPicasso is one of the giants in the history of Art and surely THE artistic genious of the 20th Century, but this renders him boring and repetitive. It was done while he was alive, and has him \"painting\" little cartoon-like \"works\" that were done only for this DVD...one...after...the....other ad nauseum.  This is Picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist, not the edgy artist genius of Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon and Guernica.  It looks as if he\u0027s painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work.  I turned it off after 30+ interminable minutes.  Fortunately I rented it on Netflix, which I\u0027d recommend, rather than buying it\n",
    "\nOk, I am trying to redeem myself from low budget movies such as \" Vampire Assassin\" then I run into another bad movie. Lets face it, this movie totally blows.

    "\nThis review is based on the differences between the standard DVD disc and the Superbit version only.  Based on that, I recommend that you save your money and get the standard version.  You\u0027ll get more features, while barely losing any audio or video quality, which is the whole reason for buying a Superbit disc in the first place.  I\u0027ve watched this movie on my 40\" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn\u0027t see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version.  So unless they\u0027re selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I\u0027d recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers\n",
    "\nI saw this in the theatre and tried to fall asleep becuase it was so dull. True story\n",
    "\nSo disappointing. Hardly a dark/noir film, in my opinion. Just a proper Hollywood murder mystery. And there\u0027s no sex, except brief kissing which Lana always cuts short!  I\u0027m a James M Cain fan, and this doesn\u0027t even try to be faithful to his great noir novel. Everyone\u0027s too decent. Cora (Lana) doesn\u0027t have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body, and she\u0027s always costumed like a perfect fashion model, fingernail polish and all.  Frank (Garfield)is never lustful, never mean, never desperate.  Always polite and decent. Not a gas station (except for one pump that looks planted) not a single oil can or wrench.  Not a greasy spoon or diner, Twin Oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or B\u0026B, fit for Donna Reed \u0026 family.  The 80\u0027s Nicholson/Mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark.  Much more faithful to Cain\n",
    "\nI am a big fan of faerietales and stories for children, though I do not have any of my own.  On the whole I am unimpressed with the Barbie series which is highly unoriginal with characters that seem as plastic as the dolls themselves.\n\nWhile it manages to be more of a sedative than a painful experience, it is not something that I would recommend to other lovers of faerietales and/or faerie lore.  \n\nChildren, however, are often attracted to brightly colored things with simple stories, and will most likely love it\n",
    "\nMission:Impossible, the TV series, told the adventures of the Impossible Missions Force -- an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins, foreign dictators, terrorists and others who threatened the security of the United States. Rather than engage in James Bond-like shoot outs, the IMF team worked together to covertly neutralize threats, leaving little or no trace of their involvement. Although the IMF had a leader (Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Peter Graves as Jim Phelps), there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective. A truly groundbreaking show.\n\nAlong comes Brain De Palma\u0027s catastrophe of a remake, starring that couch-jumping Scientologist Tom Cruise. Within half an hour of the film starting, the entire IMF team, save for Cruise, is killed off, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original Mission:Impossible is shot to hell. Granted, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are present as Cruise\u0027s new team, but Mission:Impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another Tom Cruise vehicle where he preens and postures. Making a film called Mission:Impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original TV series. It\u0027s obscene what Tom Cruise\u0027s ego has done to Bruce Geller\u0027s original concept. This is just another action film with Mr. Cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself. See the original TV series and skip this piece of bastardized trash\n",

    "\nThe plot of \"Hard Target\" has been summarized in previous reviews, so I\u0027ll limit myself to discussing my favorite part.\n\"Hard Target\u0027s\" claim to fame when it came out was that it was John Woo\u0027s first American film, and that\u0027s certainly a big deal.  (I just saw \"Hard Boiled\" the other day, and I\u0027d need seven dictionaries to describe that glorious mess.)\nBut it boggles my mind that Lance Henriksen\u0027s jaw-dropping death scene doesn\u0027t land right at the top of every review of this movie. I mean... (spoiler alert) the dude has a grenade dropped into his pants.  He manages to get the grenade *out* of his pants before it explodes.  And then he throws it away from him, right? Wrong!  He UNSCREWS the grenade, hoping to separate the fuse from the explosive.  And he DOES separate them before the grenade goes off and starts laughing in triumph.  But he holds the fuse like two inches from the explosive and... THE SPARK JUMPS ACROSS!  Funny enough already, but L.H. makes this shocked \"Whu...\" sound that is more hysterical than the entire first season of the Daily Show.  Right before blowing up.  It\u0027s absolutely brilliant.     \n",
    "\nAction Director John Woo\u0027s first attempt at making a good American action movie fails with Jean Claude Van Damme (Bloodsport, Sudden Death) on board as the lead hero who jumps over police cars, punches venomous snakes in the head, hops on motorcyles balancing himself on it while he flips over a truck and lands on the ground...kicking a gasoline tank at a guy while he shotgun blasts it and soving a grenade down the pants of evil bad ass Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, The Terminator). Hey, when isnt Henriksen a evil son of a bitatch? Yancy Butler (Drop Zone) is Van Dammes love interest protecting her from the villains trying to kill him and Wilfrod Brimley (TV\u0027S Walker, Texas Ranger) plays Van Damme\u0027s southern fried canjun Uncle who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow while trotting off after his country house blows up. All in all, it doesnt become the worst movie ever made, its only presence if the style John Woo brings to his action scenes...his lingo in the art of which he creates. Also starring Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy and The Mummy Returns) as Henriksen\u0027s right hand man. Ah, gotta love the scene where Van Damme has sexual chemistry with the snake while punching it ou\n",

The animation is almost all old and there are frequent times when the princess look like an animated statue with only their mouths moving, while their prince next to them really does look like a statue since he doesn\u0027t move at all.  \n- The Christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for Halloween than Christmas.  The part where Belle almost drowns (and would have certainly died of hypothermia) is a good example of this, though not the only example.  \nOverall the video is not at all suited for young children\n",

    "\nThis movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity.  The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement.  The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad.  One must think that it even disappointed it\u0027s original German viewers of the 1950\u0027s who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era.  \nAs an anti-war film this film is a failure; as a shoot \u0027em up action war film it is droll.

    "\n Many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn\u0027t fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don\u0027t misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things.\n",

The voice over was also a bit on the annoying side but thats probably the fault of the people who made this.\n\nIts actually very ironic that this being about the worst films is actually a terrible film in itself. Another complaint i have is on what merrits on they ranking these films.  FOr a few, it seemed they put their not cause they were the worst movies made but because they were box office flops. I\u0027m not saying Ishtar or Howard the duck were good movies but they shouldn\u0027t be placed on a list of the worst.  There are alot more terrible films, with acting thats unbelievably bad, mistakes galore, poor lighting, poor directing, poor writing,etc.  These were just bad movies that were flops.  I\u0027m surprised they didn\u0027t throw Heaven\u0027s gate in here if they were doing flops.\n\nSo i don\u0027t get the criteria they were using.  A lot of really terrible movies were excluded too for some reason.  Manos is sadly missing.  Glen or Glenda is alot worse then Plan 9(despite plan 9 having the fame) yet plan 9 got a lower ranking.  \n\nI guess the best thing i can say about this DVD is that they did get a list of some very bad movies.  Robot Monster and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians are amongst the worst movies you\u0027ll ever see.  According to the DVD, only Black Belt Jones is a movie so bad its funny but many (If not all) picked are so bad they are funny.  I didn\u0027t like how they included the movie Troll only because the sequel Troll 2 was so much worse(For heaven\u0027s sake, Troll 2 didn\u0027t even have trolls in it.  it had Goblins.  Thats bad!).\n\nSo, if you guys want to Watch a List of movies with barely any clips of the films that emphasize there baddness, this a film for you.  those of you who don\u0027t, heres a breif list of some of their movies.\n\nSnow WHite and the 3 stooges\nGreetings\nThe frozen Dead\nThey saved Hitler\u0027s brain\nBlack belt Jones\nTNT Jackson\nThe thing with two heads\nHoward the Duck\nBilly the kid vs. Dracula\nBela Legosi meets a brooklyn Gorilla\nStrange Creatures\nBloodsucking freaks\nLeonard pt. 6\nAttack of the crab monsters\nRobot Monster\nSanta Claus Conquers the martians\nTroll\nTrog\nXanadu\nThe Crippled Masters\nI married a Monster from outer space\nTeenage Zombie\nGhost and the invisible Bikini\nFat Spy\nPlan 9 from outer space\nGlen or Glenda\nBride of the monster\nThe mesa of Lost women\nVoodoo Woman\nIshtar\nFrankenstein Conquers the world\nThe Creeping Terror\nThe great Alligator\nHillbillys in a haunted House\nThe incredible melting man\nFirebird 2015Ad\nDracula Vs.

    "\nI found this film accidentially on Amazon and was curious because I know Welles didn\u0027t complete a great deal of films.  His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer.  The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad.  It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn\u0027t tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly.  I did not shell out of the Criterion edition, which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film\n",
    "\nThis is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to \"Angel heart\"). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo \"Delta\" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don\u0027t be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term \"special edition\" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series).\n\nDon\u0027t buy it.\n\nMaybe there\u0027s a better version (I read talk of a \"Critereon\" disc), maybe not. Still, it really isn\u0027t worth (any) money\n",
    "\nI bought Orson Welles Citizen Kane and liked it so I decided to watch other Welles movies. I bought Mr. Arkadin because the DVD is cheap and rated high on IMDB. I should have buyed Touch of Evil instead. The quality of the picture is laughable, sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes. Judging by the picture and sound quality I would say that they used equipment from the 30\u0027s to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years. Welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the European movie industry of the 50\u0027s. Sometimes the picture shake, during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we can\u0027t read everything. The editing is very poor, there are too many scene changes. When I bought this DVD I expected to receive the LaserLight version, instead I got a DVD made by Alpha Video. The case cover is different and there is no supplemental material. He was mastered cheaply on a PC with the SpruceUp DVD Maestro software, that seem to create problems, each time I try to play the disc on my computer the FBI warning message appear and then the disc eject. I didn\u0027t notice any audio syncing problems however. This movie is the perfect candidate for a remake. I give **** for the story and * for the overall quality of the movie\n",
    "\n The Weight of Water (Kathryn Bigelow, 2000)\n\nThis movie should have been a big production-- an adaptation of an Anita Shreve novel directed by Near Dark\u0027s Kathryn Bigelow, starring a handful of big-name actors. So why does it seem like a Lifetime Original Movie(TM) on steroids?\n\nJean Janes (Shadow of the Vampire\u0027s Catherine McCormack) is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the Isles of Shoals in 1873, when Louis Wagner (Rome\u0027s Ciaran Hinds) was convicted of the murders of two women and executed. Jean isn\u0027t sure they got the right person. She and her poet husband Thomas (Sean Penn) set off for the islands on a boat with Thomas\u0027 brother Rich (Josh Lucas, recently of Poseidon) and Rich\u0027s new girlfriend Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley, who went from this right on to film Bedazzled). The interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare, as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else, and the situation on the boat brings Jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime.\n\nIt\u0027s an interesting premise, and from everything I\u0027ve heard it\u0027s carried off quite successfully in the book, which I haven\u0027t read. But oh, it doesn\u0027t work well at all in the film. The links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut; no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way. Most of the actors are wasted here; even the vastly talented McCormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self, while Sarah Polley, whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame, seems as if she\u0027s worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life. About the only actor who\u0027s really effective here is Hinds, who plays his role to the hilt.\n\nIt\u0027s not the worst movie I\u0027ve seen in the past month, but it\u0027s pretty close. *\n",

I asked a younger, French, female friend, who said she found it at least as boring as I did.\n\nThe characters didn\u0027t engage my sympathy.  Nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other, so I didn\u0027t care what happened to them.  Scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity didn\u0027t build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves.  The sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable.\n\nI sat through to the end, thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes.

    "\nTHE BAD\nI can\u0027t say I dislike this item, but I did not like it either. Even though I\u0027m still a novice golfer (score between 95-105) and been playing for about 18 months, I\u0027ve read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other DVDs ...(yes I\u0027m an instruction junky) and I can say that this instrutor (Simon Holmes) misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing, and even though I like how the DVD has a well structured lesson category listing, he does not explain deeply enough on many things.\nThe filming production seems to have a good intention for this DVD, but it lacks camera closeups/slowmotions on the ball, clubhead, ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want\u0027s to explain. I mean with today\u0027s technology on DVD production, this seems to be a cheap one.\n\nTHE GOOD\nHe has very good tips on many subjects that I think they\u0027re transparent for a very beginner.\nIf this is not your first instructional DVD, and just want to gather a new bunch of tips, then buy it. Otherwise a better selection that I can reccomend for a complete golf school DVD, is the Wally Armstrong\u0027s Ultimate Golfing Experience. The set is very cheap because it\u0027s a compilation of old \u002780s and 90\u0027videos from that instructor, and from the 5 DVD\u0027s in the box, you can thrash 2 if you like, but for $17 bucks...HEY!! is worth it!\n\nI hope this helps and saves you some money\n",
    "\n\nUnlike many, I hadn\u0027t seen this film when it first came out.  So it was with much anticipation that I recently sat down to watch it.  Well, it stunk.  What a disappointment.  The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue.  Show \u0027em how it\u0027s done, Leo.  \n\nMichelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited.  Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief.  Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then.  Rutger Hauer is just plain bad.\n\nIn defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations.\n\nOtherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations.\n\n\n",
    "\nVol. 3 marks a new low for Family Guy: A season that started out strong but ended very \"OH my god, I was so shocked by that hahahahaha\". It seems to be riding on it\u0027s laurels, so to speak, and it\u0027s almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny. I don\u0027t like it, and I think it\u0027s been reduced to recent Simpson quality. Meanwhile, the DVD has a few commentaries (I\u0027d like to point out that the competition Simpson DVD\u0027s have commentaries on every episode, same with Futurama...)Some sub-par special features. The biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single-layer, which means four episodes per disc, as opposed to the traditional seven. We only get thirteen episodes of crap, and maybe we should be grateful, but all in all, whatever.\n\nRaoul Duke\n",
    "\nI\u0027ll get this out of the way: I never liked the 80\u0027s slasher films. Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it\u0027s a good kind of laughing for some reason.\n\nJason is in the future in a facility on a planet, except he escapes(of course). Disposing of scientists, including The Fly and Scanners director David Cronenberg, he ends up getting cryogenically frozen, along with another scientist. Flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out, ooh, a nice reward for Jason. As usual he comes to life and does what he does best: kill attractive looking hotties.\n\nYou don\u0027t go to these movies to expect well-written dialogue, character depth or anything, you come for the kills and to tell you the truth, they\u0027re slightly disappointing. Besides one kill, which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface, the kills are kind of been there/done that. It\u0027s basically stab here, impale there, it seems kind of unimaginative. A few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance.\n\nCharacters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are. However, Jason does what I\u0027m starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls. One girl, wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off(off screen) and I\u0027m like \"damn guy, let one cute girl live for once!\". Dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines. A self-deprecating parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced. \"We love premarital sex!\" is so classic, as well as \"it\u0027s okay, he just wanted his machete back!\". Granted they won\u0027t make an AFI list but they made me laugh. \n\nIt\u0027s the kind of movie that you probably weren\u0027t supposed to like: it was ridiculous and dumb but boy did it seem fun. Just wish it was better\n",
    "\nJennifer Love Hewitt needs to fire her manager. I\u0027ve yet to see her in a truly good role. Those terrible Know What You Did Last Summer movies, Garfield, Heartbreakers, If Only, and many others weren\u0027t exactly memorable roles. The Truth About Love doesn\u0027t help bump her in that direction either. Not that I was expecting Oscar-quality when I looked at the back of the box, seeing a picture of her in a leather corset, I wasn\u0027t going off of words to know that I was slightly interested in the movie. I\u0027ve owned it for a few months now, and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and I were in the other room playing games. She kept coming out every 5 minutes, and I could tell that she wasn\u0027t that interested. After giving in and watching it with her, I now wish we had all played Resident Evil 4 instead.\n\nAfter what has to be one of the most annoying \"sweet\" introductions, we learn that a man has mailed a valentine letter to his friend\u0027s wife, Alice, supposedly by accident. Yeah, real smooth. When Alice gets it, she assumes it\u0027s from her husband, Sam, and sends him a hot letter as well. He gets it, thinking it\u0027s from another woman, and the problems ensue. He starts to hide the letter from her, and with that in mind, she tests his loyalty to her. She texts his phone anonymously with some of the dirtiest things Hewitt\u0027s done in recent memory. But as it turns out, Sam does have a mistress, and things get more complicated. You know what? The entire movie\u0027s boring up until 3/4 through. You\u0027re better off just reading the back of the box for the plot summary, then skipping to scene 9 or 10. And that\u0027s one of the cons I had with The Truth About Love- the time it takes to build up to what\u0027s an actually good conclusion with Sam\u0027s Anonymous admirer doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027s worth it at first. But I\u0027ll admit, Alice\u0027s plan to bust Sam was a good one, though she gets a harsh slap of reality once everything\u0027s over.\n\nThe key problem with the movie is probably that it takes place in England, and Jennifer Love Hewitt\u0027s forced to take on one of the worst accents I\u0027ve ever heard. There were a few times when I thought that they hired a voice actor to dub over her lines- it doesn\u0027t sound like her, and mouth movements often don\u0027t match lines. And that\u0027s funny considering the majority of the cast is from the UK. Then comes the unbelievable part about a guy cheating on a woman of Jennifer Love Hewitt\u0027s stature. There\u0027s no way in hell that could ever happen unless the guy is mentally challenged (ie- Carson Daly). The kicker is that Sam\u0027s mistress is a woman who looks to be in her 40s, and pales to Hewitt in any physical category. And how about that Archie guy? He\u0027s in 3 important scenes at most. All the other times we see him involve he and Sam\u0027s court room scenes which I have to say, are some of the most boring attempts at forced humor. In fact, the trial doesn\u0027t even have a connection to the central plot aside from showing that Sam and Archie are friends and partners. Alice\u0027s friend is also a complete hussy, and seems like she didn\u0027t make the cut of being on Sex and the City. Finally, guys, I\u0027m sorry to tell you this, but there are no scenes of nudity here aside from when Alice visits an adult movie store. Though the best we get from Hewitt is her in a corset, it\u0027s only for a few collective seconds. The love scene is kind of laughable too when she\u0027s wearing that ridiculous wig. Even right now, I still have mixed feelings about the movie. Just when something completely stupid happens, something decent does right after it.\n\nThis is some of the worst picture quality I\u0027ve seen in a while. The transfer looks terrible. Even watching it on my HD Monitor, there were tons of errors. Grain, artifacts, and something new. I almost want to call it rippling- many scenes are out of alignment, and we get a watery effect that takes over the entire picture. I can\u0027t explain it in full detail, but more or less, people\u0027s faces and bodies would look all twisted every couple of seconds. It stays for most of the first fifth of the movie, then is only occasional after that. But then there\u0027s blocking and many more problems that make up for it. You\u0027d think with a direct to dvd release, they could at least get something right. The audio fares a little better, but everything\u0027s weird once again. While you can hear the audio just fine, it\u0027s almost too loud at times, and incredibly, all the actors\u0027 lines look like they\u0027re dubbed- especially Jennifer\u0027s. This becomes very obvious halfway through the movie when Archie yells at Sam. The camera is behind Archie so we can see the back of his head talking to Sam, but when he yells, his mouth doesn\u0027t open.\n\nSpecial features? None. Though the box tries to claim that a chapter selection, previews, spanish subtitles, close captioning and Dolby 5.1 are special features, we all know better than to fall for that. At the very least I expected some behind the scenes interviews or something with everyone going on about how great it was to work on a movie bound for failure.\n\nIs there any reason to buy The Truth About Love? Not at all. I guess that phrase \"low expectations lead to better results\" does ring true for it. I just wish the director, writers and actors had put a little more effort into everything. But you know the funny thing? I\u0027ll bet twenty bucks that this thing gets remade in a year or two with A-list actors (sorry Jennifer), and finds success after they rewrite all the boring parts. Even as a date movie, there are many better ones out there. Might I suggest Shaun of the Dead\n",
    "\nWhen buying a product, you expect a little bang for your buck. Unlike its counterpart Family Classics, Action Classics leaves far short of its mark.  Although these movies are old, you expect quality. Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy. You\u0027d think that because they\u0027re on DVD, the quality would be better.

    "\nI do not like the format of the DVD at all.  I had taken several Pilates classes before buying this DVD, but I found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end.  Much of Pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times, so with no reminder of what I should be doing in each pose I felt like I was being cheated out of a workout.  I don\u0027t think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form, so this DVD will be stored away while I learn the specifics of Pilates elsewhere\n",
    "\nA friend and I tried watching this film once again recently, but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant.  From the beginning, when Katharine Hepburn\u0027s character destroys other people\u0027s cars without a care, we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny.  The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant.  But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting.  Grant\u0027s character is an unassertive, spineless person who is easily dominated.  Hepburn\u0027s character is blindly selfish. Who could care what happens to them?  The one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard. \n",
    "\nLet me start off by saying that I am a HUGE MADtv fan and have been for years. It is easily my favorite show of all time. While I loved \"The Complete Season 1\" released in 2004, I think this DVD set is terrible. Why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent, and arguably the worst, seasons makes no sense to me. Of course this does have some classic sketches, impressions and characters on it, such as Debra Wilson\u0027s Oprah and Mo Collins\u0027 Lorraine, but a majority of it is just random. Most of these sketches aren\u0027t some of the better ones. Who picked this list?\n\nOf course I\u0027ll still buy it because I love MADtv, but hopefully in time they\u0027ll go back to releasing complete seasons again. I can watch a better mix of sketches and episodes for free every day on Comedy Central\n",

Phil Lamarr\u0027s impressions of Michael Jackson, Prince? Little Hassan Taylor\u0027s Greatest Hits? Darlene McBride? Vancome Halloween? The \"Wash me\" video parody of Alanis Morissette? \"Lick my baby back behind\" video parody of Britney Spears? The \"Love muffin\" video parody of Mariah Carey? The Bush Cheney rap video parody. The UBS man goes to the video rental shop, etc.? Afropuffs cereal? The early MadTV was a little savage at times but that\u0027s what made it funny. I feel it\u0027s appropriate to issue the best after you\u0027ve put out the complete seasons. Of course maybe there were legal problems. Some of the humor was pretty savage!

As somebody from Michigan, I saw him before he was Mr. Cartier global super star buying skin treatments at Barneys. I\u0027ve never been more disappointed with an artist.\n",
    "\nI went and saw another film as I was so disenchanted with this one. The opening had so little to do with the rest of the film I thought I was watching a preview to another film. I don\u0027t care for spoofs about Catholics and protestants. The Pythons can\u0027t sing or dance (for those on this board who claim their talents are innumerable). I say to the fans of Python: get a life\n",
    "\nUnfortunately they just do not get off the ground.  Python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge. Regrettably they missed the mark on this one. One or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it. \n\nHowever if you like sex, violence, blood, and debauchery, could care less the fact that they have nothing to do with the absent plot, you could find this film interesting.\n",
    "\nNot my type of humor. I think I\u0027m just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining\n",
    "\nI\u0027m sorry folks, but I went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen.  It would be a tremendous understatement to say I was disappointed.   This film is horrible in nearly every respect, but this is the film\u0027s fatal flaw: A \"character study\" is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature.  \n\nThe film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice.  Sorry to bring up the obvious here, but the ONLY thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping.  He would not be pre-occupied with helping defend the police station (he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun); he would not be worried about \"his chances out there\" (remember he\u0027s on death row); he would be concerned only with escaping IMMEDIATELY. \n\nSorry to all you fans of this \"cult classic\", but a movie in this vein must be at least SOMEWHAT realistic to gain my praise.  This one is a mess.\n",
    "\nThis DVD has a very bad image and sound. Altought it is a good movie, I don\u0027t recomend it if you are looking for a Charles Bronson movie for your collection due to its bad reproduction. No menu, no subtitles, no chapter  selection. I wished I did not buy it\n",
    "\nThe Gauntlet may rank as one of Clint Eastwood\u0027s worst movies.  It is so unrealistic and silly I frankly didn\u0027t want to even finish it.  Released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and Dirty Harry movies, it stands out as being a real stinker.\n\nHere Eastwood plays a loser of a cop, Ben Shockley, who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in Las Vegas for a trial.  He\u0027s told it\u0027s a \"nothing witness for a nothing case\" so he thinks it\u0027ll be an easy assignment.  Well, poor Shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness.  It seems some conspiracy is afoot.  The rest of the movie is Shockley, and his female witness, Gus Mally, running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes.  And plot is so ludicrously predictable it\u0027s pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is.\n\nUnless you really, really like Clint Eastwood, this is one to forget.  I\u0027ll bet he wishes he could.\n",
    "\nWhat a rip off! This is my very first bad experience with Amazon. Heck, this is the first time I haven\u0027t been extremely satisfied. \n\nWho in the world would purposely order a PSP disc of ANY movie?????? The heading for this item still incorrectly states that it is a two (2) disc set. It does not mention that it is in some stange format no one in their right mind would buy. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device. Don\u0027t order this\n",
    "\nI had to contact Amazon five times about this item.  I ordered it on 10-1 and it didn\u0027t ship for several weeks.  Then when I check my account, the description had changed to UMD for PSP.  You will not get the DVD if you order this.  I eventually cancelled mine.  Amazon is using the wrong cover art and the wrong disc specs for this title and doesn\u0027t seem too worried about correcting this.  DO NOT ORDER\n",
    "\nI am extremely dissappointed with amazon on this one.  This is not the dvd version of the film.  However, on all the links to it, it says \"DVD\".  When I received the item in the mail, amazon was very ambiguous in helping me with my return, and even told me that they would send the DVD version of the film.  Nonetheless, two days later, I received the same PSP version again.  \n\nGreat movie, it\u0027s in my top ten.  Amazon screwed up on this one\n",
    "\nI was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized.  And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over.  \n\nImagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing \"All though the Year\" from _Elmo Saves Christmas\" among others).  The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage.  \n\nIf you don\u0027t have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars.  If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity.  Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative\n",
    "\nI can\u0027t imagine why Madonna, Janet Jackson, or Michael Jackson\u0027s VMA performances were not included in this DVD.  The most influential artists in videos and performance were excluded.  I don\u0027t understand.  It is a travesty.  I hope MTV releases more of the VMA performances with Madonna, Janet, and Michael.  I\u0027ll buy this one in hopes they will release a really great complilation of VMA performances\n",
    "\nI have to say, this show did not turn me on at all. I like twisted humor and a good puppet show.\nThis, however, didn\u0027t do much of anything. In fact, it aimed at the gutter and worked it\u0027s way down. Very disappointing.\n\nAnd also very low-budget. Looks like something filmed for public-access TV. I\u0027m guessing Canadian Public-Access TV.\n\nSome people might find it funny. I understand some people find Beavis\u0026Butthead funny.  I don\u0027t\n",

    "\nI just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a Hollywood film (The Departed).  I can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie.  After watching this movie I turned to my wife and said, \"This movie would have been great if it would have stared someone/anyone with an ounce of talent!\"  The acting is very affected and self-conscious... understand that\u0027s how Hong Kong mega-stars always act (its a sort of US 1930\u0027s throwback style).  I really, really despise US film remakes - but Martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline.  I would suggest watching the US version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises - not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new-found intrigue.  PS I have not yet seen The Departed, but I am assuming that it is a much better version than this.  HOWEVER... come on America, we have plenty of creative writers out there, can\u0027t we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots\n",
    "\nI love TNG, DS9, and I even quite like a few of the characters in Enterprise. But I HATE Voyager. Why? One simple reason - Janeway. I cant stand her. She makes me want to puke. She has only two personas in the entire 7-year series and she constantly alternates between them, and they are both nauseating. First, vomit-inducing Compassion-face in which she puts on this phony \u0027caring\u0027 face and talks in a \u0027caring\u0027 gentle whisper. Two, tough-chick-face in which she puts on a hard-chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard-chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable. God she nauseates me. The same thing happened with Maggie Thatcher. The one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything. Unlike Kirk, Picard, Sisko and even Archer, Janeway has no charisma at all. Yuck. But shes not the only one, this has got to be the only Star Trek series in which no matter how hard I tried I could never develop any attachment to the characters. They\u0027re all boring. Only Paris has any appeal and even then not much. I watched the first 3 seasons hoping I would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up. Years later I finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years. No. The same old nauseating Janeway, same old boring episodes, spewing over with self-righteousness and endless lectures about human \u0027morality\u0027. And this series is the most mushy, sentimental crap of all the Star Trek series. There is barely an episode that is not cringe-inducing in its emotional mushyness. The only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the \u0027Q2\u0027 episode and that was only because Q was in it (and they even turned that into a morality play), and the very end of \u0027Renaissance Man\u0027 when the Doctor tells Harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded Targ. Good riddance Voyager, and especially good riddance Janeway\n",
    "\nThe book of Acts is a book of power!  Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation.  The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story.  Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars.  Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers.  All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.  \n\nI would not recommend this DVD.  Stick to the Book instead\n",
    "\nThe only other FF material I\u0027ve see is the movie and I didn\u0027t play any of the games yet so I\u0027m not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked. \n The animation was bland and ugly looking. The C.G animation which was produced by GONZO was poor and didn\u0027t blend in at all.  (If you want good works by GONZO check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others).\n The plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12. 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world. There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place. The bad guy(kid??) sends his minions to where they 3 are. The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says \"IT HAS MOVED??\" yells \"SOIL IS MY POWER\" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over.\n That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot.\n This show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what I understand is not a big \"Final Fantasy\" demographic. \n Strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it.\n",
    "\nIf you\u0027re a stoked surfer looking for a thrill, this is \u0026quot;NOT\u0026quot; the video for you. However, if you want a training video on big wave surfing, go ahead. A better video for the stoke would be the classic Endless summer 2. Much more of a better buy. Billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in Odyssey about tow-in surfing, training on watercrafts, and then they get to the surfing. I fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it. I had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing. Nice documentary for Discovery Channel, not for the wired surf enthusiast. So\n",
    "\ni can\u0027t even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it\n",
    "\nThis is your typical film which replaces reality with fantasy. Something liberals like to impose on others. \n\nIt flopped because it just doesn\u0027t have the ring of reality to it. You can have beautiful scenery, some decent actors (except the Ford-Lincoln-Mercury twit with his quasi-permanent ICE CUBE scowl) and then a really stupid storyline, whallah, you get the fantasy liberal worldview. In the movie the evil guys are an ex-militia leader and his band of neo-feudal toughs. The good guys are \"just-wanna-livers\" with their leader being a conman who found his destiny. LOL! Dumb, just plain dumb!\n\nYou realize it is the neo-liberals (no, I\u0027m not pro neo-con either for the record, neo-cons are worse, getting others to do their fighting - cowards they are) who put limits on free speech, have eroded things so bad that I\u0027m afraid a General Bethlehem type guy (minus the lunatic traits obviously) is the only way to fix things. Look to ancient Rome for the answers on this matter.\n\nTo be brief, the \"bad\" guys are liberals and neo-cons and the good guys are yet to make themselves known. This movie is right only in that America will split up and probably fall in some capacity. History shows the way, which our current bio-mass masquerading as humans will not understand nor can do anything about it (too busy playing video games and IM each other).\n\nOne lesson to be learned in the movie is this: might makes right. Here\u0027s another: all is fair in love and war.\n",

The original copyright on the film was not renewed properly with the Library of Congress, so the film is perceived to be public domain, although the music is very much copyrighted and every distributor of this movie is participating in copyright infringement by selling these \"bootlegs\".\n\nThe companies make the money, because they\u0027re selling OTHER people\u0027s property.\n\nThe people who ultimately suffer are YOU, THE CONSUMER, unknowingly buying products of inferior (worse than professional VHS) quality, thinking you\u0027re getting the real thing, because it\u0027s a DVD.\n\nSave your money. Wait until Warner Bros. gives us the real thing\nthing...\n\nAnd by the way, the movie gets 4 stars, it\u0027s the cheapo bootleg DVD that gets 1 star!\n",
    "\nEvery store should have a DVD shredder for movies that suck. Rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away. Adding Darryl Hannah and Denise Richards to an already horrible story line just to sell DVDs is a disgrace. Trying to do 80\u0027s style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more. Maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one. Save your time, money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video.\n",

As such, I can only rate this DVD as two-stars and certainly no stars for Warner\n",
    "\nOur family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe :10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do Play-Doh instead. The plot if poorly contrived, the production value is low, the acting for the most part is awful, and it\u0027s basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age, my son has no interest in. He did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer. But I\u0027m not buying the video for a 12 second clip. Better bets: A Celebration of Me, Grover or Sesame Street: The Street We Live On\n",
    "\nI just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter.  I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that.  It is more like a music video than a story.  The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn\u0027t much.  Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn\u0027t anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn\u0027t buy it.  I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I\u0027m sorry that we did even that.  Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy.  I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were. \n",

Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn\u0027t even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.  \nIn spite of my being a certifiable \"dirty old man\". [:-)    \n",

I was mislead.  I can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie.  In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O\u0027Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past.  The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring.  The \u0027effects\u0027 don\u0027t exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing.  It\u0027s not funny - it is embarassing.  I could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage\n",

The plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous.  Save your money.   Even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive.   There is no humor, no likable characters, not even a decent quote or one liner.   by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion, you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back.   So save yourself disappointment and keep looking, this movie is the biggest bomb, I have stumnbled across in years. \n",
    "\nI have to say I had no expectations going into this movie, I watched it with an open mind, ready for anything. What I got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to Wales, but also made me want to wail for hours because It was a waste of time. I am just confused about the whole thing really, the plot the characters the ending.....I see other reviews on here about how \"creepy\" it was, and I just didn\u0027t feel that. What I felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by Maria Bello (who I have never thought had a face or talent for acting) What they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane, where the dead go, and we can get the dead back if we give something living. The daughter is whisked away like Penelope taken to Hades but with much less interesting results. The mother and father, now have to take care of a displaced spirit child, her haunted freaky father, and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice Ikea blanket for me.  Are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter, goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously na�ve and gullible local folks? (Who worships in an abattoir? C\u0027mon people) none of these folds deserved children, much less a ghost one. So when the mother realizes that she sucks, and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care I didn\u0027t really care, I was thinking the girl was much better off. I was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it, what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father, because her daughter asked her too? Um, maybe what\u0027s wrong in this family is that No one communicates!!!!! Oh, wait, they all flipping know Morse code so that\u0027s enough?!?! There aren\u0027t any genuine scares, and sheep with glowing eyes aren\u0027t scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it. The ending , both of them, didn\u0027t leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together, it felt rushed. I don\u0027t understand Hollywood\u0027s obsession right now with creepy children, it\u0027s an echo of the days of \"the bad seed\" and \"the omen\" but not homage, more like terrible copycats with no \"oomph\". So see this movie If you like Sean Bean, he is the only good thing about it, other than that see it to cheer when Maria Bello hurls herself off a cliff.\n",
    "\n(1) Scarlett O\u0027Hara is the least likable \"heroine\" I\u0027ve ever seen. She has no redeeming qualities.\n(2) We\u0027re supposed to sympathize with the South and feel nostalgia for the good old days when white folks could own black folks?\n(3) This movie is way too long and dull.\n(4) I\u0027m glad they burned Atlanta to the ground.\n(5) There was nothing honorable or respectable about the Old South and the plantation way of the life. The \"gentlemen\" were nothing but racists who thought they were aristocrats because blacks did all their work for them.\n(6) I\u0027d rather watch \"Mandingo\" than this racist garbage any day of the week\n",
    "\nIgnore the blurb on the VHS box, the movie is not about a couple\u0027s hot parties with hip friends, it is about a couple\u0027s awful parties with jerk friends. Now, that might not be a bad thing -- in fact, I think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones -- but the advertising is dishonest.\n\nMuch worse, though, is the the pointless and boring character of the movie, which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic \"friends\" who mostly don\u0027t like each other. While I\u0027ve known cliques that keep getting together despite frictions between some members, it\u0027s inconceivable that these people would keep getting together for these abusive and tedious holiday events. Also, the couples\u0027 relationships, which come and go between these parties, are unexplained and mostly unexplored, as are some individuals\u0027 character changes, and indeed, almost everything that doesn\u0027t happen at the parties themselves\n",

    "\nOthers have already described the movie; so I shall not repeat what has already said.\nDumont makes a movie, somewhat reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s \"road\" movies, in which a couple, gets in a car and drives off, to nowhere in particular. I hated those movies, but at least, in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it. Here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality, have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen, and seem only to be there to move the plot, if there is one, along.\nKatia, the girl, who seems quite psycotic if you ask me, keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever; for instance, she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car, then gets p#$sed at her boyfriend, when he hits one of them. By the time the movie approaches its dismal end, I did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up. \nThe DVD includes a \"Director\u0027s note of intent\" (always a bad sign) A mix of Felliniesque dialog, blended with Sun Tzu; not a good combination. At the end of the \"note of intent\" the director finishes with \"Envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct\"\nWell, instinct will not get you a viewable movie; I don\u0027t think you could make a worse movie, if you were trying to achieve it. It is not the violence or sex, other movies have that but still have some redeeming values, photography, artistic creation. There is no redeeming value in this. Just a waste of the DVD plastic.\n",
    "\nI purchased this video to get ideas for a yoga fusion class that I\u0027m designing. Boy was I dissapointed!\n\nThis film is for spectators and posers, not for serious Yogis. You can barely hear Shiva\u0027s cues over the music. The video is so focused on being \u0027cool\u0027, that it totally fails to instruct, cue, or demonstrate poses. Anyone who has never done yoga would be totally lost.\n\nAnd as for the trance dance....I was not entranced. The problem was that Shiva was very tight and I didn\u0027t get a sense of freedom from her. There was one guy that seemed to be \u0027in the moment\u0027, but for the most part the trance dance was quite silly.\n\nNot a good instructional video. All glitz, no substance\n",

She\u0027s Clark Kent\u0027s interim girlfriend, like a psycho Lori Lemaris (who cares if she tried to slice n\u0027 dice Lana last season and it makes NO sense for Clark to be within 50 miles of her? I don\u0027t). There are two new supporting characters this time, Lois and, erm...Jason. I weep for Jensen Ackles. He\u0027s way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role. The way he takes a dumbly-inserted character like Lana\u0027s New Boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something. Erica Durance as Lois: EASILY the worst actress, and her lines don\u0027t help. I don\u0027t really mind, because Erica LOOKS like Lois, even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese grater-level annoyance. I think Lois would work better if she just STAYED in Metropolis and we saw her only through Chloe. But I guess it\u0027s cheaper to keep her on the regular set. Personally I think it\u0027s a conspiracy to give Allison Mack less screen time. Why doesn\u0027t she get a revealing shower? Bah.\n\n****THINGS THAT MAKE MY BRAIN HURT:****\n1.)  Clark (somehow) becomes a quarterback for the football team. You get to see it for five episodes. What drama. Ok, this is just stupid. He\u0027s CHEATING, OK?? It\u0027s CHEATING. He can\u0027t just switch off his powers when he wants to. Clark\u0027s football career also results in the episode \"Recruit\", which is hazardous to your health.\n2.)  Turns out Lana\u0027s part-witch. I thought she was Native American? Nah, just French. And a CRINGE-worthy villain.\n3.)  PRODUCER: \"Hey, doesn\u0027t this show remind you of Charmed?? WRITER: \"Not really, but great idea!! Lets dress Lois, Lana, and Chloe is corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers!\"\n4.)  If the writers weren\u0027t going to keep Jason around for more than one season, why put him in the credits?? Durr. \n5.)  Jane Seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in TV history. She does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck. Bye.\n6.)  \u0027Jynx\u0027, \u0027Spell\u0027, \u0027Recruit\u0027, \u0027Sacred\u0027, \u0027Spirit\u0027 and \u0027Ageless\u0027. Oh right, and \u0027Forever\u0027. ALL LAME! They make me ashamed to watch the show! Some are so awful I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever watched them more than once. That\u0027s like HALF the dvd set. Bah.\n\nOooohh, I wonder if Clark and Lana are gonna get together this season! Just they like get together and break up EVERY season! I\u0027m on pins and needles!\n\nThe ONLY things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes. Oh yeah, Hey writers, stop ripping off other successful shows and movies! Morons\n",
    "\nFirst off, let me explain why I purchased the AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS DVD in the first place, sight unseen.  One, I was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950\u0027s as I could on DVD, to add to my personal library.  Two, it was the winner of the 1956 Best Picture Oscar (how bad could it be, right?).  And third, it was on sale at my local wholesaler.  So I figured, what the hey, I\u0027ll take a chance.\n\nTalk about a COLOSSAL disappointment.  I\u0027m a huge movie buff.  I\u0027m only 32 years old, but I love all sorts of films and genres from different periods and countries.  I love old black \u0026 white and silent films, and I don\u0027t shy away from foreign films either.  I\u0027m also a huge fan of Warner Brothers\u0027 2-Disc Special Edition DVDs.  I try to keep an open mind about all the films I see, but I just can\u0027t come up with any convincing arguments to either buy or watch this film/DVD.\n\nTo start, there is NO GOOD REASON why this film should be 3 hours long.  It could have very easily been edited down to 2, if not 90 minutes.  There is almost no script to speak of, and what little there is consists of trite exchanges and banter with barely 2 memorable lines of dialogue.  There are endless shots of open seas or country, followed by about 30 seconds of dialogue, followed by EVEN MORE endless footage of different locales.  There is no real drama or comedy going on to drive the film, and the pacing is absolutely DREADFUL... I found myself hitting the \"fast-foward\" button on my remote on more than a few occasions, simply because I knew I wasn\u0027t missing any dialogue and the establishing shots would go on for 1 or 2 minutes STRAIGHT!\n\nSecondly, the entire cast is virtually wasted.  David Niven is always a delight to watch, but is never given a chance to make Fogg truly shine.  He has one demeanor that he holds throughout:  stiff and mannered, with little or no variation.  Cantinflas, who supposedly was one of the highest paid comedians in the world at the time 80 DAYS was produced, gives us little reason to believe how or why he was such a sensation (other than doing his own stunt work).  He\u0027s mildly amusing at best, and his accent is so thick and mumbled that I had to rewind and replay some scenes with the \"subtitle\" button on.  As for the \"noted\" cameos... again, the actors/comedians are given little to do and barely play to their strengths and familiarity.  The only cameo actor who stuck out as having any real performance or impact was the great John Carradine (can\u0027t miss that voice!).\n\nIt\u0027s hard to believe it took THREE different writers to come up with such a frustratingly bland, lifeless and unfunny script (not to mention headscratchingly illogical... when Cantinflas rescues the Shirley MacLaine Princess character, wouldn\u0027t she fall in love with HIM, her actual rescuer, rather than the cool and distant Fogg, who only ordered the rescue?  Talk about a missed opportunity for some genuine comedy!).\n\nAlthough this film obviously has some fans, I wonder if it\u0027s only because of some overriding nostalgia factor, whether it was seeing it for the first time back in 1956 or on TV as a child.  Other than that, I can\u0027t understand how anyone could seriously recommend this film.  Yes, it\u0027s beautifully photographed, and the costumes are great, but THAT\u0027S IT.  I can\u0027t believe that 80 DAYS won the Best Picture Oscar of 1956, a year that also gave us GIANT, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE KING AND I, THE SEARCHERS... hell, even FORBIDDEN PLANET or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS should have won before this overblown moving postcard.\n\nI\u0027m sorry to say that I probably won\u0027t bother watching this film again and will most likely end up reselling my DVD copy (if anyone will take it!).  Certainly my most disappointing DVD purchase EVER.  Don\u0027t say you weren\u0027t warned!\n",
    "\nThis final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way. \n\nWhen the Wayans abandon a project, then you know it is unfunny and over. Just look at the Scary Movie films.\n\nKelly Coffield left because the producers wanted to use Alexandra Wentworth more. A huge mistake! Kelly was hilarious.\n\nSave your money and avoid this stinker season\n",
    "\nWhen shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang. But saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks. Now dont get me wrong, it was funny, I\u0027ll give it that, that\u0027s the only reason it got 2 stars, but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure IN LIVING COLOR wise. So I\u0027d recomend this for the series collectors like me. meaning I have season 1-4 and although I didnt like season 5, I\u0027d feel uncomplete without it\n",
    "\nThis is a wonderful film. Some may say it\u0027s a bit slow paced and perhaps it\u0027s not geared for the MTV generation\u0027s pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it\u0027s rewards for anyone who cares to take a  chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the  director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so  terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It\u0027s a crime that  such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only  hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes\n",
    "\nThe book of Acts is a book of power!  Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation.  The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story.  Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars.  Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers.  All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.  \n\nI would not recommend this DVD.  Stick to the Book instead\n",
    "\nI did watch that and I did not liked cause I know good detailed information about this history. This DVD is making polishing Boeing  company instead Lockheed won this techonology war ! It is 2 hours long and Boeing appears most of the times. There is no good explanation how Lockheed is performed that outstanding job. It all talkes about Boeing and at the final it again declares Boeing bla bla good bla bla succesfull at stealth jobs. I think the director was from Boeing Compan\n",
    "\nI don\u0027t know what to say about this...it was interesting but not wowing by any standards. It was semi-enjoyable to watch with interesting graphics and the concept is novel too. But the music SUCKS and thats half the DVD right there. Recommend renting or borrowing from a friend. I wouldn\u0027t buy this DVD again\n",
    "\nOk,  I\u0027ll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn.  This film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon.  It really doesn\u0027t take a genius to figure out this plot.  I mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room I turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film\u0027s plot and sure enough I was right on the money, only I thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no, it had to keep going and going...just end allready, I get it!\n",
    "\nI am a big fan of martial arts films  --  having lived in Taiwan.  However, this one was over-hyped in my opinion.  The love affairs in the DVD were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times.  I often enjoy the melodrama and over-acting of Chinese films, but I gagged a few times on this one.  It was down-right goofy at times.  I really wanted this one to grab me, but it did not. \n",
    "\nWhile it may be true that the \"camera doesn\u0027t lie,\" when you take 600+ hours of footage and edit them down to 6, you have a lot of leaway to manipulate.  Immediately after finishing the film, I would have given this movie 4 stars.  It\u0027s very well crafted and kept my wife and me fascinated for all eight episodes.  After we finished watching it, however, we wanted to know more, so we started gathering information from other sources.  Very quickly, we discovered that we had been conned.  Jean-Xavier de Lestrade clearly knew what would make a compelling story, and he crafted the footage to tell that story.  Unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t appear to be the real story.  We felt so betrayed.  We\u0027d spent 6 hours watching what was purported to be the truth only to discover that huge amounts of evidence had not been shown (much less explained) and that the documentary clearly was more spin that revelation.  If you want to see a well-made film that will keep you amazed and guessing, definitely see this film.  If you want to see something that reflects reality, I would look elsewhere\n",
    "\nControversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the \"desperate\", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore.\n"

They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I\u0027m buying some now and save myself the frustration\n",

    "\nThe DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one.

I rarely get a decent burn.  More often than not I\u0027ll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it.  My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together.  So disappointing!  Unfortunately I found out too late that Memorex uses CMC media, which only has a 0-50% success rate!  [...\n",

I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this.

If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item.  In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks!  I cancelled the contract immediately.  It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract.  I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss.

Then it got the machine equivalent of \"lockjaw\" and I\u0027ve been unable to get the tray to release.\n\nSo, it\u0027s a good drive while it operates, but I\u0027ll probably make sure I pay for at least a 1-year warranty on my next purchase.\n\nAs far as my recommendation goes, it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one\u0027s drive fails.  Yesterday, I just went to a backup burner and kept working; if I had NEEDED to get the job done, and I had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy, I\u0027d have been in a seething, hair-pulling rage.

    "\nI ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here. BIG MISTAKE. Upon setting everything up, it all worked great for about two hours... then the dreaded \"UNPLUG/PROTECT\" screen came up. Now it won\u0027t turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode. (and no, it\u0027s not a short in the wires or overheating... it protects even when stone cold, and with no speakers plugged in) I called sony and they say it is a short in the box. So now my two options are to unhook everything, repack EXACTLY the way it came to me and reship back to the online store I bought it from (with enormous hastle and expense) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center (which happens to be across town, and only open monday-friday, 9-5pm. So much for being convenient). This thing is brand new and already needs repairs!!\n\nOn top of that, even out of the box, NONE of the video inputs worked. Audio was fine, but video was dead as a doornail, right from the start.\n\nAnd even on top of the fact that this machine CAME broken... it sucks even when it works right! The DVDs take forever to load, and it comes with HDMI out, but NO HDMI IN! So if you\u0027re an HDMI user, I hope you have multiple HDMI inputs on your television... one for your cable box, one for this crappy system.\n\nThis is a piece of junk.

At that appointment, the \"genius\" said he couldn\u0027t fix it, and because he said he didn\u0027t know anything about engineering he couldn\u0027t say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple \"genius\" doesn\u0027t involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The \u0027genius\" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn\u0027t answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.\n\nPerhaps it should be retitled the \"idiot bar.\n",

    "\nHere is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:\n\nWe bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we\u0027d recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we\u0027re not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you\u0027re within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we\u0027ve used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We\u0027re actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I\u0027ll try to post again with the results.\n\nHere is my update, which I wrote November 3:\n\nThis is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing \"the entire internal mechanism\" (I don\u0027t know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it\u0027s now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we\u0027ve been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I\u0027m going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It\u0027s still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won\u0027t. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn\u0027t had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We\u0027re still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.\n\n",
    "\nI would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months.  There is a reason the warranty is only 90 days.  The performance (sound quality) steadily declines over time.  The ihome worked great when it was new, but it won\u0027t play songs from the ipod anymore, and the radio is a static box\n",
    "\nSo when I first got the iHome for Christmas, I loved it. Well, I loved it in spite of the glaring bright light, that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep. However, after awhile the iHome will not register my iPods existence at all. Today I was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again. I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won\u0027t even pick up radio stations. So, the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled. Useless\n",
    "\nWe have had ours for almost a year - it still works great, but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light.  Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it\u0027s on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room!  My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it.  We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio\n",
    "\nI like the features.  I\u0027m satisfied with the sound.  The user interface could be more intuitive.\n\nHOWEVER, my overriding complaint is that the docking port (as many other reviewers have mentioned) is not reliable.  The connection is poorly constructed, so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the iPod isn\u0027t there any more.  If they could fix this quality problem, it would be well worth the $100, but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can\u0027t justify it at any price\n",

The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.\n\nIf they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn\u0027t stress the electronics, I\u0027d give this thing 5 stars.

(I always verify data DVD\u0027s, since errors in those are not ignorable.) But with Memorex, I\u0027ve gotten about 20% failures, including a couple of aborted burns! In one case, the disc had a blank band between two burned ones!\n   The Memorex discs I\u0027m referring to have Manufacturer ID \"CMC MAG, AM3\".

This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night.  \n\nUnfortunately, with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality, the Sony is in all respects inferior; ergonomics, appearance, and above all, FM reception, which is laughably poor.  Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver.  Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn\u0027t noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I\u0027m going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony\n",
    "\nI have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can\u0027t comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC\u0027s popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don\u0027t begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can\u0027t explain why the recurrent failures. I\u0027m frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS\n",
    "\nWhile the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong.  For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off.  Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).  \nThe armband is satisfactory at best - it\u0027s just a standard, no frills, velcro armband\n",
    "\nI was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack. They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won\u0027t supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has. But it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices. It seems to be all right for use in a flashlight. A set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight (a bit dimly) for hours (yeah - I tested it). For the test, I had  charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration (it is not a charger issue).\nI plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs.\nOne last tip - nowadays, the best NiMH batteries are made by Sanyo.

It\u0027s either all Canada or all contiguous US.  This is a major functional flaw if you live near the US/Canada border or live further away and like to take cross-border trips.\n\nOh, and if you do decide to swap out the US map, be sure to save it on your computer first - TomTom doesn\u0027t bother to provide a backup on the CD so if you don\u0027t first make your own backup before changing to the Canadian map you can\u0027t later get the US map back\n",
    "\nThe Tomtom has great features.  But I returned mine.  First, the maps are very dated.  This makes it iffy at best.  It has terrific potential, if it worked.  You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It\u0027s amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it\u0027s internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it\u0027s choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it\u0027s not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.  Hope this is ok.  I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.  The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem.\n\nI don\u0027t recommend this TomTom.  Do research.

    "\nI have owned this little hub for at least a year. I have an older PC which came without USB, so I added a PCI adapter. I soon realized that I needed more ports, and more convenience, than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor.\n\nI shopped around, and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose.\n\nFor a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.)\n\nBut after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various \"drives\" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing.\n\nPlaying with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement.\n\nMost of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad.\n\nIt is of course possible that there\u0027s something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won\u0027t be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I\u0027ve been through, just in case\n",

Reboot. etc.\nIt would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they\u0027re doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort. \nI spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card!\nI am not alone in this experience; see cnet\u0027s web site user reviews of the DWL-G650. \nAnother reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news.\nI give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless. \nBack it goes\n",
    "\nI would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn\u0027t know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn\u0027t come with one and doesn\u0027t say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I\u0027ve been to two radio shacks and online- they don\u0027t carry it.  I\u0027m upset.  Any advice\n",
    "\nI have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that I did.\n\nOr else they wrote their review too soon.\n\nI bought mine in June 2006.  It failed before the store warranty ran out.  One down.  The replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and wouldn\u0027t boot.  Two down.  Sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free RMA.  That one also failed.  Three down.  They replaced it with both a m230 AND a 2GB c150.  The c150 hung after about 2 weeks.  Four down.  I have been using the m230 for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the c150 replacement arrives.  I have gotten quite good at the RMA game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or I get one of those that other people rave about.\n\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ll buy another SanDisk - unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty.\n\nI suggest that everyone with a failed m230 to exercise thier warranty rights.  Sandisk needs to know the true reliability of their products.\n\n",

I wasn\u0027t expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I\u0027m ready turn it on.  I said \u0026quot;it IS ON!!\u0026quot; This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that\u0027s all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that\u0027s not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn\u0027t matter what display format I put it in it just didn\u0027t do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.

It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn\u0027t start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me.

    "\nWe travel quite a bit, both business and pleasure, domestic and international... so the idea of a pocket wireless router was a God send.  We bought this one at the beginning of our annual leave (aka tour the US in a month).  We\u0027d heard good things about the D-Link but with the rebates, this one was practically free.... there was a reason it\u0027s always on sale.  \nIt took forever to set up.  The old firmware is buggy, the new firmware is difficult and touchy to install.  The router itself does not seem to be compatible with most personal cable/DSL modems.  Out of the eight houses we were in, it would only work with one, although it appeared to connect with several others.  It did work with the Ethernet connection of about 70% of the hotels... but that\u0027s not a great average.  It also gets very very hot and than will quit working until it cools down again.  Frustrating.\nAfter the first week we went out and got the pocket D-Link.. excellent- plug it in and it works EVERYWHERE: personal homes, questionable modems, hotels, etc... we have used it from Alabama to Bangkok and everywhere in between.  It\u0027s also about half the size of the Netgear.  Save the hassle and get it first.\n... also a tip, pick up a little usb wi-fi adaptor with your router.

    "\nMy Sangean DT200V pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use.  I kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes.  It worked perfectly on the few occasions when I used it over the 2.5 year period, until yesterday.  The buttons, switches, and display still work perfectly, but only very faint white noise can be heard, whether via speaker or via earphone.  The volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control.  The batteries are new, and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries. \n",
    "\n\n\n\nPerhaps I got a lemon, but I feel wary of buying another DT200V for 2 reasons:\n\n\n1.  From the day I got it, the power button was so sensitive that a tiny waft of air (no kidding) would turn it off (or back on) at whim.  Right in the middle of a song, or talk, this shortly became maddening.\n\nSince this is unacceptable for a $50-range radio; and since I didn\u0027t want to spend as much money mailing it to and fro as it was worth, instead of sending it back -(OH looking back, how I should have!)- I opened it up myself, and had to physically shave down the plastic underside of the on/off button where it touched the internal power switch.  As I couldn\u0027t conversely move the guts further from the button, this was the only solution.\n\nThankfully this worked, and the on/off button did not give me further problems after this.\n\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\n2.  Not many weeks or months of use in, the radio developed this habit of shorting out or something to where my pre-set stations just scanned as blank \u0027fuzz\u0027 (no station, not even \u0027intelligent\u0027 fuzz/crackle like it knew a station existed anywhere on the planet) and I could get zero stations of anything at all--not FM, not AM, and no TV.\n\nThis would happen right after turning the radio on, and I should note that I always used headphones (not the ones supplied; as with most, throw them away, they\u0027re not worth it).  It seemed to me through trial and error that just turning the radio on was fine, but the act of plugging in some headphones joggled some connection or shorted something out, and did this.\n\nI tried several different pair and types of headphones (some with noise cancelling switches, some without, and with these On and Off), and used the \u0027lock\u0027 switch on the radio both in the on and off position while plugging in my headphones (as the company I bought them from recommended turning the lock switch on when changing batteries, to prevent shorts), but nothing I have done has prevented this from eventually happening again...repeatedly.\n\nIt is really annoying when it does, as removing the batteries (which always will lose all your presets, by the way) and waiting several minutes rarely clears the short.\n\nWeirdly, the thing I\u0027ve found which clears the short or re-makes whatever connection is messed up correct itself, is opening up the back (screwdriver required) and kind of pushing the guts (board) one direction or another, kind of scooting it (there\u0027s minimal movement available, though), and saying a little prayer and putting the whole thing back together again.  Most of the time, that has worked.  Occasionally, I\u0027ve had to repeat the process 3-5 times before it will.\n\nSometimes it lasts several weeks before this\u0027ll happen again, other times, it happens multiple times a day.  The day I can\u0027t fix it (I don\u0027t even know what I\u0027m doing that\u0027s fixing it!), I\u0027ll throw it across the room, against a wall, and I probably _won\u0027t_ buy another one.\n(If I do, I\u0027m keeping the receipt, NEVER opening up the back as it voids any warranty, and returning it (not for repairs--for a refund!) the split second it gives me any trouble of any kind.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all this, I grudgingly say that it does have very good reception quality of FM (I almost exclusively listen to this), pulls the stations in nicely, and has very low amount of static.  When one particular station does, it\u0027s usually more the fault of distance, or we\u0027re getting out of range, or the batteries are very low- that\u0027s at fault.\n\nIndoors in a computer-saturated office-cubby environment and not near a window, though, I\u0027d have to say, it has had some significant problems pulling in any more than 3-4 strong-signal stations without major static.  But your office environs may vary.  (Some are more electrical field saturated than most.)\n\nThe FM (musical) sound quality itself is good/decent, and I might say better than many...but my 1 criticism on it is a certain \u0027canniness\u0027 of sound quality (across various headphones I\u0027ve plugged in).  It\u0027s lacking some fullness of the midrange, and warmth.  Also, the bass is not what it could be.  I\u0027m not sure given its overall sound quality signature if the addition of a bass boost button would have helped it or not.\n\nFor me, clarity and volume have helped me ignore some of the lesser aspects of the DT200V\u0027s sound signature.  However, shopping for my next purchase, that will move up higher in importance\n",
    "\nThis has to be the worst keyboard I\u0027ve purchased.  It\u0027s my first wireless.  I\u0027ve used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this.\n\nWith the added snap-on plastic palm rest it sets the base up too high.  Without it there is a \u0027hump\u0027 where your palms go that puts your hands an an uncomfortable angle.\n\nThe plastic is really bad.  It feels really cheap and slick.  \n\nBefore I purchased this I had been trying to get in tough with Logitech about their products and compatability but they never bothered to respond.  \n\nSo, bad product....company on the slide.....doesn\u0027t add up to a good value.  \n\nLogitech used to be the best company out there...or at least one of the best...\n",

I only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so I should be getting a lot more battery life.  I\u0027ve bought other Logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case I wish I had bought another brand. \n",
    "\nNOTE TO EVERYONE WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS CARD--I reformatted it in my camera and it works fine now!!\nInitially I wrote:\nI was very disappointed in the shot-to-shot speed with this card (using a Minolta Xg).  The Panasonic card that came with the camera, which I thought would be cheap, is THREE TIMES FASTER than this \"upgrade\".  This card is useless to me as it cripples the camera I bought it to work in.  It takes FOURTEEN SECONDS from one shot to the next with this card.  With the original card, it\u0027s less than four seconds.  The claim that this is a \"high speed\" card is dishonest.  This is the slowest card I\u0027ve ever used.

    "\n                   \nAfter reading the detailed reports here for how to setup this Linksys gaming adapter unit, everything worked great for several days. I setup the fixed IPs, and all the rest of the settings through the web interface, all seemed well. \n\nNote: I\u0027m a network engineer, so the dual-fixed-ip recommendation [one for each segment] is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances. I suspect the MS game adapter simply performs the DHCP handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup. \n\n\nThen the weird stuff started. \n\nAfter having had this unit turned on for several days, I notice the connection would become slow and not quite as fast as when the Linksys is first turned on. Yet, the XBOX still shows the signal between 48 and 54 Mbps. Strange. \n\nI have reproduced this several times, booting the linksys device, then playing all kinds of games online for hours, running XBMC and playing media through the network perfectly. All is good for several hours, but come back the next day after leaving the Linksys on all day/night, turn on the XBOX, and the network connection is spotty again, but the link details show a full speed connection in the XBOX wireless interface details. \n\nA swift power cycle of the Linksys unit solves the problem immediately, but why should I need to do this? I suspect some NIC buffer is being filled on the Linksys and the power cycle clears out the unit\u0027s network buffers. \n\nIf anyone has figured out what settings to use to keep this thing stable, I am ready to listen, maybe I should select a G-only network and set the speed at 54 or 48 fixed, maybe that will work? \n\nAnyway, I am getting tired of power cycling this thing every day. \n\nGood Luck, \nF. \n",
    "\nI purchased this device to add to my wireless network, which uses a Belkin wireless router.  I had to connect the router directly to the game adapter since it could not be detected by my wireless router.  After configuring it, I could never find it once it was disconnected from the ethernet cable from my wireless router.  I made three attempts at customer service - my first call was disconnected after 20 minutes, the second call was working with a woman in India, who\u0027s headset had a ton of static to add to her accent.  I had to end that session because we couldn\u0027t hear each other.

The lady from India did mention that mixing their product with any other wireless router would be a problem, and now I believe her\n",

    "\nI recently purchased a refurbished Toshiba Gigabeat F40 for about $150. Quite a bargain for a 40-gig MP3 player. However, upon reflection, I regret the purchase.\n\nThe Gigabeat hardware seems to be OK, with good sound quality etc. The major failing is with the included software. As other reviews have pointed out, the Gigabeat will only play encrypted tracks. The Gigabeat is supplied with Gigabeat Room application software to provide the necessary encryption. Gigabeat Room starts automatically when connected to the PC via the USB port. From the time the Gigabeat is connected till the Gigabeat Room application is displayed on the screen is 30 minutes. If you switch from viewing the Gigabeat file directory to the PC file directory, the application hangs. If you try to update your track library, the application hangs. I have yet to get  through a single operation from beginning to end without the program hanging. Every time the Gigabeat Room hangs, you have to restart the application, with yet another 30-minute wait to resume. The file directory on the Gigabeat is usually out of sync with what is actually present on the hard drive. Microsoft Media Player version 10 may also be used to synchronize the Gigabeat. I have a 35-gig library. It took Media Player 18 hours to encrypt and copy all 8100 tracks to the Gigabeat. In short, be prepared for a maddening and time consuming experience with this player. Software that gives error messages such as \"The Program Is Quitted\" and with such obvious fragility may have been expected in 1986 but is absolutely unreasonable in 2006.\n\nIn my estimation you would be much better off purchasing an MP3 player, even at greater cost, that can play MP3 files directly, with file maintenance provided by Windows Explorer and or Media Player.\n",

    "\nThe ONLY reason i bought this unit when I saw it in the store was for the iPod controller feature.  I really looked forward to being able to control my iPod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight.  Boy was I disappointed!  The iPod adpater works and all... but barely.  It takes FOREVER to scroll through the songs, artists or albums.  Why the hell would Alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the iPod so you can\u0027t even select songs from the iPod itself?  I have over 3000 songs on my iPod... by the time I scroll to the song I want I\u0027ve already reached my destination... and that\u0027s if I even find the song at all!  So now what I have to do is unplug my iPod, scroll to the song I want, then plug it back in. (Luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your iPod in.)  But again... that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck.  Bottom line, the iPod control feature flat SUCKS.  The deck features a \"quick search\" function... but it is uselss... it isn\u0027t used to search through artsts or albums... only individual songs and there\u0027s no way to skip 10, 20, 30 or 100 songs at a time... only 1 by 1... What\u0027s \"quick\" about that?   I have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and Alpine thinks I\u0027m supposed to go through them 1 by 1???? Another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the iPod is playing, the display just says \"song up\" or \"song down\" instead of just showing the name of the damn song!  Who thought of that?  What possible help could \"song up\" be to anyone? Just show the name of the song while I\u0027m skipping through... that makes more sense right?  There are a bunch of other problems I have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the iPod adapter and iPod... but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing... but then again... who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to\n",
    "\nI bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve, fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow, not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in, either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so\n",

This is about six times greater than the average ink cost for my old HP720c, which unfortunately does not work with my new HP Pavilion PC (no printer port on this model, among other issues).  I have vowed to not purchase any HP product in the future if I can possibly avoid it.  I just ordered a Canon Pixima to replace this ink hog.  On the positive side, the print quality is good, speed is excellent, and color fidelity is fair.  The software installed without incident, and the machine is easy to operate, but the HP software is overbearing and constantly trying to sell you something--worse than daytime television\n",

    "\nWe have bought 3 of these VTech Phones for our house. Since the begining we have had battery problems. It is really annoying when you have to make a phone call and your phone doesn\u0027t work because of the battery.\n\nAt any point in time, at least one of the phones constantly reports a \"low charge\" or \"no battery\" message, which means you can\u0027t use that phone. Of course, you can hear the ring from the phone that is never at the same room that you are, so you have to run to pick up the other phone, since the one in your location has the no battery problem.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time. \n\nOn the beginning we used to take the battery out of phone and put it back in. That doesn\u0027t quite work anymore. I tried to get support but you can\u0027t get a live person at the VTech number. On their website they suggest replacing the batteries, but they are rechargeable, so how many times are we really supposed to buy new rechargeable baterries (I have already replaced it once)?\n\nI know we wont buy VTech products again.\n",
    "\nIt\u0027s not often I find a product that\u0027s as disappointing as this. The interference problem is very serious and makes most conversations a pain. Moving around the house and outside of the house, standing on your head holding the phone at a 45 angle, etc., are part of the daily ritual in trying to hold a legibible conversation.\n\nBut that\u0027s not the bad part. The bad part, as at least one other reviewer has noted, is that each of the phones constantly reports a  \"low charge\" message or something similar. This in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time. The only solution I\u0027ve found is to take the battery out of phone and put it back in. Then it will work for a day or two. I suppose it could be just the batteries. But if so then we were shipped batteries that were already on life-support.\n\nI read a few good reviews of this phone, and of course there are a number right here. But out experience has been the opposite. The phones have been nothing other than a pain\n",
    "\nI picked up this headset telephone because I am spending more and more time on the phone.  \n\nAlmost immediately after plugging it in, everyone I called asked me to speak up, repeat what I said, and that they could not hear me very well.  \n\nWhen I attempted to setup a new voicemail system, I found out why.  The headphone is amplified, but the microphone is not.  No matter how loud I spoke (or shouted) the audio is severely suppressed and barely audible.\n\nSimply stated, this product is not usable.  \n",
    "\nI had this for approximately 2 years. It worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances. One day I left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour. During this period, the alarm was activated and I was embarrased to face my office workers. This is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm. I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months, it started the same problem.\n So, now I am afraid to use this security system with my laptop. But I did not face problems like changing the combination by its own. You can use it without the alarm activation (i.e: without batteries) but the cable is so thin, it is not recommended to protect any valubles\n",
    "\nI bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good Macintosh support.  Unfortunately the player does not work well with the Macintosh.  The included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import DSS files.  The software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window.  The use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from Windows 3.1.  The DS-2 appears to the finder as a standard USB disk and I have been able to copy the DSS files from the player to the compuer using the finder.  It is then possible to play the DSS files by double clicking them, but it will only play one file.  If you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the DSS player and relanch it.  Exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as AIFF is also nearly impossible.  There is an export function in the menu, when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears.  Unfortunately there is no other Macintosh software available to read or convert DSS files as Olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the Macintosh.  Search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the DSS files such as playing the entire file and re-recording it with another program\n",
    "\nGreat sound, but the build quality is just not there.  On a recent trip to Europe, the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver.  They are only two months old and I always keep them in the case!  I had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together.  Since then I\u0027ve also had to superglue the right bud as well.  Also, the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead, revealing the fine speaker wire underneath.  I don\u0027t expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad.  They are great sounding and comfortable, but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners.  Be warned\n",

I tried to loosen it and the wire was showing, what a piece of s***. Its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when I listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable. Also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily. They are too expensive for a piece of junk! The only reason I rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones. Instead purchase the Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style Headphone Radio. I purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better :)\n",
    "\nI SO wanted to love this thing. I have an iPod that I am seldom without, and my car isn\u0027t iPod compatible. I bought a Monster Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger so I could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion. Unfortunately, the thing just didn\u0027t work for me. \n\nThere are 8 preset stations (low on the dial) and if all of them are in use, you\u0027re out of luck. I don\u0027t live in a huge city (maybe 60,000 with farmland all around), but only two of these stations were available. Although I was able to tune in to my iPod, it wasn\u0027t crystal clear. In fact, it wasn\u0027t even plastic clear. The static sometimes overrode the music, which drove me nuts. This is like a fax machine - the original may be spotless, but the fax will be a little fuzzy. \n\nIf you have a cassette player in your car, there are adapters that go through the cassette player and are much better.

It\u0027s probably not because the lock  is defective. It\u0027s probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage.\nI would definitely never suggest this product to anyone (unless I really wanted their computer)\n",

I wanted something that I wouldn\u0027t cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won\u0027t be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I\u0027m on the hunt for better quality headphones\n",

I wanted a backup in case second died, so I ordered another one.  This third works least well of all.  At times, entire display is off, radio doesn\u0027t work at all, or it won\u0027t change channels.  Then other times it worked. Seems like might be affected by heat outside.

    "\nIsolation:\nI had to use the foam inserts because the plastic ones were a little too large for my ears. With the foam, it completely sealed my ear canal and blocked out most noise.  My commute home on the J train (light-rail) was quite silent.  I was listening to classical music for the first time on the train.  With earbuds, I had to put the volume level around 50%.  With the Sony MDR-EX71 model, I could to keep it around 40%.  The noise attenuation wasn\u0027t that good with the Sony model, but definitely better than earbuds (but the sound quality was quite terrible though.)\n\n\nSound Quality:\nSuperb sound.  The partnership with Etymotic Research is evident.  Everything sounded great:  rock, grunge, classical.  The Sonys sounded really muddy while these had a really bright sound with good bass (when the seal was good).  Very balanced sound.\n\nCord/Construction:\nI string my earphones through an REI One jacket, so this was more or less perfect length.  The cord is symmetric so it\u0027s not weirdly strung behind your neck like the Sonys, and the connection to the ear pieces is solid, not fragile-looking like the ER6.  The earphones connect to the replaceable eartips very tightly.  The included case is ridiculous though; it\u0027s way too bulky for portability.\n\nComfort/Fit:\nSadly, this is primary reason I\u0027m returning these.  Both the flanged rubber tips and the included foam tips were too big.  The foam models got the seal, but they were too big, so I felt an uncomfortable amount of pressure in my ear canals.  Those were my only two options with the included package.  The other problem is that I cannot find replacements that are smaller, anywhere on the web, including the Altec Lansing site.\n\nDocumentation:\nAnother reason I am returning these is the documentation.  The manual says that I can get replacement ear tips and accessories at alteclansing.com/inmotionearphones, and I get a 404 error when I visit the link.  That is pretty pathetic.\n\nUpdate:  (1/19/2006)I emailed Altec Lansing regarding this issue on 1/10/2006, and I have yet to get a response from them.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you have large ears, these may suit you.  But if you know that you have smaller ears, then stay away from these, and go for something else\n",

    "\nDuring the installation of the software on my PC running Windows 2000 Server, the installation program froze my PC completely. I had to turn off the PC, and now it does nothing when I turn it on. The lights on the front light up, but nothing happens at all. I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration. \n\nI went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms. \n\nSince I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system. He declined that offer.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I\u0027m left with a dead PC, but, according to Netgear, a perfectly good wireless card and installation CD. \n\nNo more Netgear for me, thank you!\n",

    "\nI recently purchased this item from Sharper Image and was very disappointed. \n\nThe video is faint, grainy (even in strong lighting), and out of focus once you are more than 2 feet away from the camera. Colors all but disappear. It\u0027s practically black-and-white video.\n\nThe power supply weighs more than the device itself (one pound, including cord) and is HUGE. It also gets very warm after an hour or so. \n\nI\u0027ve tested this product in every type of lighting situation and the results have been unsatisfactory in all cases. The only thing the device does well is detect motion.\n",
    "\nI bought this adapter along with the Linksys WRT54GL Broadband Router.  I managed to set them up and install them properly.  (The best advice I got from the \"Home Networking for Dummies\" book was to get a 100 foot Cat5e patch cable so that I could put my router in the place I where I wanted it, and hook it up with a wired connection first.  I actually only needed a 50 foot cable, and got it for $20 from a local electronics supply store.)\n\nSo I got everything up and running (remember to install your router first, and then your network adapter), surfed the internet for awhile, and then shut down my computer.  Here\u0027s where the trouble started....\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the Linksys installation makes changes to your Windows XP configuration, de-activating the Welcome screen and the feature Microsoft calls \"Fast User Switching.\"  This happens with no warning.\n\nWhen I went to turn on my computer again, I got a new start-up screen for Windows, demanding a password.  I freaked out, because I don\u0027t remember ever setting a password for Windows.  I called Linksys, and was extremely unimpressed with their customer support.  The young woman seemed to be amused by my problem, and was actually laughing at me.  She began to start me through the process of completely re-setting the router to the factory settings (this would NOT have helped).\n\nWhat finally helped was figuring out (with no help from Linksys) that if you never set a password for your Windows XP logon, all you have to do is hit \"Enter\" at the password prompt.  That\u0027s all there is.  Linksys could have told me this, or better yet, warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would take place and suggest setting up a User Password in advance.\n\nAnother gripe about this network adapter and the Linksys router--neither came with instruction manuals.  There is a 60-page instruction manual on the CD rom that comes with the product, but you\u0027ll have to print it out yourself (Do it before you install or try installing the product).  In the case of the router, I also had to do deep searching to actually find the instruction manual on the CD-ROM--it wanted to start up the Setup Wizard automatically and the instruction manual was not easy to access from the CD-ROM.  I guess this may be the norm now with computer hardware, but it still stinks.\n\nI do not recommend the Linksys WUSB54GC, primarily because of the unannounced changes it makes to the Windows XP system, and because of Linksys\u0027 non-existent or non-functional and rude customer support\n",
    "\nI have owned the TomTom Navigator 5 for almost a year now.  While the program is well thought out and provides a good function, it does not work well with my Tungsten T5.  I have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues (listed below), but to no avail.  \n\nSome of the issues I have had:\n\nAny time the software has to redirect or think, it locks up.  If I stay on the original planned route, it sometimes works properly...\n\nIn a 30 minute trip from Orange County to Long Beach, I had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up.\n\nVoices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device.\n\nIn a 20 minute trip from San Francisco to Oakland the device locked up 5 times.  I finally gave up and called a friend to guide me.\n\nBear in mind, I have had no problems with my T5 in the 1.5 years of ownership...it is only with this software.  Customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing.  \n\nIn summary, it\u0027s not worth spending the money to have to print out Mapquest directions to have when the device crashes...stick with Mapquest\n",
    "\n  Essentially once TomTom has your money they\u0027re finished with you . . . until you want to spend more money with them.\n\n  The product is okay. The map data is from TeleAtlas, a vendor to many of the map software producers. What makes TomTom different is its GUI (Graphic User Interface) that the user interacts with. It really is a work of art most of the time. The map presentations are rich and may be viewed as 3D or 2D. The planning interface is icon driven and easy-to-use. Unfortunately TomTom really didn\u0027t think it all the way through.\n\n  There are several irritants, all of which vie for first place. One is that TomTom doesn\u0027t give you the option of using its maps without a GPS. There are many instances where I know where I am begining from and going to and I don\u0027t need a GPS fix. TomTom ignores such desires and annoyingly keeps prompting for you to start your Bluetooth connection. There is one mode that you can use to plan a route without a GPS and it simply doesn\u0027t work very well, often informing you that TomTom can\u0027t route you from a point beginning on an interstate to another point further along the same highway. That\u0027s just plain dumb. This is a mapping application. If I want to use these expensive maps for walking directions without a GPS, I should be able to. TomTom certainly doesn\u0027t think so.\n\n  Another irritant is the documentation. Probably in an effort to make TomTom appealing to the casual user, the documentation is dog simple . . . and often wrong. It appears that they didn\u0027t update the documentation to the newest version.\n\n  Although you can load maps by region, TomTom makes no allowance for travelling from one region to another. You have to calculate your route to the ending point within one region and then begin it anew in the next region. Again, this strikes me as a silly omission. If you are in Wisconsin, which is one region, and drive to Minnesota, which is in another, you have to create two routes. Not bright.\n\n  There are a number of idiosyncracies, anomalies and bugs that drive me up a wall. However, overall, TomTom is still better than the competition. It computes routes quickly (when it is capable of figuring a route at all). Annoying, however, it tends to prefer expressways, regardless of your preferences. In a major metro area laced with expressways going in all directions, this can create some incredibly convoluted - and ridiculous - routes. Creating alternative and more logical routes is possible, but tedious.\n\n  The worst part of the TomTom experience is its customer support. Well, perhaps support is the wrong word for it. I encountered two problems installing the software. It was obviously that the tech support person was clueless and was simply guessing and grasping at straws. (I had resolved the issues before the rep called and already knew what the problem was.) The TomTom rep didn\u0027t listen, kept interrupting and when it was pointed out that he was contradicting the manual, he just kept moving. (The manual in at least one instance was correct and the rep wrong.)\n\n  The TomTom packaging itself arrived in broken condition. The rep denied it was their packaging, claiming that I must have bought a third-party repackaged product. Talk about insulting: I have the package in front of me with the TomTom labels, the whole works and this guy is telling me that my lying eyes are deceiving me?\n\n  A fax to TomTom management about my experiences has gone unanswered more than a week later.\n\n  TomTom is riding high right now but I suspect in a couple of years as competitors introduce better products with better support that TomTom will be history. It won\u0027t be the first company that offered a good-enough product without support and possesing contempt for its customers to disappear and it won\u0027t be the last.\n\n  I know that if I find a marginally better product with adequate support, I\u0027d abandon TomTom in a flash.\n\nJerr\n",
    "\nThe TomTom Navigator is a nice enough device, until you get to the Maps activation. The Maps activation? Why should I have to activate my maps if I have paid for the product? Good question, well, I activated these maps on one PDA, and within 2 weeks my PDA died and I had to obtain warranty service. Well, I decided that I would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when I got it back from the manufacturers (I tend to switch my PDA every 3-4 months anyway).\n\nSo I installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate. OK, I figure...no problem, I will be able to activate it 1...2...3 because after all, only I have the activation card/code. No such luck, TomTom wants PROOF that I have brought a new device? what kind of nonsense is that? What if I lost my PDA in 2-3 months? What if I\u0027m a nut who likes to change PDA\u0027s every 3-4 months? What, you mean I have to show you proof that I switched? Isn\u0027t the fact that I have the activation card proof enough? I don\u0027t know too many people who pay $269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes.\n\nAvoid them at all costs. You will regret your purchase if you change devices frequently.\n\nOne other problem with this product...out of the box it is not 100% compatible with Windows Mobile 5 devices (most of the new Axims are WM5. You really have to break your back to install on these devices.\n\nAvoid\n",
    "\nI agree, this is a flimsy piece of plastic that will not hold the GPS unit over a few little bumps. I expected more from Garmin. Consider this: Touratech Mount for Garmin 60C series. Its a solid unit. It costs a little more but you won\u0027t be replacing your GPS unit due to it falling to the ground.\n",
    "\n   My company car has a built-in GPS unit and I have gotten to like it, sort-of.  I have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around Silicon Valley enough to get a portable GPS unit.  After some research, the Garmin iQue 3600 is what I ended up with and I paid about $700.  The unique feature of this portable GPS unit is that a PalmPilot comes integrated into the package.   I use a PalmPilot, so this GPS unit replaces my PalmV.    Installation was quite awkward, and getting it up and running was a chore.   I got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now.  It does do the job, fitfully, and has several glaring issues.  Most irritating, the Palm function and the GPS function are not seamlessly integrated.  If an address is entered in the Palm part and then route to this address is selected, the iQue 3600 makes you find the location.  But the address from the Palm section doesn\u0027t transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address.  I\u0027m left-handed and graffiti has NEVER worked for me all my letters are drawn backward.  The GPS can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go, but my unit takes a good 5-10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky.   This means that I must have a good idea what to do for the first 5-10 minutes.  Sometimes I just drive randomly until the GPS locks in and starts to issue navigation orders.  Also, the antenna must be deployed to get any GPS reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky.  This is OK, except that the iQue 3600 doesn\u0027t tell you that the antenna has not been deployed.  \n   The iQue 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard.  If the antenna is not deployed, the iQue 3600 simply doesn\u0027t navigate and doesn\u0027t tell you why.  Worse, it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode.  If I ever figure out what that means, Ill tell you in a future post.  I figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of Ottawa.  I\u0027m a fan of GUI design, and I must say that the UI here is very, very bad.  Not the worse I have ever seen, but very bad:  non-intuitive, inconsistent, and arbitrary.  The FIND function/button has an entirely different function in the GPS section from the Palm section.  Of course, the same icon is used.  I cannot imagine grandma using this thing to navigate.  What little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious.  About 10 times more information is needed here.  It shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose (Battery savings maybe?).\n   The secure digital card is too small (max of 256MB), so you can\u0027t put more than a few California counties in the memory.  Maps storage is managed with a rather hostile GUI.  This is not fatal, but is irritating.  I would rather put a 1GB SD card in the iQue 3600 and be done with it.\n   The iQue 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable, so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle.  I don\u0027t find the power issue to be a problem.  I understand that to get clear, bright screens it is necessary to use power.  I agree with the tradeoff here.\n",
    "\nSummary........good idea, very poor implementation.  Good software and easy to use, major problem is reception of radio stations.  I live in a major metropolitan area and have to practically stand on my head to get the radio shark to get clear reception (even with a plug in antennae)\n",
    "\nThe price on the cases is cheap but you get what you pay for.  I will never buy these cases again.  Quite a few of them were broke when I got them.  Even the ones that weren\u0027t broke are made of VERY flimsy plastic and I have a feeling they will break if I open them very often.  They also don\u0027t open and shut very easy.  Look elsewhere for good cases\n",

    "\nThey sell these at almost every dollar store, sure the sound quality might not be quite as good, but you\u0027re going to have signal loss whatever you hook it up to. These things sell for $1.50 CAN at  dollar stores and are worth every penny of THAT pric\n",
    "\nAlright before I begin let me just say I know quite a bit about wireless networking.  I had already connected 2 wireless pc\u0027s to my 128 bit WEP encrypted router.  I had initially set it up as WPA but opted to change it as this hunk of junk doesn\u0027t support WPA.  This card will detect your network no problem, just try connecting to it.  Apparently I am typing in the wrong WEP pass.... I can assure you I am not.  Perhaps there is an issue between Micro$oft and D-link I am unaware of...go figure.  I do not have the time nor patience to deal with Micro$oft\u0027s customer support regarding this issue.  Back to the store this goes.  Do yourself a favour and do not buy this\n",
    "\nMicrosoft has never failed to disappoint me, (I suppose there is something to be said for consistency) and this carries on that somewhat dubious tradition. I bought this with a the MN-700 wireless router, and both worked fine for a couple weeks. However, they both conspiratively proceeded to stop functioning. This card was the most maddening of the pair, because it would find the wireless network every once in a while, yet refuse to connect. I\u0027ve tried every channel, and made sure its on infrastructure mode, but it still refuses to work. I suppose I deserve it, though, expecting that a microsoft wireless card would connect to a microsoft wireless router with a microsoft operating system. Do yourself a favor and buy your wireless networking from a decent company that has some expertise in networking, like Linksys or Belkin. Whatever you do, give as little money as possible to this shoddy company\n",

    "\nI do not recommend Sennheiser\u0027s MX75 headphones.\n\nFirst, the good features:\n1. As with all Sennheiser products, these earphones deliver first rate sound for its price range.\n2. The earphones are very comfortable and easy to fit properly using the included pads.\n3. Once inserted in the ear, these earphones will not fall out due to vibration, movement or sweating.\n\nHowever, the cord has ugly problems:\n1. The cord is unusually stiff and consequently tends to be tough to manage. This is especially true when the phones are first removed from the package, as the cord maintains a sort of corkscrew shape for quite some time.\n2. The cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone. The result is annoying slack around the face and neck.\n3. The cord is the ugliest possible shade of green.\n\nAll in all, should Sennheiser offer a new product using the same earphones, but with conventional wiring, I\u0027ll be a buyer. Until then, I\u0027ve given up on using these lime green annoyances\n",
    "\nI bought this TV for my husband to take hunting but we can\u0027t get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture.   The TV is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen.  I didn\u0027t hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we don\u0027t have cable.  I tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other.  I tried programming with the antenna on the TV and with separate rabbit ears.   It would only pick up one of the three local network stations.  It picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which aren\u0027t popular.   I couldn\u0027t get a good picture on any of the stations and I tried adjusting all the menu items, brightness, hue, etc.  It didn\u0027t even have a good black and white picture .... it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back.

Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though. On the Mac, each key has its own embedded light under the key. On the Saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard, reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys.  But it\u0027s better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life\n",

Oh boy was I wrong.\n\nEven the though I get full bars with these cards, I get very flaky connections with them. I\u0027ve tried many different settings and firmwares to try to rectify the problem. Many hours have been spent trying to get a stable connection. No dice, very flaky.\n\nOther computers with different cards work fine with the wrt54gs and never dropout.

Also, probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight - that is, they fade in and out when you walk around the room.  This should not be a problem on this low bandwidth (but it is), perhaps the antenna needs a boost\n",

    "\nCheap piece of junk. Probably has 2 cents of electronic parts in it. I\u0027m returning it to Wallmart. It might work OK if you live like right next door to the broadcast transmitter. Otherwise it\u0027s just too weak in its signal pulling ability. Also, when I turn the gain dials, they don\u0027t seem like they are really variable. I think they are really just on/off switches disguised as variable dials, because i don\u0027t see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels. I\u0027m going to now go to a REAL, serious electronics store and look for some SERIOUS tv electronics hardware instead of Wallmart garbage. I\u0027m going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and I\u0027m going to try using a variable gain preamp if I can find one (a high quality one, not junk). I tried a preamp from Wallmart (which wasn\u0027t adjustable at all) and it did help a lot with UHF channels, but the VHF channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong. So I need a variable gain preamp, assuming there is such a thing.

I couldn\u0027t find just a headset amp so I purchased this \"system\" based on Plantronics\u0027 good name. \n\nInstead of just plugging it into the wall phone jack, you have to use a regular phone, route the receiver/handset cord to this, then back out to the receiver/handset again, which makes this light unit basically hamstrung between the headset and handset and doesn\u0027t want to sit on the desk without taping it down. Then you have to take the receiver/handset off the hook, place it on the desk (assuming you have desk space, which I don\u0027t) then push a button to start up the headset. \n\nMost importantly, listening sound quality was muffled and not very loud. If I turned up the incoming sound volume, it immediately put a loud annoying squeal of feedback into the microphone, making it totally unusable. \n\nI went back to my regular, unampflied Plantronics headset which just plugs into the wall phone and is always on with no extra cords, ac adapter, or buttons to push. I\u0027m not very thrilled with that, but for $15 it sounds MUCH better and much louder, without the feedback or the hassles. So for now I guess I\u0027ll stick with that until I find something else that just improves the incoming sound\n",

But, then the wireless connection with the print server got flaky, so I switched to the wired mode. All was well again, but then after a couple of weeks the wired connection got flaky. It stopped printing and didn\u0027t recognize my HP-1200. After fiddling around with it for a few hours I finally got the contraption working again.\n\nBut, now my latest problem is that the print server prints garbage to the printer! Plugging the printer directly in to a computer works fine, but the print service somehow corrupts the data going to the printer and I end up with pages of garbage and error messages.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis thing was a beast to set-up and every time something goes wrong, it takes a phenomenal amount of time to debug and correct.

    "\nMy husband bought me this for Christmas because we were moving to a new city. He picked it out because unlike Garmin and Magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road. The features are easy to use, the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic - it really comes up with a great plan. However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well. I was very reluctant to buy a different brand - but had to for dependability. I still don\u0027t like my Garmin as much - but at least it works. Come on Tomtom - get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions\n",
    "\nI\u0027m a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghz-G5. There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase, so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use, I plan on returning it. The major problem lies with the pen--both in design and responsiveness. \n\nDesign: the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos, and there\u0027s a good reason why: the Graphire pen is thinner, lighter, and has no grip. If you have very small hands this might be acceptable; in my hand this feels like a toothpick. It\u0027s very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it doesn\u0027t feel like it has any durability. Additionally, the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it.\n\nResponsiveness: There is a half-second delay whenever using the pen to click in any finder-related options--opening windows, selecting files, etc. 1/2 second may sound acceptable, but if you, like me, use the pen for everything, not just drawing, believe me it is utterly maddening. On the other hand, the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all, so I know it\u0027s the pen and not my computer.\n\nThe tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine, but the bottom line is that it\u0027s more important for me to have a responsive, durable pen than a wireless tablet. If you\u0027ve never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies, but for those who have, this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic. You\u0027ll get better gas mileage with the Civic but the Benz gives you the  best overall driving experience. I need the driving experience, so I\u0027m going back to the Intuos--wire and all.\n",
    "\nI know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they\u0027re selling shoddy products. I\u0027m not saying don\u0027t buy it. There aren\u0027t realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I\u0027m going to dig out my old discman\n",

I thought it a little unusual at the time, but after listening to the thing I understand why now.  I\u0027m sure a lot of people had been returning this model.\n\nThe sound quality was really bad.  You have to turn your stereo WAY up to hear the music, and even then it sounds almost as bad as AM radio.

Also, with an ADF flatbed, you can scan books, and unusual documents (thin paper, very heavy paper) that an ADF (and the ScanSnap) won\u0027t process by simply lifting the lid of the ADF and taking the scan directly on the glass.

These lasted about twice as long, before the battery life just became worthless. We are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time - say, 1 hour. And you can\u0027t talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out, and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again. And yes, we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge, and all that kind of stuff.

The Tahoe does. \n\nI returned this Monster unit and picked up the Sony Sony CPA-9C. \n\nThe Sony device is a bit different as it has small link of simulated audio tape within the tape path. This little bit of simulated audio tape effectively fools the tape unit not to think that there is an error and eject the Cassette Adapter. There are other reasons that these adapters will auto-eject (Google is your friend). But the Sony unit seemed to be the solution for me. \n\nThe big reason for the zero star review is that Monster has ZERO information on their web site or product packaging regarding device compatibility or troubleshooting. \n\n",

    "\nI bought this unit a couple of years ago based on its features, but soon discovered that it can\u0027t normally do the one thing that all GPSs should, tell you where you are.  I used my e-Trex Vista for about a year and half and would estimate that I spent 10% to 15% of the time staring at some type of lost signal message.  The unit is totally useless under any type of tree cover and often has trouble holding a signal anywhere on overcast days, which means about half the time in the Seattle area where I live.  I would not recommend this unit to anyone but my worst enemy\n",
    "\nI had this GPS device for only 3 days and found it to be no better than mediocre.\n\nAlthough at one point I was able to track 6 WAAS satellites and the display claimed accuracy to 17 feet, while driving along a straight road for 5.5 miles, it indicated that I was traveling approximately 350 feet to the side of the road.  On two occasions on this straight road, it said I actually crossed the road and traveled on the opposite side.\n\nI conducted a test by placing the unit where it would have an unobstructed view of the sky for 1 hour and leave it motionless.  The trip computer reported that it had moved nearly a quarter-mile during that hour.  I checked the accuracy at 15-minute intervals and it was constantly reporting accuracy between 12-24 feet.\n\nThe base maps are crude and inaccurate - a major 4-lane road (Hwy 7) in Tacoma, WA stops at 38th street.  Really?!?  If I drive down Hwy 7, it goes a couple of miles farther than the unit shows.\n\nWhile using the compass you must hold the unit level in order to obtain accurate readings - understandable.  There is even a little message that tells you to hold it level if you are off a little - nice.  I tried and tried to find \"level\" according to the unit and after about 3 or 4 minutes was able to determine where \"level\" was.  It was nowhere close to actual level.  Now, if I am trying to navigate with the unit\u0027s compass while it is mounted to my bike, there is no way it is going to be level and accurate.\n\nAt 5.3 ounces, it doesn\u0027t even pass off as a good paperweight.\n\nFortunately I was able to return it to the seller with no problems for a full refund (Thank you REI!).  I found out that Wal-Mart.com sells the unit for 50 bucks less than REI after I bought it though.\n\nRecommendation:  If you need a paperweight, get a rock - if you need a GPS, get a different one.\n",

After trying FOUR of these units I can assure you this is a LEMON.   Please note these positive reviews are from buyer who had their units for two weeks or similar time periods.   I have had four different units for ONE YEAR and can tell you THIS IS JUNK!    Selling this crap on ebay and buying a REAL unit.   NOT SONY!\n",
    "\nWe needed to know if this unit (Philips DVD 782C) was compatible with DVD+RW disks so I Googled it and found this Amazon listing.\n\nWe were totally amazed to find the reviews we found ... and wish we had done this years ago INSTEAD OF SPENDING ALL THIS TIME STRUGGLING WITH THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A DVD PLAYER. We have spent countless hours MR. Clean\u0027ing and SkipDr\u0027ing disks just to get them to play (and sometimes even that didn\u0027t work).\n\nJust in case anyone else comes along, take the excellent advice given several times in this collection of reviews ... RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION WITHOUT QUESTION IF SOMEONE OFFERS YOU THIS DVD PLAYER.\n\nNow, we do NOT believe this is a fundamental problem with Philips. We have, and have had, many fine products sold by Philips. We are guessing this particular DVD player was the result of some very poor product planning that went very badly before, during and after the fact. Hopefully the person(s) responsible has (have), per usual corporate practice, been promoted farther up the ladder where they can no longer inflict this kind of pain on Customers.\n\n\nP.S. We tried to give this product \"0\" stars but Amazon requires at least \"1\" star. Probably a quid pro quo agreement of some sort we imagine\n",
    "\nUnfortunately my wife and I purchased this \u0026quot;product\u0026quot; without reading the posted reviews here. ALL are entirely accurate! I cannot calculate how many hours I have spent trying to figure out what is wrong. No loading, skipping, freezing, not OPENING when it freezes, all down the line, combined with 100 trips to and from the video stores to exchange their \u0026quot;defective\u0026quot; DVDs. My wife was firmly of the belief the DVDs were just \u0026quot;dirty\u0026quot; but I finally decided (this agrees with one of the reviewers) there is a balance problem in the drawer. When there is a no-load, jiggling/adjusting the drawer sometimes (not always) fixes it, but only until the next time, and will not stop the freezing problems. If my wife had a dime for every time I said \u0026quot;this thing is a piece of @\u0026amp;*!\u0026quot; she would be a millionaire. This is very late but if this product is still on the market in ANY form stay many miles away. And Philips\u0027 arrogant lack of response (as reported; I have no personal experience here) is virtually criminal in this day and age\n",
    "\nFor some years I tried this and other Monster products, to the tune of over $1000 in Monster a/v gear. The more you learn about video and audio, the more you\u0027ll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff? I removed every piece of Monster from my system and replaced them with AR, Belden, Viewsonics and others from Amazon. Result: vast improvement in every respect.\n",
    "\n~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don\u0027t know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don\u0027t use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don\u0027t want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don\u0027t have a benchmark to evaluate it.\n",

I submitted a ticket \u0026 guess how long before I heard a response. \u0026 the response was \"ship the item back for a refund\".

    "\nI am shocked by the amount of positive reviews on this site.  Let me tell you about my experience.  I bought this machine in June of 2005.  In one year, I have replaced this machine THREE TIMES.  All three times, I got error messages that the toner cartridge was out (Toner Life End) even when new toner cartridges were put in.  I do give high marks to Brother for its customer service, though.  Each time I had a problem, I called and they sent out a replacement by FedEx along with materials for me to send back the broken one.  But when the fourth replacement arrived last week and I turned it on and got an immediate paper jam message, I had enough.  I had a similar issue with a Brother mutlifunction machine I purchased around the same time.  I am done with Brother products\n",
    "\nI ordered this keyboard/mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth, so I returned it.  I\u0027m sure it would have been great if I had used it but my Mac has blue tooth and I thought I was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse.   \nI got an apple blue tooth keyboard instead and I found a logitech blue tooth mouse, which I also got.  (Apple doesn\u0027t offer a decent blue tooth 2 button mouse in anything like an acceptably reasonable price range)\n",
    "\nI purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse.  I wanted something with two separate buttons.  I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful.  So, I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse.  I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well.  In fact, I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons.\n\nOther than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse, this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment.\n\nFirst of all, the white doesn\u0027t quite match.  It\u0027s close, but just a touch too cream.  Also, there\u0027s just too much silver.  Especially on the mouse.\n\nSecondly, it doesn\u0027t have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does.  There is no button to switch to the Widgets.  Luckily, you can press F12 on the keyboard.  Not quite as convenient, but still possible.  However, I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs.  This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open.\n\nThirdly, this mouse just doesn\u0027t work as well as other Logitechs.  It is too light, lacking the \"feel\" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around.  Also, the speed of the cursor is off.  No matter how I try to adjust the speed, it doesn\u0027t quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse.  It is either too fast or too slow.  I think part of it is simply OSX\u0027s lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed.\n\nFinally, the keyboard is simply atrocious.  I don\u0027t even use it anymore.  It\u0027s packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in.  The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing.  The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal.  Also, the depth is quite shallow.  This is a desktop keyboard.  You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I\u0027ve tried.  Also, the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform.  The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow.  I can\u0027t find the asdf an jkl; rows by touch.  I have to look.  As a touch typist, this is an unforgiveable sin.  It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it.  I\u0027m typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech.\n\nSo, in short, save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo.  I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons, unlike the Mighty Mouse, which is why I purchased this in the first place.  It hit my most basic requirement.  Otherwise, it really deserves a 1 star rating\n",

    "\nI bought this unit because a DLink Sales Rep said it would be perfect for my application. Hah! It doesn\u0027t work at all (I hope Amazon will let me return it). The first thing I had to do was upgrade the firmware - no instructions on how to do this, but for the uninitiated: you have to download the .ftp file from Dlink, move it to the Dlink Firmware folder on your computer, then get the AP Manager to see your unit (that\u0027s another story involving IP addresses - again, no help from the install documents), and then you can install the update. I finally got the DWL-2100AP to see my network, but never could get it to talk back - it just sent gibberish. The Net tech and I worked on it for most of two working days, to no avail. Spent a lot of time on the phone with the DLink tech staff too, where everyone involved said we got some bad dope from the sales staff, but that we might get it to work, provided it is compatible with the existing equipment blah, blah, blah... My assessment of Dlink and the DLINK DWL-2100AP? Poor pre-sales support, poor post-sales support, confusing tech support, and poor documentation/install instruction for a product that may be (but then again, may not be) compatible with your existing equipment.

    "\nMy family and I just relocated 3 states away from our extended family and wanted to get a good webcam to keep intouch with everyone and let our 2 year old see his grandmother once and a while.  When I saw the Microsoft LifeCam at Target stores and that it was compatible with Windows Live I thought it would be worth the $100 price tag to be able to keep in touch with family.\n\nI purchased the software and started the installation process on my computer.    Just so you know,my system is running a pentium 4 processor and has 8 active USB 2.0 connections, only 3 of which are being used for the keyboard, mouse, and this webcam, along with 512MB of RAM which is more than necessary for this product to function.\n\nThe software took about 10 minutes to install which I thought was a little odd, then it askes for you to plug in the camera.  My XP system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly.  I uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result.  I then tried a different USB port just in case there was a problem.  Following a stepwise process I checked and updated all drivers for the USB hub, ports, etc. and I checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly.  I then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software (this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice).\n\nBy now I was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera.  I went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic, but it said that there was no camera attached.  I again tried to find the camera through other means with no results.\n\nFor the price paid and the 3+ hours I spent trying to install the hardware I can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it.  I will be returning it to Target for a full refund and will look into investing my money with another brand.\n\nAs someone else said earlier in the reviews, \"does microsoft ever send their products through Quality Assurance before they release them?\n",
    "\nDont microsoft ever send their software thru Quality Assurance checking?

    "\nI\u0027ve found these headphones to be highly overrated.  \n\nThe noise cancelling is primarily from the snug fit in the ear.  When the noise circuit is turned on, the background \"hiss\" becomes incredibly annoying.  To be fair though, this model does remove some background low frequency sound, even in addition to the the noise reduction from the ear plugs.  \n\nThe frequency response during playback sounds like an old am radio\n",
    "\nIn terms of sound quality, noise cancelling, and general comfort - thise headphones are top of the line. I absolutely love the way the sound and the ammount of noise cancelling that they provide. I used them regularly when mowing the lawn and when flying, and I always recieved the highest quality sound and noise cancelleation. I was even able to listen to drum-n-bass while mowing the lawn and hear all of the appropriate frequencies on the low end. \n\nHowever... inside of 6 months, I have gone through 2 pairs of these headphones because the right ear headphone has gone out on them. The worst part is - I can\u0027t even begin to imagine why it goes out. I keep my heaphones in a locked cabinet in my office every night. Last friday, I placed back into the nice little carry bag that they come with, and placed them into this cabinet. This morning when I pulled them out for use, the right ear bud is out again... no physical damage is apparent anywhere on the headphones, and there is not a broken wire anywhere. In fact, the wiring is perfectly fine and still functional. It is the physical earbud - the hard plastic peice - that has gone out. If i squeeze the earbud hard enough, it will turn on again. \n\nSomething inside of the earbud is obviously designed improperly and I would highly recommend that noone purchase these headphones because of this\n",
    "\nSomeone previously pointed out that these earphones did not filter out the highs well. It may be the highs all I know is the only thing it seems to filter well is my wife and kids voices and allow in every other ambiant noise around. \n\nNow I may have gotten a lemon but the sound is poor. Volume cranked to high on any device I put this on comes out low at best. Put in any other set of earphones and it is painfully loud. \n\nThe little inline triangle that has the on/off switch is cumbersome and is at a strange distance from the earphones. Just seems to far from the earphones or not far enough. Just doesn\u0027t seem to clip naturally anywhere. Either to much cord or not enough. \n\nI am not a music or sound expert by any means so it does not bode well that I think these earphones are poor at best\n",

I\u0027ve previously used a basic Kensington all in one model  (stolen by wife, worked well but awkward) and ended up replacing this with a far superior Griffin Road Trip.  I reccommend spending the extra $15 on the Road Trip.\n",

    "\nI have the same problem some other reviewers had: the audio was extremely low unless I manually adjust the cassette.  It\u0027s not that easy - you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there, and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts.  But that doesn\u0027t always work.  If that doesn\u0027t work, you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit.  I\u0027d rather not have an accident on the highway by either (1) fiddling with the audio, or (2) smashing the adapter into little pieces while I drive.\n\nHundreds of songs on the ipod and no way to listen while you drive...\n\n",

I can\u0027t do other tasks while the card is uploading files since everything is acting sparatic and slow.\n\nI\u0027ll admit, the card is a bit faster in uploading files than USB 1.1, but I can\u0027t do anything else on my computer while the card is working.  Honestly, I would rather have a little bit slower performance with my USB 1.1 card reader and be able to work on my computer at the same time instead of having the card slow down my entire system.\n\nI believe this card is a 16-bit pcmcia card.  I\u0027ve heard good praise for Lexar\u0027s 32-bit pcmcia cards, but I have yet to try it out.  I\u0027m sure it costs more money than this PC card or a USB card reader, though...\n\n\nAll in all, I suggest getting a USB 2.0 compact flash reader over this product if you want to work on your computer at the same time as you are uploading files.\n\nOtherwise, if your the kinda person who doesnt mind leaving the computer alone while the files are uploaded to your computer, this will work just fine for you\n",
    "\nand the worst part is that I\u0027m actually glad about it!\n\nI bought this set to replace a [...]Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard combo that was about 3 years old when the mouse scroll wheel stopped working.\n\nI figured I\u0027d treat myself to what looked like the best wireless set out there.  Here\u0027s what I found:\n\n1) The keyboard is HUGE.  I have Dell 19\" flat panel and the keyboard looks ridiculous in front of it.\n\n2) Even though the USB dongle is plugged in the Dell monitor about 1 foot from the mouse/keyboard it still loses its connection and I get the message \"USB device has malfunctioned.\"  I have to remove and replace the dongle and it starts again.  This happens a couple of times a week, but of course at the most inconvenient times.\n\n3) The keyboard goes to sleep like the mouse after a few minutes to save battery life.  The mouse will wake up after a slight delay and I\u0027m used to that but I can\u0027t tell you how many times I pressed \"Ctrl-C\" to copy something into the buffer and then discovered that it didn\u0027t \"take\" because the keyboard was asleep.  The keyboard should never go to sleep or this \"feature\" should have a way to be disabled!\n\n4) The keyboard died (stopped responding) at less than 6 months old.  I still use the mouse but dug out an ancient Dell quietkey wired keyboard.  Frankly I don\u0027t miss the behemoth MS monster at all, at least the old keyboard doesn\u0027t take up the whole desk and when I hit Ctrl-C it works every time.\n\nMicrosoft has made some good keyboards and mice, but this set is not one of them.  Buyer beware. \n",

I even put the Bluetooth adapter on a USB extension cord and placed it within inches of the mouse, but that didn\u0027t help at all.\n\nThe keyboard seemed to work well, but I didn\u0027t use it for very long because the mouse was unbearable to use.

    "\nSpeaking from real experience, don\u0027t waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price. I bought a few top of the line monster cables once I got the top of the line SONY XBR960 HDTV. Later on I switched cables around, with other brand, cheaper component cables such as Philips PTS1000 (the HDMI standard owner by the way), and also other HDMI cables (even no name brands coming with my DVD player). You know what? I see absolutely no difference even under close examination. The SONY XBR960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any TV. You think about what that means. Stop buying this ridiculously priced cables, and save your $$ and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list. Digital is digital.

    "\nNEW are notorious thieves in the consumer electronics repair industry.  I personally submitted for repair both a $1,600 video camera (Sony DCR-PC5) and a car CD player (a Sony CDX-C90, a $1,200 in-dash top of the line unit.  If you\u0027ve heard of it, you know what I\u0027m talking about).  I was told that the warranty did not cover what was wrong with my video camera (some ambiguous statement about logic board, power unit, etc. failure followed), and would have to pay ~$780 to have it fixed.  I naturally refused, and was forced to keep my dead 4 month-old handycam, an unfortunate testament to some of Sony\u0027s now widely publicized QC issues.  The reason I did not send in the camera initially has to do with the fiasco involving my CD player.  I was told, explicitly, that if NEW could not fix it, they would either return the unit or write me a check in the amount of $1,000 (not even enough to cover the cost of the player).  As an added insult, when they indeed could not fix the unit, they KEPT it, and I NEVER received a check!!!  Simply outrageous!  Blatant theft, and I\u0027m not the only one who will tell you a story about NEW and such an act.  They are IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of, and literally take your money and run/disappear.  Don\u0027t expect to ever hear from them, should your camera stop working, and good luck getting ahold of them if you happen to send it in beforehand.  Chances are, you will have to eat the loss, as I did.  This product deserves a negative star and should come with an automatic refund.  I seriously thought it was a gag when I saw NEW was in charge of the coverage.  What a joke!  Whoever runs your company, NEW, ought to be both ashamed of themselves and held liable for all the countless damages and losses they have caused.  The whole lot of you belong in an unfriendly prison\n",

After several phone calls and emails of providing information for the requested refund. They finally tell me that it will take 8 weeks for my refund to process. That is two whole months.

I would not recommend this four year service plan or any other plan by N.E.W. Customer Service Companies to anyone\n",

    "\nI really wanted to like the TomTom Navigator 5.  \n\nThe GPS itself is tiny, well-designed, and very sensitive.  It worked fine from down in a underdash cupholder or in the glove compartment.\n\nThe interface is attractive and easy to navigate.  The voice prompts are clear and loud.\n\nThe installation on a Mac was problematic.  Search on TomTom OSX for details, but suffice it to say that the installer included on the CDs simply doesn\u0027t work and a new one must be downloaded.  Once past that, it ran fine on my Treo 700p.\n\nUnfortunately there is one fatal flaw - the map database.  In using the Navigator in both California and North Carolina, the maps regularly had misnamed streets, exits referred to by numbers where there were none, and directions that lacked critical information like heading (i.e. take the 101 instead of take 101N when approaching a complex interchange).  \n\nWorse, the company seems to be actively hostile to updating these maps.  If you go to the TomTom site, you can purchase maps on a city-by-city basis.  Are they newer than the ones that came with your unit?  Who knows?  TomTom lists no version info and seems to expect you to buy and cross your fingers.\n\nThere were just too many errors that I saw while traveling in areas that I\u0027m familiar with to trust the TomTom maps for any unfamiliar territory.  Everything else is great, but the whole point of a GPS is accurate navigation.  And sadly, that\u0027s where the TomTom Navigator fails\n",

So,  I cannot comment on downloading ringtones, wallpapers, etc.   (Meanwhile, these mobile phone-like features were the main reason I wanted this particular cordless phone).\n\nSecondly, the built in digital message recorder is of the lowest quality.   I was looking for an alternative to the monthly charge for voice mail through the phone company.    This isn\u0027t it. If you prefer to record your own message in lieu of the generic built-in message options, your Callers will here something sounding like a worn-out Edison recording.   It struck me as odd that with the included audio cable, you can connect the handset to an audio device with a headphone jack, to record custom ring tones, with good quality results.  Yet, to record a message for the digital answering machine, you need to speak into the dinky little microphone hole on the base unit, with the aforementioned low sound quality.  \n\nFinally, the battery life of the handset is rather short.  This is despite the (too) low backlighting on the handset keypad.  Oh, why no backlighting on the base unit? \n",

HP has introduced this rather secretely and if you don\u0027t read the box cover etc very carefully, you may not notice. The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective. HP Customer Support (Europe) was snotty and very rude.

    "\nWe drink a lot of coffee all day, every day.  So we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and fresher-tasting.  We first bought the 10-cup Capresso MT-500 which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly.  The coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great.  Unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it.  So instead of another expensive Capresso replacement, we decided to try a Japanese model which we thought might be more reliable.  We have been using the Zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly.  No leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the Capresso.  Unfortunately, there is no water filter system in this model compared to others (we had taken this for granted and not checked for it).  And no reuseable metal mesh filter (that I could find on the market) instead of paper filters.  The water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds.  We are not sure why our coffee just doesn\u0027t taste very good anymore, but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality.  Today, we pulled out our very old Krups ProAroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement.  We will use this and the Zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new Capresso coffeemaker replacement.  Don\u0027t waste your money on this Zojirushi model unless you don\u0027t care about taste.  It was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned.  Even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine\n",
    "\nEveryone has already covered the basics, so here\u0027s the highlights:\n\nThe audio listening quality is poor, especially for 40mm drivers (which normally sound good with strong bass response).  This is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal, since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad.\n\nThe headphones are heavy, which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position.  They slide very easily off the head, and apply a lot of downward force on the ears.  I have a big head, and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure, now they don\u0027t slide off, but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use.\n\nAt first, the volume slider is stiff, but then becomes smooth.\n\nAfter 4 months of use, the mute switch is getting loose, I don\u0027t expect it to work 4 months from now.\n\nI really like the microphone portion of the headset, the angle is adjustable, and the volume is loud and clear.\n\nIn the end, these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones.  Next time, I\u0027d grab the cheaper Logitech headset, where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears, not some large outer pad\n",
    "\nI purchased this unit not for gaming, but for making PC to PC calls.  Here are my observations:\n\nPros:  \n1. Sound quality of the microphone on the receiving end is reported by my friends and family as exceptionally clear.  Certainly much better than what you\u0027d get out of a webcam.\n2. Chord is robust and long.  Easily fits over my long desk to my CPU that rests beneath.\n3. Controls are easy to use, although the mic on/off switch doesn\u0027t click into place like I\u0027d expect it to.  It just slides back and forth.  I can see people accidentally turning it off.\n4. Headphones produce good sound, although nothing extraordinary.\n5. The mic itself freely rotates, so you can position it however you desire.\n\nCons:\n1. First and foremost, if you\u0027ve got a small head DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!!  My head is not big and these headphones ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE!  These headphones are so large that they\u0027re actually uncomfortable.  Their entire weight rests on my ears and I can\u0027t wear them for very long without my ears falling off.\n\n2.  These headphones are very heavy, uncomfortably so.  I\u0027ve resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears.\n\n3.  Perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler, but it still feels like I\u0027m wearing a set of insulated ear muffs.  Chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until I\u0027m dying of heat exhaustion.\n\n4. You need to get a Y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time. If you don\u0027t have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue.  Otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again.  Y splitters are only a few dollars but it\u0027s an accessory you will have to purchase, especially since front speaker ports on most computers can\u0027t be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack (and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one). Granted, this is more of a general microphone/headset combo issue than anything Logitek related, but if this is your first microphone/headset purchase then you should be aware of this problem.  I use onboard audio instead of a sound card, so I don\u0027t have multiple output jacks.\n\n5. These headphones are designed to rest behind your neck, not over the top of your head.  Unfortunately, the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back, placing all the weight on your ears.  The plastic beam is also too short (and just!) to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit.\n  \n6. The design also doesn\u0027t make sense.  The beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck, yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head.  It\u0027s pretty uncomfortable.  If the headset was adjustable it would be fine!  The earpieces are just too huge!\n\nOverall I\u0027m disappointed with these.  If you\u0027re under 5\u002710\" I say go with another model.  The hardware works great, but the design is terrible.  I\u0027m returning these and purchasing an uglier, but more functional, set of smaller headphones\n",
    "\nThe headset sits on the back of head, which is ok, however due to large ear rests it feals awkward and uncomfortable. I was not able to use volume control, as the headphones were only audible at higher volume level.\n\nThe mic is poor.  Whether you want it for gaming or just general purpose use, its better to skip this for something else\n",
    "\nI have been using the Palmone Navigator with my TX for about eight weeks.  Most of my comments are based on a comparison with the built-in navigation system in my Lexus.  \n\nSoftware installation is fairly easy.  However, you need at least a 256 MB SD card to load more than a couple of states; I recommend a 1 or 2 GB card.  \n\nWhile the concept of a TX doubling as a navigation device is intriguing, the realty of it is rather sobering.  It is a cool toy, but if you have to plan routes for your job or any other meaningful purpose, this is NOT the right product.  \n\nThe pros are:\n - Inexpensive in comparison to built-ins und stand-alone products\n - Unit can be used in different locations and cars and even while walking\n - One device serves multiple purposes\n\nThe cons are:\n - It can take up to several minutes after starting the unit to acquire a satellite signal.  This is not the case with my car\u0027s OEM navigation system.\n - The maps are outdated and not as precise as the OEM nav system:  I live in Phoenix, AZ and my neighborhood (built seven years ago) as well as most of the freeways I take to work and back don\u0027t exist on the software.  More recent updates are not available (I checked the Tomtom website).\n - Navigation is often not precise enough (e.g. it tells me to make a left in 50 yards, when I have already passed the intersection where it wants me to make a left).  I never have this problem with the built-in navigation.\n - Look-up function for addresses and phone numbers is clumsy and doesn\u0027t display actual address until you map it.\n - It tends to freeze at least a couple times a day, requiring a soft reset.  \n - Lost connections to the satellite receiver or lost satellite signals also tend to disrupt the navigation on longer trips with stops.\n\nOverall, the unit is too unreliable to be used as your only navigational aid.  If you need navigation to get to your travel destination, you are better off with a stand-alone unit.  I truly wish I had better things to say about this device since I really like the concept, but the reality just doesn\u0027t match the marketing.\n\n",
    "\nThe GOOD news is that this is a full featured GPS solution that is easy to mount in the car and can navigate to contacts in your address book. Maps are detailed and the POI (Point of Interest) database is fairly extensive.\n\nThe BAD news is that it all too often fails to connect via Bluetooth. Installation of software and maps is error prone (do not follow any of the \u0027advanced\u0027 hints in the manual - they scrambled my SD card). \n\nOnly buy this product if you like puzzle solving and have a great deal of patience. If you are expecting an out of the box solution that is 100% reliable - look elsewhere.\n",

    "\nFor over eight years (nearly 9), I had an Acer 17\" CRT \u0026 loved it. I use a KVM to switch computers, \u0026 the CRT kept all of my adjustments for that computer, every time.\nWhen it started showing signs of age (about four months ago), I decided to try a flat screen, or LCD, though I\u0027ve heard horror stories about them, my laptop is great.\n\nI don\u0027t mind the dark overlay associated w/LCDs, I have that on my laptop. I was amazed at how poorly this monitor responds to things. I still swap computers.

If you change the refresh rate, the monitor changes, not the computer. What happened to dumb monitors (what happened to dumb printers)? Best, should be a button (turn on) away. Some tweaking isn\u0027t bad.\n\nFade out: I have the monitor, at the \"proper\" height, \u0026 the upper \u0026 lower corners fade. As looking at any lcd from an angle.\nYou can\u0027t tilt this monitor very much at all\n\nDon\u0027t spend much time on shut down or re-start in ME, the lines \u0026 jaggies will kill you.\n\nI\u0027m sorry that I bought this monitor. The refesh rate for games, is fair. Don\u0027t play any games prior to ME! Because ME era games fade badly at the ends, nearly blacking out. Post XP isn\u0027t anything to write home about really.\n\nI would suggest trying out an hdtv first. With a direct (vga) plug in. It\u0027s a few dollars more, but if you\u0027re considering an hdtv, as well as a monitor, I\u0027d chance it. You can always buy a 20\" CRT for less.\n\nI hope this helps\n",
    "\nThe keyboard with this set is flimsy and cheap feeling.  \n\nWorse, the layout is nonstandard: they\u0027ve messed up the key cluster above the arrows (Insert/Delete/Home/End/etc.).  And the right hand Ctrl is not below the right end of the Shift key, it is under the left end of the Shift key, where one of the Windows keys (the context menu one) normally is.  They\u0027ve taken out one of the Windows menu keys, too.  \n\nThe wireless features worked fine (I\u0027ve used it two days) and worked even without installing their driver software (something I\u0027m always reluctant to do).

I generally buy Staples brand photo paper for general photo printing, and it always worked fine with my Epson printer. But my first prints on this printer looked dull and muddy -- like I was looking at the images though a mild but annoying grey/brown haze. So I went out and bought Canon paper instead. The quality was somewhat improved, but still not what I had expected. So yes, I got a printer for under $30, but now to get even passably OK prints, I need to spend a fortune on Canon brand inks and paper. Not much of a bargain.\n",

The bigger band that goes over the top of the head is almost square - flat on top, instead of curved, so the weight all rests right on the crown of my head.\n\n2.

    "\nI can\u0027t say enough positive about Logitech mice.  This device, however, was a dismal disappointment.  The PC interface works well, and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive.  Unfortunately, that in no way translates into a good remote interface.  The ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor, and, for those with video recorder boxes, very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available (if its there at all, its hidden many keystrokes deeper than I care to know about).  Even when reverting to manual operation of individual components, changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes (as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes--a much more irritating trait than one might think).  Overall, for day-to-day functionality I actually consider the barely-programmable remote that came with my Scientific Atlanta DVR vastly superior to the Harmony, which I\u0027ve given up on after only a few days of forced use.\n\nConsidering the ridiculous pricetag, I strongly advise you save yourself a lot of money and your relatives a lot of frustration this year by steering clear of this sad study in user interface failure\n",

Being disappointed with the fit of the Koss phones, I bought the slightly more expensive JVC HA-FX55V.  At least for me, a much better fit, which means more comfort and better sound.

    "\nThis warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200.\n",

Worked fine for two backups, then the drive stopped being recognized by my own or any other computer.

    "\nThe features, size, and design of this unit are what drew me in. But after just a few uses, I quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive, but completely unusable package. To start with, the unit is small - the smallest of its kind. But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace. Second, the unit has a built-in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed. So, when it crashes, which it does frequently, there is no way to \"cold-boot\" the unit by removing the battery. This is also a problem because it reduces the unit\u0027s true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it. Then, what you have is a paperweight. Oh, and by the way, when you do have it plugged in to charge, the backlight is always on (even if the power is off). So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either.\n\nBut, all of this aside, the firmware simply does not work. It locks up incessantly and, with no way to reboot, you literally have to unplug it, wait for it to auto-power-off, and hope that you can start the machine up again. And, to add insult to injury, the body is a cheap Chinese-made piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones.\n\nOverall, don\u0027t be taken in by the low price. Paying any amount of money is too much for a unit that doesn\u0027t work\n",

I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops.  The wireless access was a \u0027it\u0027s there if I need it\u0027 novelty.  I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online, VPN into work, etc..  This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so.\nThe last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least.  I logged on my first day and lost connection 5-6 times browsing MSN and Yahoo.  At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11.  I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways, and changed the channel..  I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used.  I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed, 95% signal strength. The connection is still getting dropped randomly.  Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength.  No difference.  Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software.. theres my router, 97% signal strength @ 54Mbs.  unplugged router, modem, repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP, rebooted PC.  I turned on my modem first until is was ready to go, then the router until it was ready, and then my PC (as per the netgear website)and yea, no difference in the connections stability.  The conection is still getting dropped randomly.  \nI might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered.

I also already advised some friends to buy that device.\nAs a good point for Amazon, the very fast answer when I requested the replacement of the device. \nI will come back with updates after I receive the replacement. Hope a good one next time.\nThank you Amazon Team.\n\nComing back after receiving the replacement device.\nFirst of all it was a very good idea buying Amazon fulfilled products even it was a bit more expensive than other sellers. The replacement came faster than the product. Excellent Amazon Team and very professional. It\u0027s a pleasure doing business with you.\nThe device works perfectly. \nReally a device you must have. \nMore than that, my friends I recommended the mp3 player are very happy with their new acquisition.  They were luckier than me. \n5 Stars for the product now.\n",

    "\nI had a D-link USB adaptor before which was really good, but was old.  I upgraded to a wireless G Linksys USB adaptor, but I was supplied with old goods (a Linksys sales manager confirmed that), so I sent that back.  I thought I\u0027d try D-Link again.  Bad move.  First, I tried to upgrade the drivers.  My current version was 1.0.5.0.  I downloaded the version 1.12 from D-Link\u0027s site.  After uninstalling and reinstalling (several times) I still had 1.0.5.0.  An hour and a half on the phone with D-Link tech support and I still had 1.0.5.0.  Another hour on Google, and I\u0027m not the only one with this issue.  Seems to be a version-control issue with D-Link.  Then, even more irritating, every time after I use my wired connection and go back to wireless I have to reinstall the drivers and reboot.  And re-enter all my security info again.  (I believe this has something to do with using a different USB port from the last time, but whatever the reason, it\u0027s unacceptable).  This adaptor\u0027s going back too.

The computer seemed to work for a while or at least had few errors when I first used it but I guess that was when I had windows 98 for 2 years. When I upgraded to windows XP it just got terrible I had frequent blue screens and errors. I thought it was my video card or my ram or Irq sharing tried all that didn\u0027t seem to be it.  Eventually I was wrong it was this card as mentioned before by others apparently it does not like some amount of internet use and when the card gets stuck it shuts down and windows xp just says error or points to the video card or irq sharing ot page fault in non page area as the problem.  The card was the problem buy another card other than fa310,fa311 the one I have and fa312 even if you have intel or something else I would not waist my money on this card it will probably give you problems down the road.

    "\nI have a G4 tower Mac that did have a built in Ethernet.  Unfortunately, a lightening strike took out the port and I was forced to get a PCI card to replace the port.  The first card I bought was the D-Link DFE-530TX+.  I was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with Macs and that the \"minimum requirement\" was OS 10.2.\n\nThey lied.  OS 10.2 is the _maximum_ for this card.  For most people, it won\u0027t work with 10.3 and up.  D-Link has no driver for 10.3 or higher, only 10.2.  A google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with 10.3.  I couldn\u0027t.  I tried several different drivers (some users recommended a driver from Realtek) and none worked.\n\nIt\u0027s my guess (and totally a guess) that this card is really only for older Macs that are limited to 10.2.  D-Link doesn\u0027t seem to have any intention of supporting modern Macs.\n\nThis is the second D-Link product I\u0027ve used (the first was a cable modem) and I\u0027ve been disappointed both times.

I\u0027m sure they pre-formatted this card to appear like it\u0027s 2 gigabytes, but what a surprise when you start using it. Not good\n",

    "\nThese radios look nice but there are some problems here. First the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk. Second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands. The receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times.

Maybe this thing works ok to \"charge\" while the iPod is not playing, but it is not an acceptable way to \"power\" the iPod while it is playing. \n",
    "\nI commute via public transportation, the majority of that on a noisy train. Earbuds and over ear headphones don\u0027t block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music. I received these Philips HN110 headphones as a gift. \n\nWhen I first got these I was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared. I have some KOSS over ear head phones which are nice and beefy. These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space. They use a single AAA batt. Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I\u0027m not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don\u0027t have this. \n\nI also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified. \n\nAfter about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside. Now I can\u0027t open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones. I checked Philips website for info on these phones but I couldn\u0027t find any. I called their customer support and they told me I had to call a different #. I called the different number and got the Return Merchandise Authorization # but was told I need to send the receipt in. I got them as a gift so I don\u0027t have the receipt. \n\nIn summary, their noise cancelling ability is pretty week. Better than my hefty non-noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10% or so (just to put a number in their). Flimsy design. Cords from both earphones. Hear the wind amplified. Battery compartment latch broke after a month and a half and their warrenty sucks\n",
    "\nAfter only having the cable for a week under very light usage, the cable stopped working intermittently. It makes crackling noises when the cable is moved. I am not talking about whipping or quick movement, just gentle movement of the cable causes crackling and loss of signal. I was about to scrap the cable altogether but I decided to resolder the connector to see if that would help. I cut off about half a foot of the cable and resoldered it, only to find that the same problem persisted. I got a bad cable, obviously..\n",

    "\nI bought the TDK Mojo 256 about a year and 3 months ago. It worked wonderfully for the first year - did what it was supposed to and the radio quality was great. Then I upgraded to Windows XP and that\u0027s when everything started going wrong. This MP3 player needs propreitary software to copy files from your hard disk or CD to the mp3 player. Unfortunately the software doesn\u0027t work well at all with XP. Right now, my player is piece of junk. I have tried copying files which it shows as copied but then when you reconnect the player, they don\u0027t show up on there. What\u0027s more, formatting the internal memory will also not release the space and so I have the internal memory full but it shows up in the software as free. However, it won\u0027t copy over any new files and gives me a \"Storage Full\" error. It doesn\u0027t act reliably with XP either and I had to unplug and replug several times for it to even read the list of songs on the mp3. It lasted all of 15 months. While it sounds like a great deal ( good features for price ). DO NOT buy this if you will be using it with XP and if you do, please don\u0027t expect it to last more than 12-15 months\n",
    "\nThis player is a piece of junk.\nFirst the USB really doesnt mean you can hot swap. You can access the files only if the software is installed on the computer which means that you cannot pick up MP3 from any computer.\nSecond, it gives errors with XP. It tries  to install drivers every time.\nTHird, removing old and adding new MP3 is such a hassle. It takes minutes to delete old files and add new. Seems like you are working with a floppy.\nFourth, its Mojo software hangs all the time.\nFifth, it sucks battery life.\nSixth, if your MP3 is not in a directory, i.e. if copied directly, it wont show. Then it wont delete and will show 200 MB as not free space. Formatting is the only way out.\nSeventh, it came with a mail in rebate which never showed up.\nOverall, a bad experience\n",
    "\nDoes the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say \"up to 40 objects per hole\" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn\u0027t think was important.\nNow the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn\u0027t good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO\n",
    "\nYou don\u0027t have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals.  Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel?  There\u0027s no gold inside!  So there\u0027s no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables.   If you don\u0027t believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie.  Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.\n\nWith analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope).\n",
    "\nHave you ever heard the saying that something would cost you \"an arm and a leg\"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don\u0027t get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they\u0027re just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.\n\nSeveral people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there\u0027s really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you\u0027d see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.\n\nBut Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that\u0027s worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn\u0027t just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn\u0027t doubt if they\u0027re certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you\u0027re looking at the right cables.\n\nBut for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You\u0027ll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\n",
    "\nWhat do they say about fools and money?\n\nHDMI uses TMDS which is a digital transmission system with built-in error correction. TMDS has been designed to work over cheap cabling and a $10 HDMI cable will meet the specification. If you spend 9 times more on this cable than another one then you have just wasted $80. That\u0027s all there is to it. \n\nYou don\u0027t need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable. The picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a $90 cable over a $10. In fact the signal is identical. Let me repeat - HDMI (\u0026 DVI-D) devices talk digitally with error correction. This cable and ones like it are for suckers only.\n",

A number of even the most favorable ones mentioned this annoyance.\n\nThe manufacturer replaced the first unit after I complained, but it was no improvement.

    "\nI have to say, since I really started listening to music I have payed attention to a lot more detail of sound.  With that said I am not a bass junky; but bass and compression of the overall mix is what makes a sound a good sound.  I currently owned a pair of Sony MDR-EX81LP (that cost me 30-40 dollars a year ago) I am a medical student and I study all day and all night, but cannot have my music blasting.  Conversely I needed to have a nice isolation of my sound.  Comparing my old Sony to the new ER-6 that I just got, I am EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED with their performance.  I was expecting a great sound with minimal noise from the outside and get almost no response at the level that I studied with my old ear buds. To be fair remember that these are not noise cancelling, they are noise reducing.  There is no component involved here, they are basically really good earplugs with speakers in them.  My wife just ran the vacuum and I barely heard it.  The earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable; however my other ones (Sony earbuds) sound better.  A combination of the two would be great.  Keep in mind that this is my opinion and make your own based on why you are buying earbuds.  Environmental sound reduction is great, sound quality is not as good as some others.....choose your fault and pay attention to pricing. \n",

    "\nI am sorry to say that my experience with the CD player has been miserable. After a series of unhelpful conversations with SONY folks, I am going to return it. It often fails to read the CD or cuts in and out on new CDs that play perfectly in other CD players; the shuffle program simply spins and spins, and rarely settles down to actually play a CD.  It occasionally generates a read error message (uh, yeah...).\n\nEven if on \"continuous\" play, it often fails to recognize the CDs loaded into it. Instead, it displays a \"No Disc\" message. Then, even if it does play a series of CDs on continuous play, at some pt, it just stops. It has been like this since I first brought it home and has not improved in the weeks since. \n  \nThe experience with the tech support people alone convinced me that they do not care.  It took a long time to even get through their tech support lines the first night I had it, and then a lot of persuading to even get them to agree that their CD player was not working. Then they tried to convince to me send the brand new machine back, **for a price**, to have them repair it. Uh, no, not likely to fall for that--paying them to repair a brand new machine straight out of the box, taking time out of my way-too-busy life to ship it to them??  I finally have a reference number with permission to return it to the store for a full refund; so back it goes.\n \nThen there are the limitations on the remote control that others here have noted. \n\nSince I had the same shuffle problems with my previous SONY carousel player, I am not inclined to try a 3rd machine. \n\nNeedless to say, no more SONYs are coming into my life.\n \n",

    "\nThis may be one of the cheapest routers out there, but it\u0027s cheap in every way. I spent hours either on hold or talking with poorly trained overseas \"tech support\" whose expertise consisted of (barely) reading a script. Eventually these computer whizzes determined that my D-Link router didn\u0027t work. They told me to send it back (on my nickel, of course), and they sent me another one, which also did not work, at least not with my computer system. After more wasted hours, I was referred to the one guy at D-Link who--supposedly--has mastered this router\u0027s bugs. The problem? He never answered the phone. And despite all my calls to him and all my voicemails asking him either to call me at work or to set a time for us to talk, he repeatedly returned my calls at 3:00 in the afternoon, the time when most people who can afford routers are working. Finally I had an epiphany: Life was too short to %*\u0026#@ with D-Link. I packed up the router and sent it back to the CEO, Stephen Joe, with a letter.

    "\nThis review is more about my several month\u0027s experience with XM satellite radio and the not-so-good quality using the wireless FM frequencies through our car\u0027s radios. I live in Los Angeles.\n\nI got this little Roady XT for me, and the XM2GO radio receiver for my wife. I was excited about getting these new satellite receivers in our cars. The Idea of having all these \"no ads\" radio stations playing through my car\u0027s FM frequency seemed cool. \n    Setting up the unit and getting it to work was easy. Changing FM frequencies for the wireless transmitter is easy as well. It really is a neat little receiver. \n\nHowever, after setting up this unit in my car and the XM2GO in my wife\u0027s car, I was really disappointed in the music sound quality. The music sounds flat and with a hissy quality, almost monaural at times, and the volume seems a lot lower than the car\u0027s radio at the same volume setting. I had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio. The car\u0027s regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers, IMO. Besides, there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on XM radio as someone mentioned in another review.\n    \nI thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and I wouldn\u0027t have to use the poor sounding wireless FM technology, but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and I didn\u0027t want the vehicle\u0027s factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car\u0027s dash and accidentally messed something up.\n\nSo about two month\u0027s ago, after several months of off-and-on use of XM radio service, I called to cancel my subscriptions. I had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when I joined. As I expected would happen, when I called them to cancel, I was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service rep. Finally, I got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so I could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their \"special\" customer service department for cancellations where I was \"accidentally\" disconnected and had to call back and start all over again.\n\nFinally, after another long call to them, I was able to cancel my service.....or, so I thought. Yesterday, I was looking at my September credit card bill and saw that XM radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed. \n\nI called my bank and had them reverse the charges and I may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case XM tries to charge me again six months from now.\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I\u0027ve taken them out for vacation use in camera, I\u0027ve had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later, I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day, having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.\n\nAfter missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries, I\u0027d had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin, and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them.\n",
    "\nI got these batteries just over a few months ago for my portable GPS unit that I use often on my travels. In fact, I bought eight of them (two packs of 4). I was upgrading from my previous set of 1600mAh Rayovac NiMH AA batteries that were still going strong after 2 years. When I saw the new energizer 2500mAh rechargeables I was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old 1600mAh Rayovacs.  Boy was I wrong!\n\nFor 2-3 months, the 2500mAh energizers worked well. A charge lasted about 6-7 hours in my portable GPS unit. I was getting roughly 5.5-6 hours on my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA\u0027s. My GPS unit is spec\u0027ed for 6 hours on a pair of AA\u0027s so the new 2500mAh energizers seemed to work flawlessly.\n\nNow they work okay and seem to be getting worse each time I charge them, appearing to hold less of a charge each time.  For the last month or two (4th \u0026 5th month after their initial purchase) I\u0027ll be lucky if I can get 4-5 hours of use out of them in my portable GPS unit. I now get roughly 3.5-4 hours of use out of them.  I pulled out and tried my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA\u0027s and once again got approximately 5.5-6 hours of use out of them in my GPS unit - and my trusty Rayovacs are just over 2 years old!\n\nI thought I might have had some defective energizers but I can\u0027t seem to get any pair of combinations to hold a decent charge. Charges just don\u0027t seem to last - it\u0027s really disappointing.  I am going to look at another brand for high capacity 2500+ mAh NiMH batteries to replace my 1600mAh Rayovacs. Would be great if the energizer could hold its charge. But because they don\u0027t, I do not recommend the energizers to anyone\n",

    "\nI bought the Zboard and was sorely disappointed in it\u0027s playbility, efficiency and value for several reasons:\n\n-The left buttons, which are the feature of the keyboard, are based on a mirroring system.  You experience keyboard lag at times because the board has to interpret the button presses based on the zboard program, then the game.  I personally had to press some buttons twice, or even three times in order for that command to register.\n\n-The left buttons cannot be configured to your game, you must configure the game to it.  The templates for different games cannot be modified, all it does is change the button configuration.  There are no patches for configuring the keys to how you want it.\n\n-According to the website, the top buttons for media can only be used with windows media player.  If you use winamp, itunes, or anything else it wont work.  \n\n-You cannot program any macros into any of the buttons.  If you are looking for a keyboard that can autofire or program keystrokes this isn\u0027t it.  \n\n- The numpad is configured differently than a normal keyboard.  This can actually be a good thing if you like having a compacted pad.  I found it frustrating since I put attack commands on the numbers, and would press the wrong one sometimes because of the layout.\n\nI experienced a lot of frustration with this controller while pvping in world of warcraft.  The top buttons on the left side of the board give you access to a bigger arsenal of spells and abilities when programmed right.  The problem is remembering how zboard configured the button layout.  I would constantly get wailed on because a button wasn\u0027t where I originally remembered it to be.  This forced me to sit in the key bindings menu to configure the buttons to where I could remember.  After completely revamping my bindings, I gave up, restored my defaults, and used a regular keyboard instead.\n\nThere is nothing gaming enhancing about this keyboard beyond having an accessory on the left side that looks cool because the buttons are grey and red and contoured to your hand.  \n\nTo achieve the same effect as the zboard, turn your current keyboard slightly to the right and enjoy.\n\n",

If one wants to keep the insert regardless of whether or not the \"cut offs\" are present it would be best if the paper was inserted within the opposite position in the paper tray in the printer so one can cut to the size needed.\n\nOtherwise, I would suggest what another Amazon customer has done. Use cardstock paper....at least for the back inserts.  And trim with either a scissors or paper cutter.\n\nA product should do what it promises it will do.  Unfortunately, this one does not.

    "\nI logged 870 miles with the iway 350.  270 miles around maryland it was / is a great item. I took it on our first trip to New York and Long Island and it was terrible. The first problem occurred on the New Jersey turnpike. I was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat. The unit said I was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway. However when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more. It said I was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70, and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere. I even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job. It did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 + miles from when it acted up. We even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again. About 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again. Then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going. We often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit. Then on the trip from the Bronx to Long Island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating. I had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone. However about 1 mile from their place it started working again. We used it on long island with no trouble at all. Then on  trip back to the Bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions. Then on our way back from the Bronx to long Island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating . The same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the Bronx. On our way back to Maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions. I did update the software to the new 1.2.0 days before we took the trip.  \n\nAlso charting the 212 mile course to the Bronx NY took close to 20 minutes, then the extra destination to Long Island a 30 mile addition took the Iway 350 30 or so more minutes. I figured with all that time the trip home calculations would be faster but I fell asleep after waiting  over a hour for it to complete the task. I feel this is one issue the unit has. Longer trips take so long to calculate so when it thinks your off track it takes forever to chart a new course. On short runs under 20 miles it was very fast.\n\nI returned the unit and got a Garmin C530. The C530 is a very nice unit fast in every respect.\n",
    "\nThe 350C is well packaged with almost current programming. It only got me lost eleven (11) times on a 865 mile trip:All cities in Georgia - Tybee Island to Pine Mountain to Newnan to Stone Mountain and return to Tybee Island. (I packed and returned the unit the day after getting home.) It may suit others well, but I can not rely on the unit. Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences. (One wrong turn took me sixty miles out of the way.)Two were for unknown reasons. The unit seems to take forever to acquire available satellites. Instructions are clear, but preferred views automatically switch to \"Map\" even when not wanted. I need a faster reacting unit that allows programming while enroute to a destination (by a passanger, of course.\n",

Unfortunalty the unit wouldn\u0027t hold a charge on the battery.  So I returned it for another one.  It worked for one week and then I had the same exact problem.  Which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units.  When I tried to return this unit, the unit I was given didn\u0027t work at all, it gave me an error message when the GPS booted up.  Unfortunaltey the vendor I purchased it from didn\u0027t have any more units that I could exchange it for.  So I called customer service and got an RAN.

    "\nI bought this since it\u0027s economical, compact, didn\u0027t need cabling (although it has an extension if you need it), advertised a whopping 108 mbps. Well so much for that:\n\n1) Drivers are problematic and causes conflicts with XP SP2.  My first ever blue screen of death in about 3 or more years running XP came this item\n\n2) It is EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE:\n\n- already mentioned repeatedly, it overheats\n\n- it drops connections randomly and yes, the only way to re-acquire the signal is to unplug and plug back in\n\n- It\u0027s utility is worthless, just install the driver (if you can). If you try using WPA, forget about using this utility, just use Windows to configure it. \n\n- I\u0027ve also found out that it\u0027s better if you just remove this utility from the STARTUP (don\u0027t run it at all) so that Windows can do everything it needs to connect, which is faster and more reliable. Be careful not to UNINSTALL, since it will also remove the driver...just remove it from your Windows Startup folder list. Netgear has an FAQ about this problem, but I\u0027m not going to tweak Windows and risk more stuff for this cheap piece of hardware.\n\n3) 108 MBPS? Yeah right. You\u0027ll need the RIGHT KIND OF access point/wireless router for this, if not, it\u0027s 54 mbps. This was one of the selling points, but it\u0027s definitely a \"gotcha\".

    "\nAll HDMI cables are created equal...well, yes and no.  While the signal is 100% digital (which means that $20 \u0026 $150 cables give the exact same picture quality), it doesn\u0027t mean that each HDMI cable type gives the same rejection of noise (signal to noise ratio) as other HDMI cables.\nI\u0027ve had this cable a few weeks now, and am consistently getting digital \"dropouts\" every now and again (only that part of the image looks scrambled for a few seconds) -- very annoying while the action is in the scrambled section.  Went out and bought the Monster HDMI cable (not exactly cheap, though...) -- the Monster cable gives the exact same picture quality as this cable, except the Monster cable did not experience the digital \"dropouts\".\nIf you don\u0027t mind seeing the dropouts every now and again, this is a great cable.  If you want a picture that doesn\u0027t experience any dropouts, get the Monster cable.  Regardless, the picture quality is the exact same between the cables (minus the dropouts)\n",

    "\nThe DVD burner connected very easily through USB, was immediately recognized by WinXP, the software installation was fine. I was beginning to feel good. However, whenever I burned a DVD (I tried 4 different brands, some R, some RW etc...), several files would contain errors, and would be completely unreadable. The burning process moreover does not detect this: one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors. Moreover, the firmware update just does not work on my machine, pardon, machineS. Completely standard Dell machines, all latest WinXP and drivers, good CPUs (3Ghz and up), lots of memory, big hard-drives. I called customer service to try to solve the problem. First of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes. The rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing. To make a long story short, I had to call 3 times. First guy: oh, \"of course it doesn\u0027t work, you have EasyCD creator installed!\". Ok, I buy it, I go through the (painful) uninstallation process of Roxio\u0027s software. No problems solved. Second guy: \"Oh, of course it does not work, it requires 10Gb of free hard-drive space! It\u0027s written on the box\". Plain lie: on the box it says you need 10Gb for NeroVision (for burning videos), but only 1Gb for Nero. Quarrel (they are tough!) with the guy who could not care less about the fact I got him lying, or that the product description is wrong. Ok, patiently I freed up 10Gb from hard drive, try again, exactly same problem. The only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement. I got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720, not a 710, since 710 is not manufactured anymore (wonder why?). Notice I tried this on two different machines (one laptop and one desktop), with identical results.\nOther lie: I noticed, as somebody else here, that the Nero software provided writes only on Sony drives: so if Nero is really the only software that should be installed because of conflicts with Roxio (et al.?), you will never be able to use your own CD drive to burn CDs. How ridicolous is that???? The technician said this is because I had both software(s) installed, but that was another lie.\nThe incompetence of these guys is beyond belief. If the new drive will not work, I hopefully will get a refund through my credit card. You know, the technician even said that that is not possible, credit cards companies do not do that (LOL)\n",
    "\nI am on my third drive now, thanks to the first two breaking. Sony sent me the 720UL as a replacement for my 710UL, but it\u0027s the same drive with the exception of some faster burn times and the 720UL doesn\u0027t support MAC OS.\n\nThe Sony Service Center in Manning, IA gave me a huge runaround... first they agreed to pay for return shipping on the second defective drive. Then they called me back 2 hours later and refused to pay for the shipping. What a joke.\n\nGood drive when it works, but may god have mercy on you if it breaks after the return period.\n",

    "\nI had this adapter running in my the Cardbus slot of my Windows 98 computer and it ran fine. I installed it on my Windows 2000 laptop. Well, my first sign of trouble was a warning popup when I installed the drivers that the drivers were not certified by Microsoft. So, imagine my shock when my brand new computer constantly got Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crashes. Big blue screen, loss of data, computer freezes tight, power button inoperative, and when you have to use a pin to press that tiny little laptop reset button on a brand new computer, well, we all know that\u0027s when you\u0027re in Computer Hell.\n\nI\u0027m a Microsoft Certified Professional so I was able to narrow down the source of the problem. After definitely identifying the FA511 as the culprit, I contacted Netgear\u0027s online  tech support. And that\u0027s when things really started to get ugly.\n\nIt took forever for Netgear to finally give me an answer. This was after days of inactivity, wildly inappropriate responses, and repeatedly requesting same information from me.\n\nFinally, Netgear escalated the problem to their next level of tech support and I was shocked to read their solution: \"This is a Windows issue regarding permissions and ***16 BIT*** compatibility mode\" While they were vague as to the exact nature of the problem, and contradicted themselves as to whether compatibility mode had to be enabled or disabled, their solution was straightforward: I was directed to a Microsoft Knowledge Base article which tells you how to enable Compatibility Mode - and for 16-bit compatibility mode I had to make my nice clean Windows 2000 computer compatible with Windows 95 (yes, ninety-five).\n\nSo, while the FA511 hardware is a 32-bit Cardbus adapter, apparently their drivers are 16-bit!!! No wonder the FA511 was never certified for Windows 2000. And I wouldn\u0027t trust it for Windows XP either.\n\nThere are other Ethernet adapters out there by 3COM, Belkin, Linksys, SMC, and Xircom that work flawlessly with Windows 2000/XP by companies that will respond to your questions. Go get them. Avoid the FA511\n",

I can see not including a dock, A/V cables, etc, as those aren\u0027t   essential iPod accessories. But an AC adapter? Come on. Bad Apple. Bad!\n\nOn the plus side, this AC adapter is smaller and comes with an iPod to charger (or iPod to computer) cable, which the previous model did not include. It\u0027s still a ripoff, though\n",
    "\nI have been a DVR user through Cox Cable for approx. 1 yr, and have always been disappointed.  I have kept my eye on Tivo for some time, and when my DVR box went out for the 2nd time, I decided it was time to try Tivo.  I got a refurbished Series2 DVR that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $12.95 per month. \n\nI received the Tivo only 2 days after I ordered, very impressive since I didn\u0027t pay to have it shipped that quickly.  The setup was reasonably straight forward.  I had heard so much about Tivo that I had very high expectations, and here are the problems I encountered that surprised me:\n\n1)  My first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a Dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs (DVR does this automatically).  So I ordered the wrong unit.  To be honest, I don\u0027t see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner, my family relies on dual tuners A LOT.  I am shocked that Tivo even offers a single tuner system, to me it\u0027s like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed, a dual tuner is so much more useful.  \n\n2)  I thought I would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network.  No, you have to buy theirs for $40 to $50.  Since I didn\u0027t know that, I had to rely on the phone line option.  This really stinks, it is very very very slow.  I spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming, the system kept getting interuppted during download (yes I disabled call waiting).  \n\n3)  When you use the online program guide, it covers up the entire screen.  My Cox DVR puts the TV in upper right corner (approx. 1/4) asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide.  We use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on, but that won\u0027t work so well with Tivo.  Plus, scrolling up and down is painfully slow, the screen takes for ever to refresh.\n\n4)  Similarly to item 3 above, when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely, you can only see the Tivo guide.  Again, Cox DVR lets me look at my list and delete files etc.. all while my TV program stays visible in the upper right corner.  \n\n5)  Remote wouldn\u0027t work with my 42\" Akai plasma.  I can\u0027t fault Tivo too much on this one, none of the universal remotes seem to work with this TV for some reason.  \n\n\nI did love some of the Tivo features and wish my Cox DVR had them:\n1)  Wishlist\n2)  Tivo Suggestions\n3)  Can access your Tivo through internet\n4)  View photo\u0027s through Tivo.\n\nIn the end my items # 3 and 4 were things I just couldn\u0027t get past, so I returned my Tivo.  They were friendly and helpful and I really wanted to like this product, but in my opinion it\u0027s not able to compete with the speed and power of the Cable companies DVR. \n",

    "\nI initially chose this router because of its low price. Sometimes, you get what you pay for, and that is exactly what happened to me. As a wired router, this works well enough. It connects four computers to the internet. Just don\u0027t do anything to intense with it, and you should be fine. I noticed that when I view video media, the connection totally freezes. But for basic internet and downloading, it works.\n\nI generally find, however, that no one buys a \"wireless\" router not to use wireless, and that is where the problem is. The receiver is so painfully finicky, it does not keep connections. The configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery. The linksys support team tries to be helpful, but I can\u0027t seem to make this router reliable. It drops reception all the time. Many times my laptop won\u0027t even detect a signal.

Howver, BEFW11S4 has a MAJOR problem, and a rather common one at that. Specifically, it locks up. It does so frequently. I have to unplug the router at least once a day, and frequently twice, to deal with it locking up. Can\u0027t even access the administrator screen, and even hitting the reset button isn\u0027t enough to fix it. Wireless isn\u0027t too useful when you have to physically walk to the unit multiple times a day, is it?\n\nThe problem seems to lie not in the hardware, but in the firmware (the software that runs on the router). If Linksys would release reliable firmware for this router, I\u0027d give it 4-5 stars. But until they resolve the issue that wires down their wireless modem, I can\u0027t possibly justify giving the BEFW11S4 more then two stars\n",

Also there have been reports of complete data loss by others,but I\u0027ve not had that experience - could be I just haven\u0027t been able to GET to my data enough to find out.  Support from Lacie was completely unhelpful (wash your hands and the sensor before swiping which I have already done dozens of times was the only suggestion).  If the drive could be partioned so you could have a secure partition and an easier to access partion, the failure of biometrics would not be so serious, but as is, I would definitely not purchase this again, and I would strongly advise against it unless there is some kind of firmware or other improvement\n",

ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable\n",

At first I thought it was batteries in the remote, so I replaced those a few times. Then I thought the placement of the IR transmitter was off, so I moved it closer to my AV rack. That worked at first, but the problem persisted so I reprogrammed, but to no avail. Eventually I narrowed it down to the remote unit. Even with the remote RIGHT NEXT TO THE IR Transmitter, it now does not work most of the time. Of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room, so standard IR remotes (why do they even make those still????) are out of the question.

    "\nCan\u0027t say much for the video or sound quality, menu options, or anything really, since this thing broke after 2 minutes of watching Monsters, Inc. on DVD.  Playback just froze, the thing stopped recognizing that DVDs were in unless you turned the thing off and then back on again, and after another minute it wouldn\u0027t even start  playing the thing at all, just whirred a lot.\n\nSo, dud\n",

    "\nMy player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had, which ended up rendering it useless (out of warranty).  \n\nHowever, while it worked, I was quite pleased with the player and the included software.  Everything was intutive and ran smoothly (except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden).  I also liked the fact that this player wasn\u0027t bound by iTunes or file format restrictions.\n\nMy only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult (just give me buttons, I know they aren\u0027t sexy but they\u0027re easy and work well).  \n\nI am giving the product 2 stars because, while I liked it, Creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build (being that this is STILL a problem with these players).  For the amount of money that a player like this costs, it should work for at least year\n",
    "\nThis music player was decent: Nice look, controls, and sound. There are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive. There are really good things about this unit; however, the faults are just too great; thus, superseding the great features.\n\nHowever, the reaction to your key pushes, and file search are way too slow. The software is pretty nice, but the bad thing is that it likes to rename your files for you even when you didn\u0027t ask it too. That gets very annoying. For example, I just want the file to be named as is, with no tags, but the Zen software will add tags no matter what, even if it has to put in the word \"unknown\". It also has these strange crashes that makes it hard to have it recover. The worst part about this product is that the earphone jack gets damaged in a few weeks or months -- unprovoked!\n\nIt was so frustrating to think my headphones where damaged, but I switched it up and found out that it was the Zen. Then I read online, and what do you know -- it\u0027s consensus, the product is faulty because many other people have experienced the same problem. Some people even found some fixes, and I\u0027ve tried them, but to no avail. But then again, why do I have to fix a fairly new product? \n\nIf you\u0027re going to have a fault when it comes to a music player, you DON\u0027T want it to be a physical issue that renders the player useless!\n\nI\u0027d give it at least three stars as I was quite satisfied with it, but the physical fault with the headphone jack is just too much of negligence to overlook\n",
    "\nI purchased this product and ran home to try it out.  not 5 minutes after plugging it in to my computer, my computer freezes.  I restart and it says my device is malfunctioning.  I manage to get it working for about 5 minutes before it craps out on me again.  I try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network. I\u0027m a network engineer and I am well versed in what I am doing, but this card has given me nothing but trouble. I had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect.  This only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing.  I talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor isn\u0027t supported, which is total BS and just an attempt to get out of supporting me, they wouldn\u0027t even let me return the product.  My advice: go with linksys or d-link or SMC, ANYONE but netgear\n",
    "\nSeveral reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace  a composite (L/R audio + video) cable, or an S-video (multi-pinned plug). ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable\n",

It also hangs on to stereo mode on weak signals with no blend or rolloff, you hear audio tones from the stereo decoder PLL losing lock from the station 19 KHz pilot tone.  AM section is not bad, but the FM selectivity is not good enough to block alternate stations that most of my other radios deal with just fine.  Volume steps are so small it takes forever to change, needs a flippin\u0027 crank on the knob.  \n\nDon\u0027t buy this steaming turd.....buy a no-name China box, then you can throw it away when it claps out without feeling like you got scammed.       \n",

    "\nAs others have reported, my latch broke as well, but I broke it within three days of ownership.  Within a month, I cracked the bit of plastic that is supposed to hold the palm in place when I was removing it from the case to sync it.  At the time, the case had so many gashes and dings that it really looked unpresentable.  Bought a Rhinoskin to replace this.  Look elsewhere before you purchase this one\n",
    "\nOK, so it protects the TX on a fall, however the latching mechanism depends on a thin piece of plastic that eventually breaks, rendering the case without anyway of remaining shut on its own.\n\nReplacing this with something like the BoxWave.com hardcase, availab le from Amazon\n",
    "\nI purchased the case along with my new Palm TX to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it. It\u0027s a metal shell with a molded plastic liner. The little plastic catch in the lid half, which keeps the case closed, never seemed to work quite correctly, requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut. On a trip on March 3rd, this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away. Now it has no catch to keep it closed. Since the case cost me about $24 new and I\u0027d only get about half price for the return, I figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return. I\u0027ll use a rubber band around the case, reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is. Save your money and don\u0027t buy this case. I don\u0027t remember reading the reviews before I ordered it -- so there\u0027s a $24 lesson\n",

I should have waited before buying it, though ... on my last visit to an Apple dealership, they had a bin full of *just the ToughSkins,* for sale at a discount. When I asked about these, I was told, \"The belt clips break, and customers bring the ToughSkins back.\"\n\nI should note I\u0027m very careful with my IPod and accessories. I\u0027m not rough on them. The clip just fell apart while I was walking down the street. Given other comments about the flimsy clips, this is clearly a design issue that Speck Products needs to address\n",
    "\nFirst off, I bought this headset for gaming, which anyone who enjoys the pastime will tell you how quickly the hours can melt away. Gamers are dependant on an ultra comfortable pair of headphones that we shouldn\u0027t be able to feel. I have been searching high and low for the Holy Grail of comfort and I was certain paying $90+ for a \"gaming\" headset would be the end of my search. Sorry, these guys are going back.\n\nI\u0027ve tried a couple \"cheap\" Best-Buy headsets that I found painful to wear after an hour or so. Then I decided to spring for \"top of the line\". I wore these for 15 minutes before it became obvious this headset was not the Holy Grail I\u0027ve been looking for.\n\nThe headset itself feels flimsy and cheap. The padding is made of an itchy fabric, and even on my small head, it feels tight. The earphones do not cover my ears and I can feel them slowly being crushed. I\u0027m not impressed with the sound, but I could overlook that if they were comfortable to wear. I didn\u0027t even bother to try the mic.\n\nIf this is how Sennheiser makes their high end gaming equipment, I think it\u0027s safe to say I will avoid these guys in the future. The $30 pair of Aiwa\u0027s I wear at work are more comfortable than this and sound the same... if only that pair had a mic.\n\n*My ears still feel uncomfortable after taking the set off and then writing this review- I couldn\u0027t imagine wearing them for a few hours while gaming. If I find the perfect pair I\u0027ll let you all know\n",

I bought these headphones because my Sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory Creative Zen Micro headphones.  I found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs.  I\u0027ve noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings.  It\u0027s good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise.  I like the around the neck feature.  As far as quality, the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it.  As far as the performance of the headphones, I\u0027m really disappointed in these headphones.  My factory Creative headphones had out performed these.  The bass level is too low even when I max out the bass in the player.  The mids and treble sound like crap. Don\u0027t waste your money on these!  Now I have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones!  argh!\n",

    "\nI actually meant to order the Philips 7-incher (brighter screen, $20 cheaper, bulkier), but somehow I got confused when I placed the order...this one looked beautiful so I was pretty psyched anyway and was definitely going to keep it.  I was planning on using this for work, as I get a lot of DVD\u0027s from clients - so I popped one of those in and guess what?  It came up as \"invalid disc\".  It\u0027s supposed to play the majority of formats, and I triple checked the disc in my other dvd players, and it worked in my Panasonic DVD/VHS combo player.  A store-bought DVD worked fine (although I didn\u0027t play it much more than the first menu) so I know it\u0027s not broken.\n\nThe first reviewer also noticed that it doesn\u0027t play a bunch of homemade DVD\u0027s, so I will confirm that here - if that\u0027s gonna be a deal-breaker for you then stay away.  BTW, the DVD I was trying to play was made on a Philips burner.  I didn\u0027t bother to test it with any others\n",

There is no tension adjustment (already as tight as it would go) and the computer just flopped forward. With a light monitor, I\u0027m sure it would be fine, but don\u0027t expect even close to the stated 25 lb. rating. \n",
    "\nI spent $400 16 months ago on two very similar portable Audiovox DVD players for my kids, for long roadtrips.  They were handled with care, never abused or exposed to severe temperatures.  I think we got about 6 trips out of them, then the screens went blank while in use and both units died within 24 hours of each other.  Circuit City informed me the product is no longer on their shelves and referred me to Audiovox, who will do nothing since the product is now out of warranty.  Extended warranties are useless on this kind of product -- who can wait 6-8 weeks for repairs?  Parents, find another brand\n",
    "\nBought one from Amazon, they sat on the order for a week before shipping a unit that arrived dead. Went through the return/replacement process and they sat on the order for over a week this time and the  that one arrived dead with the exact same failure mode. \n\nThe second one looked as if it had been opened before, accessory bag not sealed, manuals out of place, interior packaging worn. I believe the second one they sent was a return that was then resent to me. Bad news!!!\n\nI still had both and in hope of fixing on, I contacted Garmin who said they were indeed broken and offered to fix one and send it back. This would mean I\u0027d have paid full price for what would then be a refurbished unit.  Both of them returned.\n\nI needed the unit right away for a desert trip. Amazon\u0027s refund process made it such that they\u0027d not refund all of the funds but hold them on account (those that were originally given to me as a gift certificate from my employer). Therefore I could not get the equipment for a local vendor. \n\nI opened one month nearly to the day dealing with slow order processing, bad units, and more. \n\nSo, I\u0027d not recommend the unit and I think Amazon may need to review their own practices to ensure what they have in inventory is new and likely operational, and that when a customer orders something, they put in the effort to ship it ASAP!!\n\nWithout that, if you have to buy one, go to a local dealer, put that batteries in at that shop and have them prove it works before you leave with it. Since you can\u0027t so that here, don\u0027t buy it here. \n",
    "\nMy first GPS. It was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features (ability to save many tracks).

The technology is just not there to cope with either valleys or an overhead canopy. It was handy to confrm where I was when I found a clearing on top of a hill.

I don\u0027t think it has ever left my office and I don\u0027t tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it.  Overall I like these things, but I\u0027m just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit\n",
    "\nI purchased this in the hope that I would be able to record verbal messages to myself, creative thoughts and ideas, etc. It does an adequate job of that. I had also hoped I could use it as a simple player, to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day. This it won\u0027t do, and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the Olympus site that it would not function this way.\n\n First, even though it records wav files, it does not let you handle them well at all. To transfer recordings to your computer, you have to install special software (included), but you cannot transfer wav files back to the recorder (according to the software guide). If you want a recorder/player to function easily like that, you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a USB flash drive (like the Creative Zen series). I did not install the software, as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer. I can record directly to the PC with much higher quality, so why bother? Noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise. It makes more sense to simply repeat anything I record on the Olympus and record it directly to the PC.\n\nSecond, the sound quality is not great. Given that wav files are what are used on CDs, one would expect more than what this device delivers. It is noisy on either of the mic settings, and I would have to describe the sound quality as medium. Don\u0027t expect high fidelity. This is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else. Even analog tape would be better for most things. I may be fussier than most about this, having some professional background in audio, so the sound quality may be okay for most people. People have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything.\n\nFinally, playback was very disappointing to me. It has only the simplest playback features. It plays, pauses, fast forwards, and reverses, period. You cannot repeat either a single recording or portion of one, and you cannot create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play. It plays (manually) one recording at a time and that is it. You cannot set markers to fast forward or reverse to (like chapters on a DVD), and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain. In fact, this recorder is defined more by what it cannot do than what it can do. It is well built physically, although it is definitely designed for small hands, and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands aren\u0027t small.\n\nIf all you want is to record medium quality voice, this will work fine. Don\u0027t expect it to record music or anything like that - you will be disappointed. Think of it as the audio version of a $20 digital camera. Cheap, quick, grabs the image, but no frills at all. Don\u0027t expect much and you won\u0027t be disappointed. \n\nI am usually very happy with Olympus gear, but this is definitely below their usual standard. Unless your needs are very spartan and smple, I would recommend looking at more capable devices\n",

    "\n\nWhile spending hours trying to figure out how to set the alarm, I sometimes wonder what hater of humanity actual designed this thing\n",
    "\n1.  Buttons are too small, some of which are not spaced apart very well (very convenient for somebody waking up who can accidentally hit the wrong button).\n\n2.  Buttons are labeled, organized, and layed out confusingly.  For example, why not have an \"alarm interface\" which would include all of the alarm modes and features, and maybe a \"radio interface\" which would include all of the radio functions/settings.  You would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock.  But really, don\u0027t do it, make the smart choice.\n\n3.  Too many features/modes.  I understand some people prefer all of the different features, but I wanted a simple alarm clock with a buzzer/radio, and clock.  Of course all of these special modes are set as the default, so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode.  So for those who want a simple alarm clock, definitely DO NOT GET THIS!!\n\n4.  The button handling event is flawed.  For example, sometimes when I push a button, it does not handle the event (the device doesn\u0027t think that you pressed the button).  So I would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly.\n\n5.  It is very slow when holding the button down and waiting for the alarm clock to increment up and down.\n\n6.  Radio reception is very poor.  I have another radio right next to it that gets much better reception than this clock.\n\n7.  LED is not very bright and hard to read from 10 feet and farther out.\n\nI have nothing against TIMEX (they make great watches).

After trying this many times, the unit was \"still confused\", so I returned it for a replacement.\n\nMy second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me \"if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems.\" Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn\u0027t apply. Escort Radar also told me that \"excessive heat\" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100� heat, and I\u0027m sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90� or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn\u0027t design a ski that doesn\u0027t work below 35�, would you???\n\nThe most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money.\n",
    "\nI bought this one for its coaxial cable protection function, but the result is terrible. It greatly degrades the signal. When I use it with TV, the program on TV became unclear. When I use it with computer, the high-speed internet kept dropping. \n\nI intended to return it to Amazon, and I found Amazon\u0027s return policy is that only partial refund for opened products. How can I know it\u0027s dysfunctional before I destroyed the package and used it? In the future, I only buy stuff at online stores with local stores, such as bestbuy or circuit city, so that I can easily get refund.\n",
    "\nI bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my mp3 player through my radio. I like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station, but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit, which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations. I didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product, looking back, i should have. i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there aren\u0027t many stations that you can listen to on the radi\n",

I feel like I\u0027ve been ripped off, because they either didn\u0027t even look at it or they don\u0027t know how to test something for a problem.

For just over double the price of the Netgear I got a Windows CE PDA with GSM capability and full Skype compatibility. When browsing through your phone contacts your are given the choice to call through GSM or Skype. Because you have built-in Wi-Fi, you can make Skype calls and chats from any covered area, plus you can go on the internet using IE and check your e-mails with Outlook. I have also read that the Skype software that runs on dedicated phones like the Netgear and the Belkin is very crude due to the lack of processing power, whereas with a Windows CE-based device you have much faster processors that allow a Skype software closer to the one used on PCs.\nFor those of you alergic to Windows, just wait for the Skype for Symbian release and buy a Nokia or SonyEricsson smartphone.\nBottom line: Skype is too good an application to be wasted on poorly designed hardware\n",

However, I value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit I received last week.  It inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed.  So, if you\u0027re scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way, have you really accomplished anything?  No.  You must either try the whole thing again (with likely the same result), or you must figure out what page(s) is missing, scan it separately, and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page.  In the end, this machine made it +90% of the way to being a really great product, but the shortcoming fouls half the machine\u0027s overall utility.  Swing a little bit harder next time Fujitsu\n",

    "\nThe noise canceling is just barely discernible in comparison to when it is turned off and the music quality is not comparable to other earbuds in this price range ($60 list, $35 Amazon). The cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged, but I don\u0027t like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into (combined with the stronger cord, better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears)\n",
    "\nI had the same exact experience with the poor fit of these headphones and the rude customer service.  Their \u0027surround-sound\u0027 HE-592 phones don\u0027t fit well either.\n\nOn the phone Philips told me to buy a part at RadioShack to resolve my problem.  They couldn\u0027t give me an RS part number because \"it isn\u0027t their product\" but they recommend that over selling me or sending me  replacement ear pieces.  According to them this problem was all my fault, I should have realized it sooner, saved my receipts \u0026 packaging an returned them within 30 days.\n\nFrom a technology standpoint the electronics are outstanding for the size and price.  I like the performance of the phones on planes, trains, etc.  They really work well but I am amazed that Phillips would risk losing customers over pennies worth of silicone.  It is a shame Philips can\u0027t do better with the customer touchpoints like the ear piece design, their phone support and part replacement policies.\n\nTake a look at Shure\u0027s products.  Shure sells replacement foam and triple flange sleeve ear pieces for their products.  If you are in the same boat with me and like these except for the fit I think the triple flange sleeves may work as a replacement for the stock Phillips ear pieces\n",
    "\nIf you\u0027re not that picky about sound quality with music, then these may work for you.  I think the frequency response range with these earbuds are pretty minimal.  To me, the music is all mids.  It\u0027s missing significant highs and lows for this price range.\n\nI gave these away to a friend who\u0027s not that picky at all, but she could tell a difference in sound quality right away.  She normally uses the IPod earbuds which are uncomfortable to her.  However, the noise canceling out weighs the sound quality so she prefers to use these earbuds over her Ipod buds riding a crowded train or bus.\n\nHopefully I can find something affordable that has good frequency response.  Or maybe I need to educate myself.  Is it the frequency response, the impedence, or something else that covers the sound spectrum?  I\u0027m just looking for a good balance of lows, mids, and highs\n",
    "\n...So I was satisfied with the noise-cancelling qualities. The cloth cable is very nice and doesn\u0027t tangle as much as the usual plastic ones. I liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning. The headphones I purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and I found only one to be suitable for my ears. Of course, after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now I can\u0027t use these earphones until I find a replacement somewhere, which is proving to be troublesome. Super. I didn\u0027t buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now. In the meantime, I\u0027ve returned to some $10 non-earbud headphones and I really miss the noise-cancelling quality of these Philips earbuds. Life sucks and I want to die because now I can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation.\n",
    "\nI agree with the person who says there are no instructions and poor image quality.

I did discover though that I can use a stereo jack with R-L on one end and a mini jack on the ibook end to give me audio speakers on any TV or Stereo for my iTunes, and audio for a DVD that I am playing but I don\u0027t need to spend this much money to get that.

    "\nI have had this phone for about three years. I bought it primarily to use it as a good quality speaker-phone (with mute) for long conference calls. It was quite expensive (I paid $200 to get it) but here are what I have found to be its shortcomings: No caller-id display. This just baffles me. I get caller-Id on all other phones in the house except this one. I have tried every possible varient (resetted settings, disconnected other phones, etc.) but nothing works: I always get \"NO ID MESSAGE\" on the LCD. The second major shortcoming is that called-parties often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone. One way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly, but that sort-of defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone. Another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a corded-phone (hence will not work in case of emergencies). Finally, two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter. One good thing about the phone is that it looks quite good, has a professional appearance, and claims to have a duplex-speakerphone.\n",

And so far, I am not feeling good about buying it...\n\n1.\tThe sound quality is very poor.  Almost every song has some distortion and sounds \"muffled\" along with a good hiss.  I thought I was listening to a 70\u0027s era cassette it was so bad!  I have a high end Sony/Infinity system and the poor sound is very noticeable.  In desperation (and checking to make sure my amp was working fine) I plugged in my Apple dock from my 4th Gen Photo 60gb and the standard Apple AV cable.  The sound problem disappeared, and was crystal clear.\n2.\tThe menus to not work properly.  My Nano 5gb seems to work OK, but my 60gb 4th Gen Photo does not.  The menus are rather slow, and the artist, or album, or song titles disappear at random.  Sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data, but mostly it is just blank.  The cursor will scroll down as though there is data there, but nothing shows on the screen.  You can play the music from the blank screen, but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you cannot see any titles.  I like the idea, but VERY, VERY frustrating.\n3.\tThere is NO support at all from the DLO website. It just lets me download a PDF of the manual or to buy more accessories.  I did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems.   I am not impressed.  \n4.\tThere also all the other problems listed elsewhere, too light and build quality poor, annoying power LED on front, no artwork on TV menu etc...\n5.\tSo basically, it is WAY too expensive.  Not worth it.  Not even worth 10% of the price charged.\n\nI should have listened to all the comments above, and not believed some of the \"official\" reviews on the web.  So it is back in the box and ready for a trip back to the store.  I guess my lesson is that I should trust the reviews\n",

Now I start every morning with a \"boy I hate this thing.\"  Why? well here are few reasons why: You cannot read the numbers unless you are within 18\" and to get a backlight you must depress \"any button\"---not a bad idea but horribly executed.  The backlight lasts four seconds--way too fast in the night and \"any button\" is a lie because you can\u0027t press \"stop\" nor the \"on\" for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then, in the dark, have to figure out how to terminate.  The cd player spends more time \"reading\" your cd than it does playing it.  The \"tuner/band\" button is very sensitive and lord knows what you will wake up to, the screech of a not tuned in AM station happens way too often.  The worst of it all was I called Eton to tell them how much I hated it, just thought they might want to know. I had a friendly conversation with a very nice receptionist who assured me they wanted me to be happy and would do something, but first she wanted me to talk to the engineer/designer.

    "\nI bought this drive with the advice from my father who has bought several LaCie\u0027s for his company. He\u0027s always had good luck with them.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed when I opened the box was that there was a gap between the case and the faceplate. I called LaCie customer service and they sent me instructions on how to open the case and also noted my serial number so that I wouldn\u0027t void my warranty. The problem was that there were 2 screws that hold the faceplate onto the internal chassis who were not even tighted (as if they started the screws and didn\u0027t tighten them).\n\nBy the way... the actual HD inside the case is a Maxtor. If I had know that prior to purchase, I would not have bought the LaCie.\n\nI fixed the problem with the case and turned it on.. only to be hit with a high pitched winning sound coming from the HD. This noise will drive me crazy and is not \"Ultra Quiet\" as noted in the description. I\u0027m sending it back to Amazon for a refund\n",
    "\nWhat a disappointment that what I thought was a reputable company makes such an unreliable product.  After about a years time, my LaCie drive started clicking.  And then, no data.  It completely failed.  I too made the mistake of trusting this drive and didn\u0027t back it up.  I am sick about what I\u0027ve lost.  I\u0027ve emailed LaCie about the failure and have not received a reply.  Beware of LaCie external drives\n",

After reading other reviews on the gamepad, I figured I just got one that was poorly made and that the analog stick problem I had was just one of those several ones that was bad. Since it was only $20, I just left it alone. Well...after going months without a gamepad, I decided to get another Logitech gamepad, the same one I had, and guess what. After literally ONE DAY, the right analog stick stuck and is completely unresponsive. So, as far as I\u0027m concerned...they\u0027re all terrible controllers. PERIOD\n",

    "\nFrom day one, back in late August 2006, I\u0027ve had problems with this router--which I bought only because my ISP wouldn\u0027t install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord. Since I work from home, this wasn\u0027t an option at the time. I\u0027m not a tech guy, I don\u0027t care much for gadgets, but I\u0027m not stupid either, and I couldn\u0027t even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don\u0027t, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with \u0027mac cloning\u0027 or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. My ISP is coming Tuesday to install another outlet. No documentation. The install CD is configured for Windows and wouldn\u0027t work in Mac OS X. Online help sucks. The 800 support line sucks. This product sucks. Do not buy it\n",
    "\nI purchased this router (not from Amazon) about 6 months ago when my 5-year-old, very reliable, router died. I purchased it locally and someone came out and installed it.  I have had numerous problems with this router since then.  It does not stay connected and there is actually no option for \"always on.\"  After having some other problems, I took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware.  After that, it lost the setup information twice and the info had to be re-entered.  Then today, after being instructed to reset the router, it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade (there was no apparent way out of this).  So, I obtained the upgrade and according to the router message, it was updated successfully.  After that, I could not get the router to work at all.  I gave up and ordered an entirely different router (the same brand that I has used before with tremendous success).  My summary - save yourself time and aggravation and don\u0027t buy the Linksys WRT54G\n",

    "\nI originally purchased the unit during the winter because of a sale, but I didn\u0027t install it until the beginning of July for our cross country trip from Oregon to Wash. DC. During the trip, there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the Pacific Northwest. I kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city. Once I got out of the NW, I had no problems picking up a signal unless I was in a long tunnel or deep valley. \nI did notice the unit did get hot during the trip and I think that is why it is acting the way it is now (two months later). \n\nIt works fine when first turned on, but after 15 minutes, the signal flutuates and at times, no signal is received. The tech support said that I needed to check the wires, but since it is \u0027recently\u0027 installed and it doesn\u0027t happen when first turned on, I\u0027m ruling it a receiver problem.\n\nThe unit is placed just below the radio head and has been exposed to direct sunlight when parked.

    "\nA $10 cable does the same thing.  Do not believe the hype.  Monster is overpriced and people are starting to realize it.  Its digital, 1s and 0s.  Either it reads it or it doesnt.\n",
    "\nHave you ever heard the saying that something would cost you \"an arm and a leg\"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don\u0027t get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they\u0027re just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.\n\nSeveral people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there\u0027s really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you\u0027d see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.\n\nBut Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that\u0027s worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn\u0027t just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn\u0027t doubt if they\u0027re certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you\u0027re looking at the right cables.\n\nBut for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You\u0027ll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\n",

The adaptor for my Nano fit fine; and I didn\u0027t find the clock too bright (it has 3 settings).  But the sound is really terrible.  It sounds like its coming from a transistor radio.    \n\nAs well, it advertises that you will be able to go to sleep and wake up with your iPod.  But as we know, you don\u0027t need a clock radio to do that--your iPod will do that on its own if you set it.  \n\nI took this back after 5 days and hooked up some cheap computer speakers with a volume control.  They really sound better--I swear.  \n\n",

    "\nFrom cellphone and also the pager era I began my love affair with Motorola.  Don\u0027t need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it.  Sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great!  Don\u0027t Buy These!  They fall into the former category  \n\nI needed them quickly (to give my in-laws time to practice using them before we went on a cruise) so when I went to their house for the weekend I bought them from the hated \"Best Buy\".  I am returning all 4! (2 sets of 2 handsets).  Here was my experience:\n\nI went in and saw the Midland and the Cobra along side the Motorola.  Not knowing much of Midland, but recognizing Cobra from their history with low-end phones and electronics, I opted with the very stylish Motorola T6500R\u0027s.  I know.  Big Mistake!  I am a computer programmer and very intelligent, but when confronted with products I do not undestand, I go for the brand name.  Which is something that can be forgiven if, as now, you find out what the problem is and correct it.\n\nI took them home and recharged them.  First things first:  The feel in your hand.  EXCELLENT.  They feel as good as they look.  I purchased these to go on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera and to maintain contact both on the boat and in the ports: Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo san Lucas.  We wanted to make sure we did not \"lose\" my in-laws (really!  I mean it!  No, really ....) \n\nAnyway. Charged them up and turned them on. They come with a plastic-encased group of 3 AA rechargable batteries that fit nicely (and only one way--they are keyed) in the dual-purpose battery compartment.  This is nice: if you are out and running around and your charge goes down, simply buy 3 AA alkaline batteries and go on your way.  There is no problem if you forget you have the NORMAL NON-RECHARGABLE AA batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand.  Unlike other units, the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack, not the handset.  If you put it batteries, the charger makes no connection to the handset. If you put in the rechargable battery pack, 2 silver contacts from the battery pack  contact the charging stand and VOILA the unit charges.  Fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare, though!  It must be generic and able to fit several different Motorola products (production outsourced to Giant Int\u0027l Ltd--so if you thought this was a genuine Motorola built item, you are mistaken.  The entire Talkabout line are outsourced for production) as the dual-compartment charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the T6500R\u0027s.  I am a smart person though so I chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it.  Then I attempted to insert the T6500R\u0027s.  I say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction.  After you get it to EXACTLY the right position (look on the charger to watch for the LED to light up) the the hard part (of charging, that is) is over.\n\nNext item: Bad red LCD backed screen.  Hard to read in ANY light and impossible in the sunlight.  Settings were easy enough.  Channel, sub-channel, vibrate, NOAA broadcasts, etc.  However, the advertised QT (ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible Motorola handset) does not work unless you hit the PTT (push to talk) button (or the CALL button), wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking.  My in-laws are new to technology and are used to experiencing walkie-talkies when their kids were young.  Therefore this is unusual.  They automatically want to push the button and talk.  So, the first part of what they say is immediately lost. \n\nI say \"first part\".  I am assuming I actually caught a portion of what they said.  This brings me to the second major flaw.  This unit contains a HORRIBLE speaker.  If the volume is too low then you can\u0027t hear it.  Too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it.  We were really hard-pressed to find a happy medium.  AND, in a noisy room, it would\u0027ve been impossible to hear anything.\n\nSome merchants list these as 5 mile radios.  The packaging says 10.  The 1 watt GMRS suggests about 5-10.  We got less than 1.  Directly over a lake. In vehicles on the I-5, we drove less than 2 miles from their house  (which is DIRECTLY ON the interstate) and got no signal.  \n\nI got back to my house in San Jose (on top of Communications Hill...the largest \"hill\" in the area) and could not communicate to my spouse less than 1/2 mile away while he was coming up our road!\n\nSince the weekend, I have spent all my extra time on Amazon.com and Consumer Reports reviewing all the offerings.  (the latter, Consumer Reports\u0027 reviews are from July in 2002!) So, I think I am going to return these and purchase the Midland 5 watt GXT500\u0027s from Amazon.  Remember, doubling the wattage (in this case MORE than doubling) does not give double the signal.  As another others have stated, increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distance--ie: 2 watts to 4 watts does NOT double the distance the signal can reach.)\n\nHope this reveiw helps you\n",
    "\nI purchased a Biopod in March of 2006. Received brand new unit that included Omnipass software version 2.09. This software version released in 2004.\n\nContacted company that produced the software and they refused to upgrade to their latest version (v4) that had been released a month earlier unless they charged me the upgrade fee.\n\nThe version of software that comes with the Biopod (v2.09) pretty much only works with Internet Explorer and other Microsoft software. The new version (4) supposedly works with Firefox and several other non-Microsoft software programs. \n\nI recommend you avoid this product due to old software.

    "\nWhen realtime traffic monitoring came to my city, I immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife\u0027s daily business driving (2-500 miles weekly, crisscrossing a 50-mile area through major traffic routes). I quickly settled on an automotive GPS with realtime traffic monitoring. There are not yet many choices in this area, so the options boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720. (These use FM radio for the traffic info; the XM-radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since I don\u0027t want XM radio.)\n\nI chose the Cobra for its large screen and positive reviews in areas that were important to me. Its flawed routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be used in a well-known region. Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the primary needs.\n\nIn short, I don\u0027t know much about how the Cobra performs because I was only able to use it for a few short test trips. This is because the mounting hardware is one of the most deficient pieces of engineering I have ever encountered in higher-end electronics gear:\n\n- The only mounting option is via suction cup, which in tests would adhere reliably only to nearly flat glass. A stick-on disc for attaching the suction cup is also provided, but I did not attempt to use it and would not trust it to be able to hold this heavy (1.25 pound) unit over the long run. If your vehicle does not have a flat section of windshield in a convenient location, you will have very few options for mounting this unit.\n\n- California law prohibits attaching things to the windshield, meaning that California users either need to risk a minor ticket or find an acceptable alternate mounting point. (Good luck to you: I was unable to find one in three different vehicles!) Compounding the problem is that the mount has a very limited positioning range and easily runs out of adjustment room for most potential mounting alternatives.\n\n- Cobra does not offer any other mounts or mounting accessories at all - no beanbag or friction mount, no clamp, no fixed-base mount, nothing. If there is any aftermarket option (RAM Mount, etc.) I was unable to find it. You are stuck with Cobra\u0027s proprietary mount unless you are willing to modify the unit or its mounting pieces and fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base.\n\nI was *almost* willing to go the extra mile to make this unit work in my vehicle, even though the best solution would have been very awkward to dismount and remount, making it a potential theft target.\n\nThe final straw was when I found that the traffic receiver was faulty and I was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a timely manner (two days now and counting...) Enough\u0027s enough; something was telling me that this unit wasn\u0027t the right choice.\n\nSo this unit is being returned and I\u0027ve already ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement. The prices for the units through Amazon are nearly the same (especially when factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra comes with three months and gets $60 per year after that, while the Garmin comes with 15 months and has the same annual cost after that - so you have to add $60 to the Cobra to get a truly equivalent price). Garmin also has excellent mounts with a range of attachment options, some of the best map and routing tools, and a long track record with GPS units. It does have a smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface, but at least I can mount it properly and be able to tuck it away and remount it easily to prevent theft.\n\nThis unit gets two stars only because my brief experience with its function appears to live up to all the positive reviews - but overall, it\u0027s like a high-performance sports car with no wheels! I 100% recommend against it for California users and suggest that others try to lay hands on a sample unit to see if it can be properly mounted in your vehicle before laying out $750\n",

It took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the Rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for.  There is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player.\n\nIt\u0027s not ipod caliber quality, the only reason you\u0027d get it is for the Rhapsody service.  If you are not highly technical and patient, move on!\n\nPlayer itself works fine\n",
    "\nI ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?.  Easily enough, as it turns out.  \n\nI was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.\n\nDragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn\u0027t even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from \"My Computer\" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. \n\nI have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. \n\nThis was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. \n\nUsing Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.  \n\nAfter spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.\n\nThis is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it\u0027s hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.  \n\nThroughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands, it\u0027s without merit as a player.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "\nI had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk\u0027s other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn\u0027t give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped. \n\nIt would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. \"It\u0027s our way or the highway.\" Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.\n\nIt\u0027s too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won\u0027t make much difference if the device won\u0027t play.\n\n\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10\u0027s list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player).\n\nFinally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products!  As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one.  It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months.  Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though).\n\nBe smart, stick to a Creative, the new Toshiba Gigabeat S, or (clench your fists) an iPod\n",

    "\nI have had this TV for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out, I called Samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty.  They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours.  72 hours later still no call, I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours, still no call.  This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area.\n\nFianlly after 6 calls, Samsung referred me to another center.  I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later.  Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb (duh) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb. I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment.  Why they didn\u0027t order the bulb when they first set up the appointment, I don\u0027t know.  I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order.  Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support. My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry-go-round again. \n\nNow I realize that even though the set does (did) have a good picture etc, if you can\u0027t see it, it doesn\u0027t matter. I now have a very expensive paperweight. For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future.  What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months?  If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth.  I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point.  I agree, you solve the problem by doing the right thing the first time or the second time or third time etc I am hoping maybe the eighth time is the charm with my Samsung experience.\n",

It was sluggish across the screen and very insensitive, even after maxing out all the mouse settings in either direction.  \nLooking through the forums at Anycom informed me that many people had a similar problem and RMA\u0027s were being issued.  Considering that these problems arose earlier last year, I was upset that I was sold a defective product. I just send my mouse back to Newport, California for a replacement. \nThe features are solid, the size is acceptable but prone to cramping at first.  For a travel mouse it is exceptional, being rechargeable via USB.  Usuage with the USB cable attatched is OK but somewhat awkward as the cable comes from the \"head\" of the mouse, not the \"tail.\"\nWould I buy again? only if I didn\u0027t find another product that was rechargeable, bluetooth and optical.\n",
    "\nI bought this phone for a work-at-home situation.  I then discovered that the maximum number of characters I could enter into  a speed dial entry (the number itself, not the name) is 24 characters.  A telephone calling card number is 25 characters long, 26 if you program a pause (a space, for this phone) between the phone number and the card id/pin.  When I called Polycom about it, I was told that not everyone uses calling cards.  Funny.  I\u0027ve been issued a calling card at every company for which I\u0027ve worked (going back 25 years).  This is the only phone I\u0027ve ever owned (well, since the 80\u0027s) into which I could not program my calling cards.  Pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss.\n\nOn top of that, when I try and enter the calling card number and card id by hand, it never \"takes\" on the first try: the network doesn\u0027t recognize the card id and pin the first time I enter them.  I have to do it twice (I\u0027ve tried this a number of times, and it\u0027s consistent).\n\nFor that matter, the sound quality, especially through the headset (also purchased from polycom) is not that good.  Of course, that could be because the headset jack is \"loose.\"  You can easily move the jack from side to side, which makes the sound quality even worse. \n\nI regret having made this purchase.  I\u0027m going to scrap it and look for a new one from a different manufacturer.  The only reason I gave it one star is because the site interface here won\u0027t let me give it no stars\n",

    "\nI\u0027ve had this mouse for about a month...use it with my Mac G4 at home...and I\u0027m exhausted. It feels very nice in the hand and I really like the scrolling ball feature (hence the 2 stars), but it\u0027s just not predictable. Sometimes it glides along smoothly, most other times it tracks across the monitor like you\u0027re mousing over pebbles. I\u0027ve tried a number of different surfaces: desktop (light woodgrain); smooth, medium gray fabric mouse pad; mouse pad made specifically for optical mice (better than the other two) and I have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission--to no avail. It still lags and I have a hard time honing in on an object to select it (or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle...)\n\nI use Photoshop and other mousing intensive apps all day at work and at home and I need a mouse that is precise (for silhouetting, etc.). This just isn\u0027t it. You shouldn\u0027t have to think about mousing when you\u0027re doing it, it should just happen--immediately and smoothly, corded or cordless. And a \"newer\" technology should work better that a gummed up \"old\" tracking ball mouse!\n\nMaybe it doesn\u0027t like my older Mac. Maybe it\u0027s the bluetooth adapter. Whatever it is, it\u0027s not working...\n\nI\u0027ll be trying the Logitech MX1000 next. It has a recharging base and is Laser (instead of optical). I\u0027m hoping the higher price will translate into better performance\n",
    "\nFor my PowerBook - my first bluetooth mouse (a macally bt) worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk. So for the replacement I read the reviews and went with the Kensington bluetooth mini - primarily for the on/off functionality.\n\nI like the size and shape, the on/off switch and the scroll works just keen. However, tracking is a nightmare - especially when CPU usage is high (applications like Photoshop, Acrobat or using a VPN to access my work files). I tried troubleshooting, adjusting the track rate, but nope. The cursor continues to stutter across the screen with this mouse.\n\nI think I\u0027m going to throw in the towel and go back to wired\n",
    "\nOne of the reasons I chose this mouse, was because Apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling.  It turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others.  It jerks one line at a time ... the clicking is quite loud I might add.  Also, I have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if I don\u0027t.  Sometimes just clicking on System Preferences corrects the problem, but if I had it to do over, I\u0027d buy something else\n",
    "\nI bought this in April for my new Canon 30D and it worked great until several months ago. When I would go back to scroll through the recently taken pictures on my camera it would start saying \"Data Corrupted\".  It started out slowly then it would lose every third picture.  I tried to reformat the card and got an error message.  Now my camera does not recognize it nor does the camera software on my computer.  It was a wonderful card while it lasted but I too am hesitate to get another one.  Hopefully mine was a lemon too.....but then again\n",

I\u0027ve not been able to re-format the card in either a canon eos 5d, digital rebel, or using software on my computer. The card is now completely un-usable.\n\nAll of my older cards continue to work just fine.

One quark was the IP address field for the radius server wouldn\u0027t accept more than one character in the forms. Up and running. However, upon reboot, the WG302 loses it Radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again. SHOWSTOPPER. After logging this with Netgear support - their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support. While this would be fine if it was a config issue, it\u0027s not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase. They give no further support now.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend against the extra cost of this unit given it\u0027s buggy and has poor support. Config is difficult (I had to learn how to use the command line config), the upgrades are not well documented (they imply you have to import some obscure file with tftp - you don\u0027t but...), however the unit does have good range and works (No RADIUS of course) in a basic config.\n",
    "\nFirst - a disclaimer: I know very little about telephone headsets, but decided to buy one because I had a series of long telephone meetings coming up.\n\nI walked to my local Staples store, expecting to find a variety of prices and products - and thinking that I\u0027d pay perhaps $30 to $50 at the low end of the market.\n\nAt the store, I found that only the computer-based headsets were that cheap - and the only model that worked on a real, old-fashioned land line was the Plantronics S11 on display (it was priced at $130 Canadian).\n\nSince work was paying for it, I didn\u0027t mind spending the extra money, but expected that, at that price, the quality and ease of use would be quite high.\n\nWhen I brough it back to the office and installed it, I found that:\n\n- The regular handset and the headset cannot be plugged in at the same time. That means that every time I want to use the headset, I need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires.\n\n- The volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low - even when I turn up the volume controls to max. The people I spoke with complained enough that I switched back to my regular handset.\n\n- The microphone, although it\u0027s somewhat adjustable, is short and inflexible enough that I can\u0027t get it very close enough to my mouth. When I try to move it closer, the earpiece turns and slips off my ear.\n\n- The headset itself - that is, the plastic, adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker - is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head. It might have been better to design it like a regular two-sided earphone unit - so that it would be more balanced and stay secure.\n\nI don\u0027t know whether these comments apply only to the S11 or to most headsets for traditional phones in general.\n\nOverall, however, if I\u0027d been buying the S11 with my own money, I would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset\n",

    "\nMy very first cell phone was Motorola, and it served me great, so I became attached to the brand based on that experience ,and for that reason alone bought  Motorola SD4591 Digital Corded/Cordless System.  As we\u0027ve put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks. The battery life got very short very soon too. I was told I need to get different batteries NiH instead of NiCD. Naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too. As we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5.8Hz 2 line phone I decided to get Motorola MD7091 5.8GHz Digital 2-line Phone and remained loyal to Motorola. And boy was I wrong again. What others are saying about caller ID not showing as soon as I have another phone on the same line besides Motorola MD 7091 is true in my case too. I don\u0027t get it does Motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones??? This is really cheap trick\n\nNaturally, I could blame all this on poor quality of NiCD batteries, Wireless Network, Microwaves and phone company, and other brands\u0027 phones connected to my line. But what is the common thread through the entire ordeal: MOTOROLA. I will give other brands a try now, not yet sure which ones\n",

The hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections. \n\nAS usual, I was very careful: I always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product - I don\u0027t want to fail the installation for a very simple reason: the package doesn\u0027t come cheap... I am a software developer - I have half a dozen computers at home - and I did everything as instructed. I found the software to be very average in terms of usability (why do they try to do all these fancy effects??), but that\u0027s not very important when it works fine. \n\nUnfortunately, after just a couple of days, the keyboard stopped working. I finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer (both step were required - the on/off switch didn\u0027t work - same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective). Now, the mouse keeps on dropping connections. After a couple of hours of inactivity, the mouse simply stops responding.\n\nThis is simply unacceptable. Logitech knows that this product doesn\u0027t work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it wasn\u0027t tested properly.\n\nIt is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great. Don\u0027t buy this product, you could be very disappointed.\n\nNote that I have seen another installation done by professional Windows system administrators that had the exact same problems.\n\nNow don\u0027t get me wrong: the hardware is very nice.

At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you\u0027re in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package. The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own, but stay away from this Bluetooth combo. It is unstable and very frustrating to use\n",

    "\nI had Vonage since April, 2006.  I finally switched back to Qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone (my cell phone, as my Vonage line didn\u0027t work) with tech support.  Here is my experience:\n\n1) It took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone # over to Vonage.  Don\u0027t be too excited about getting the first month free- if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over.\n\n2) After my number was finally switched over, outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about 20-30 seconds.  Incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute.  This resulted in having to call the person back, saying \"sorry the call was dropped- we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems....\"\nThis is with the highest speed cable internet service available (8mbps download, 600kbps upload) and a wireless \u0027g\u0027 system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while I had Vonage problems.  I spent no less than 4 - 5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem.  After talking with tech support, sometimes the problem would be fixed temporarily- while I was on the phone with them- but return shortly thereafter.\n\n3) As a result of the problems I had, I asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working.  Be warned, they are very hard-nosed about providing any credits for poor or no service.  I spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service, and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given.  After the problem had been fixed (temporarily), I called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month, not previous months of no or poor service.  THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY ABOUT PROVIDING REFUNDS FOR POOR OR NO SERVICE.\n\n4) Finally, in September, still with dropped calls from Vonage, I switched back to Qwest to get reliable phone service.  I found customer service there has improved and is much better than Vonage.  And they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back.  \n\nIn the end, I am happy to pay the extra $10/month (after the first 3 months free) to get phone service that works.  I notice that $5 of the extra cost is for fees, etc. that the phone company has to charge but Vonage does not, which is unfortunate.  In any case, I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nOne last thing: Vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan, they never will.  This means eventually they will either go out of business, or have to raise rates.\n\nSave yourself the problems I had- pay the extra $ to get phone service that works\n",

They\u0027re so light that they don\u0027t have enough resistance to stay put.

The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn\u0027t go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower.\n\nI also couldn\u0027t get it to just make the ultrasonic sound. Even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise.

This was actually why I purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking.

    "\nThere are a lot of theoretically good ideas that  fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It\u0027s made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it\u0027s flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who \u0027seriously\u0027 uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There\u0027s a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine \u0027work\u0027 is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn\u0027t have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down (??) to do crunches is, we\u0027ve reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get\n",

    "\nBeing somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes \u0026 Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don\u0027t do so, for example you\u0027re sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light\n",

I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you\u0027ll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I\u0027ve found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.\n\nI\u0027ve come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you\u0027re looking to stay in this price range, you won\u0027t find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that\u0027s fine - the bread knife doesn\u0027t need to be strong like your chef\u0027s knife.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap\n\nCons:\n-Mashes your bread while it cuts\n-Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness\n-The \u0027spiky\u0027 serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread.\n\nSuggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade\n",

    "\nI ordered 3 (2x) sets of these so that I would have a full complement of 6 cookie sheets.\n\nWhen they arrived, I noted that they were a bit lighter than the commercial quality cookie sheets that I had used previously, but my thinking was that if they baked well, that was all that counted.  I always bake with an Exopat silicone mat on my sheets.\n\nUpon the first use, when they were placed in the oven, the edges of the cookie sheets turned up about a quarter of an inch - an ominous sign that the sheets are too thin.  The next thing I heard was the tap tap tap of sheets buckling in the oven.  Lack of dimensional stability at 350 degrees F translates to poor heat conduction, and burned cookie bottoms.  This symphony of metal buckling, courtesy of my new $15 cookie sheets.\n\nEven with the Exopat silicone sheets on them, the cookies were barely done when I decided to pull them from the oven to save the bottoms from getting burned - typical of cheap, thin cookie sheets that one knows one needs to \"double pan\" to prevent burning.  What a wonderful situation Amazon has presented me with - $90 and a garbage can full of cookie sheets.\n\nYes, into the garbage all six sheets went - no matter how costly, its even more so to live with poor quality baking implements and invent work-arounds to augment their performance.  These are no better than inexpensive supermarket cookie sheets - actually they\u0027re worse - with the price-point of supermarket wares, one can infer the quality that one is getting.\n\nI used to believe brands like Calphalon stood for quality, and this translated into some assurance that products bearing premium names would be of, at least, mezzanine quality.  When I buy on the web and cannot better scrutinize the items I\u0027m choosing, I tend to favor trusted brands.  As it turns out, these sheets did not have the Calphalon name on them anywhere - Calphalon apparently made the decision to buy up a bunch of cheap -Made in China- cookie sheets and sell them at a premium price by leveraging the Calphalon brand.\n\nWith the holiday baking season upon us, what do I plan to replace them with?  The Vollrath cookie sheets (not non-stick, but I use silicone mats, so do I care?) recommended in Cooks Illustrated magazine.  They\u0027re in stock at Chef Resource - their price everywhere is $19 but most vendors are out of them.  They\u0027re due to arrive via UPS day after tomorrow - Tuesday, 10/17.  Holiday baking is much too sacred a tradition to be left in the hands of Calphalon, apparently.\n\nIf I could give them no stars or provide an icon of 6 sheets going into the trash, I would so rate them.\n",

    "\nAt first I was pretty happy with the grater, but after a few days of use I started to notice that I was getting small shavings of metal as well as shredded cheese. I am no longer using it and would not recomend it to anyone\n",
    "\nWell, I\u0027m not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater.  Yes, it will grate cheese, but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1/4 of an inch.  This allows for the cheese to get \u0027gummed\u0027 up and eventually that large wad just falls through.  Also, for harder cheeses this means you\u0027re constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated.\n\nI\u0027ve yet to find a rotary grater I\u0027m happy with.  I\u0027ve broken several plastic models within 2 days of owning them.  While I\u0027ve yet to break this metal model, it just doesn\u0027t perfrom very well.

It is sturdy and reasonably well designed, but  the grating surfaces barely work at all, or at least mine didn\u0027t.  To get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle, so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese.  I tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh Parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on Jarlsberg.  Neither drum worked satisfactorily. That may be because it is made in China where hard western-style cheese is nearly unknown.  Yeah I  know it says MIU France but the box clearly says \"Made in China\".

    "\nTired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice, I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently.  No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice (\"rice cooker cup\")than it does for the water (\"regular measuring cup\"), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it\u0027s back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.\nYet another gripe is that it automatically goes into \"warm\" mode when it is finished. May be handy to have the warm option, but if you don\u0027t realize it\u0027s done and its left on \"warm\" for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab.\nIt seems very well made, and handsome Bau-Haus design, but unfotrtunately I can\u0027t use it because of the above problems. \n\nOthers\u0027 experience may vary.

I\u0027ve had mine for 10 years and now I\u0027m down to just two of the serving pieces.  They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it\u0027s gone.  If you\u0027re looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one.  They\u0027re definitely worth it because you\u0027ll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece.  I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don\u0027t use them anymore for anything but to mix items.  That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess.  I definitely recommend getting something else\n",
    "\nWe registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first AND second box we picked up. It\u0027s a very attractive set; too bad it can\u0027t actually contain food due to broken corners, can\u0027t be washed in a dishwasher, can\u0027t be used on the stove, and can\u0027t be used to broil! You can\u0027t use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee, which is why I wanted them. Additionally, Target doesn\u0027t allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise. I realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too, but I just thought I\u0027d point out that the Corningware doesn\u0027t have to be shipped to you to arrive broken\n",

    "\nI picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it.  The bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that I own.  I have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail.  It might be hard to see from the picture, but the \"holes\" for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser.  The slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas.  I imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product.  In my case they make me want to break it\n",
    "\nI had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely. The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter, even with daily cleaning. Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night, very noisily, until I put a timer on it to turn off at night. It was very diffult to clean, even with daily inspection.\n\nGo the old fashioned way, with a tray and a liner\n",

I got better litter and it started working better, but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use, the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it, but it just won\u0027t go in reverse. Overall, this was a big waste of time and money. I\u0027m not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It\u0027s too bad as it had a promising beginning.

    "\nI use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco.  You need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to, wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half.  Adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice.  It looks OK, but it just isn\u0027t the quality item you would expect with the name Cuisinart.  The price is also reasonable, so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that don\u0027t require as much water or cook time (like white rice)\n",
    "\nBought one recently from a Mervyns sale.  Rice burned especially at the bottom (black \u0026 crunchy).  So I returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective.  Nope, did the same thing.  So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn\u0027t burn as much this time.  For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker.  Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can\u0027t even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it.  Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup.  Hopefully they\u0027ll improve it.  Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker\n",

    "\nI have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother. She had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime. When I found the Kitchenaid cookie press on clearance for a mere $4.97 at my local Sears, I snatched it up with high hopes of recreating those fond childhood memories in the kitchen. \n\nIt\u0027s not a bad cookie press, but it\u0027s definitely not the best out there, I\u0027m sure...and it doesn\u0027t stack up at all to my mother\u0027s old-fashioned one. As stated in another review, many discs don\u0027t seem to work at all well with this press. I tried the tree, candy cane, and star discs and every single one just squirted out an uneven messy blob. Somehow the press pushed out the dough unevenly out of the press, so that one side of the shape was a blob while the other side was barely out of the press. \n\nThe rosette, swirl, and ribbon shapes did fairly well, though they turned out much larger shapes than the older model I\u0027m used to...hence extending the baking time of the cookies. I\u0027m used to nice, thin, crispy ribbons, but this press turned out very thick ones. \n\nI was also not very fond of the ratcheting style of the press. It felt as though I had less control over it than the squeeze-gun type.\n\nIf I\u0027d paid full price for this press, I would have been a bit upset at the quality, but having paid only $5 for it, I\u0027m just disappointed because I had thought Kitchenaid to be a better quality brand than what I\u0027ve seen in this cookie pres\n",

    "\nIn theory, this is a good machine.  It did, in fact, work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell.  All of the urine, drinks, vomit, whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet, starts to pool under the holding tank.  As it festers there, the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house.  This, to an extent, is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet, making more mess than you started with.  The first time this happened, Bissell customer service sent a replacement unit.  We started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it.  Bissell only wants to send us another (no doubt defective) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky, urine-leaking, mess-maker, don\u0027t buy this product !\n",

I bought it because I missed the ice in the door of my old fridge, but after trying it several times, I sent it back. It is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter. I dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it, so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it. I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup, and about 2 cups to fill a glass. You need 4 hands to operate it: 1 to hold the lid, 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place, and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place  (it slides out and then the ice lands on the base). Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice, you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass. I broke the glass the first time i tried it. It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear, making it even more wobbly. But as I said in the begging, it IS cute\n",
    "\nthe furniture itself is fine. or rather, it would be if it was shipped properly. before ordering anything from target, think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return. if you receive something damaged (and you will), be prepared for an extensive return process. chances are, the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well. this happened to me twice. if you\u0027re lucky, you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments. this, however, will take time. additionally, even if the piece is not cracked, you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood. i bought the desk, the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain. \n\nalso be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier. after waiting and waiting, and calling target on several occasions, someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications. \n\nquite honestly, this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth. by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax, this is not so much a \"deal\" but a waste of time and money.\n",
    "\nThis blender is frustrating. It offers good points, but in the end, the flaws outweigh the benefits. First the good:\n\nThe heavy glass base is stable and easy to clean. The powerful motor hacks through most foods with ease. When the blender is started, the motor begins at a low speed for a second or two before turning on fully.\n\nThe problems I found led me to toss the blender. If you plan on making blended soups, beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on. Without a heavy hand on the lid, both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling. Moderately thick, viscous liquids (a lemon cream was the latest such one I experienced) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar. This leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended, while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy. Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area.\n\nThe above problems were annoying, caused occasional swearing, but  were tolerable. What finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse. After several years of moderate use, the KitchenAid stopped working. The blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth. These reduce operating noise, but over time, weaken. The problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries. A burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container. The rubber drive teeth slipped, and friction quickly heated them up. The result was hot, floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades. When this happens, it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use. Before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped\n",

    "\nI purchased the Robinson Pyrex Candy Thermometer as a replacement for my old, cheap tube thermometer that was giving off readings.\nMy experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius.  It would get there and just freeze.  \n\nAdditionally, the design of the thermometer makes it difficult to read exactly where your temperature is.  This makes it unsuitable for most candy-making where the difference of a degree or so could be critical.  \n\nThe physical design of the thermometer feels very sturdy and is a nice stainless.  It is rather deceptive since you think you may be purchasing a higher quality tool than you are actually buying.  \n\nAll said and done, after you replace the sugar, flavorings, creams and other ingredients from your spoiled batches of candy...and pay for the gas to run these errands ...the cost of using Robinson\u0027s Pyrex Candy Thermometer goes way up.\n\nUse a cup of ice water.

    "\nThe only positive thing I can say about this candy thermometer is that the design allows it to stay on the sauce pan relatively well.

I was worried that the plastic storage was seeping toxins into my food when I washed it in the dishwasher. Also, I liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator--making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad.\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been happy with this product. The Pyrex lids must be pried off with a great deal of strength and diligence. This is not a task for a child, or even a standard adult. I have had to ask my husband on more than one occasion to take a lid off for me. I have even spilled food in attempts to take lids off.  \n\nAs an aside, I have also found that the Pyrex glass is heavy, which makes it less desirable to carry leftovers to work AND the containers do not \"nest,\" so they take up more space than they need to in the cabinet.\n\nI recommend Bormioli glass storage containers instead.

The oven was 400 and the dish was only in there for 25 minutes.  The kitchen was rather warm and the surface I set it on was not hot but definately not cool...so there was no drastic temperature change.  There were no scratches or cuts any where on the tray so I do not feel that the explosion was in anyway my fault. This explosion was purely the result of a poorly manufactured item\n",

This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM! \n",
    "\nI was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work, loved it. After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for \"spare parts\" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again\n",

    "\nI bought this because it was well priced, good sized and looked better than many other slow cookers. I assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that I gave away. The first time I used it (as soon as it got up to tempurature) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top. Then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter. The lid is the worst! At first I thought maybe I was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid. Now I realize this is the way it was designed! I made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid. The only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly,tumbly,bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter. Not to mention its probably a fire hazard. I don\u0027t think my paper towel idea is what Rival had in mind when they designed this! I wish I could return this but I threw away the receipt.    \n",

    "\nI ordered the My Cafe from Amazon in early October and received it a few days later. On initial set-up, the unit failed to prime.

I was given a return authorization number and told that I would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one. I have Fed Ex verification that the My Cafe was received by Bunn on October 18. I called Bunn on November 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes. No return call came. I called again on November 9th and was told that the My Cafe has been on back order and that I am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment. They could not, or would not, give me any meaningful information on when I might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original. My Cafe may be a great machine but Bunn\u0027s service is atrocious\n",

I\u0027m thinking for $200.00 this isn\u0027t right, and why hasn\u0027t the company fixed it? He was very nonchalant about it as if it didn\u0027t matter; just get a new one. This just isn\u0027t acceptable to me. There are many positive reviews so I\u0027m sure if you get a working one than you\u0027ll probably be happy with it. As for me, I refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company isn\u0027t even trying to remedy.

    "\nThe frother is great!  Easy to use etc.  The espresso temperature is 140 degrees F when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes.  At that LOW temperature you can\u0027t extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso.  Other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate.  This occurs when the grind is too fine.  I\u0027ve had this machine for over a year and it is NOT recommended. I use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine.  To add insult to injury, the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap.  I thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble.  Previously I had a Gaggia which is superior in every manner, and cheaper also.  The only reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the frother. \n",
    "\nI bought the Capresso 114 last December (the difference being, the model 112 has chrome trim and a very questionable milk reservoir). This machine is unbelievably finicky; you must use an extremely coarse grind (according to the manual), and almost zero tamping pressure (again, according to the manual), otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow (several minutes for a shot of espresso). Even when you get everything according to instructions (which includes, according to Capresso tech support, disassembling the machine every few days), it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso, which comes out weak, bitter, and with no crema. After two months of discussing this with Capresso tech support and getting nowhere, I returned the machine to Amazon. After that I bought a Krups XP 4000 -- bliss! The machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds, even with a fine grind and firm tamp.\n",
    "\nThis machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned European-style coffee drinker (coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean, not a tall cup of Sanka as the term is used in the US). Admittedly, I\u0027m really picky about my coffee, but $250 for this machine is ridiculous. I\u0027ve had coffee from a $40 Krups machine that is better than that made by the EspressoPro. I use high-quality pods with this machine (Molinari, Lucaffe, and Miscela d\u0027Oro) which guarantees consistency in other machines, but doesn\u0027t help with this machine. Here are my issues with the machine. \n\n1. The thermoblock isn\u0027t effective. I HAVE to put water in my espresso cup and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds before making an espresso or else my coffee will be lukewarm. Disgusting, even with high quality beans. Granted, unless your machine has a cup warmer, this is probably a good idea regardless of your machine, but with this machine, it is a REQUIREMENT, not an option, if you want hot coffee. \n\nSecond, steamed milk is lukewarm on a good day. The same heating problem occurs with steaming milk. I called Capresso, and they said to check all the fittings. In fact, after much frustration (I\u0027m not an idiot), I finally just sealed the connections with shrink tube, which leaves only two points where the connection could be weak. Still, I can\u0027t get HOT steam. What I do get is either lukewarm liquid milk, or cool, overly thick foam. In fact the foam is so unrefined and thick that it gives the impression that you could chew it. Nasty. \n\n2. The frothing mechanism is gimmicky and not effective. A standard \"frothing wand\" is much better. The mechanism on this machine is ineffective, lacks true control, and requires an extra step over a standard wand to clean. \n\nAs explained above, the heat is not sufficient, and the quality of foam is irregular and bad. I\u0027m embarrassed to serve coffee from this machine to guests, let alone drink it myself. I just can\u0027t get over the heat issue. Nothing kills a good coffee than lack of heat. This point is so important, if you take a gander at the Francis! Francis! X1 (and professional machines), there\u0027s a thermometer right on the front of the machine (and no, it\u0027s not purely an esthetic design issue since you can put several types of gauges/switches on an espresso machine--like a pressure gauge). The low heat generated results in really thick, solid foam. When I have guests, I just heat milk on the stovetop and use a handfrother instead of using the EspressoPro\u0027s lame mechanism. \n\nSecond, the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective. A little gate is regulated by the user through a twisting tab. It\u0027s just not good design. Since the milk actually passes through the machine and is heated internally by the machine, you can\u0027t really \"work\" the milk. A wand offers direct control and offers immediate visual response to whether you\u0027re getting foam or hot milk. \n\nYou know dried milk that collects on your steaming wand? Well, that\u0027s now inside your EspressoPro. With a traditional wand, you just wipe the wand with a wet rag. With this machine, you need to run hot water through the frothing mechanism (BEFORE you do this you need to wait for the block to heat up again). Plus, there\u0027s so many little pieces that need to be kept clean, it\u0027s a pain. What a bad design! \n\n3. 18 Bar? Yeah, right. This machine also doesn\u0027t generate enough pressure to develop nice crema. Granted, I use pods, but still, a certain amount of crema is expected. This machine produces a thin, insufficient amount of crema. The lack of sufficient pressure probably has to do with the poor thermoblock. \n\nI really can\u0027t recommend this machine. For $250, just go get a Krups or Braun. Better yet, spend $50 more and get an entry level Gaggia or Saeco. With this machine you\u0027re paying for looks and a gimmicky, ineffective frothing mechanism. This hunk o\u0027 junk is now buried deep in the back of my kitchen cabinet, as I truly would not feel right pawning this machine off on someone else. It is now appropriately \"retired\" from service, and I now enjoy perfect coffee every day from my Saeco Vienna Superautomatica. Now that\u0027s a machine, baby\n",
    "\nInside this unit there are 2 cleaning trays, one for the cleaning solution and the other for water to rinse.

I would not recommend this product to anyone. \n",

    "\nI too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit, and mind you, you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer.

    "\nAs another reviewer experienced, our Krups also leaks coffee all over the counter and subsequently the floor quite often, which is apparently related to having to have the carafe situated in just exactly the right place within a half a millimeter, and which place I have not yet discovered except occasionally by chance.  Carafe positioning appears to be the problem, because it doesn\u0027t leak every time.  Maybe my unit is defective, because other reviewers don\u0027t mention this, and believe me, you would notice this if it were occurring with yours. \n\nThe opening to pour in water is relatively small, but I don\u0027t have a huge problem with it. Be aware there is no automatic shut off.  It makes a fine cup of coffee for this non-coffee-gourmet, and I don\u0027t have a problem with spilling when I pour from the carafe into a cup.  But the leaking is forcing me to find another machine.  \n\nI wish I could find a reasonably-priced, non-leaking 12-cup machine with removable water reservoir, no-drip carafe, programmable, auto shut-off, easy-to-find replacement carafe and removable filter basket but alas, even on amazon.com, that machine does not appear to exist.  My sister has such a machine (Mr. Coffee URX23), but that model has been discontinued. \n",
    "\nI had slightly older edition of the Krups Crystal Aroma for several years, until I lost one carafe too many - if you\u0027re careless, when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop.  But that\u0027s my fault.  The Crystal Aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water, but overall, the quality of the coffee it produces is merely OK.  \nThe reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that Krups now makes a much better one.  \"Aroma control\" is a poor description for the recent line of Krups coffeemakers by that name actually do.  The Aroma Control machines have a simple, but ingenious mechanism for retaining the coffee in the brewing chamber for an extra minute before letting it drip through into the carafe.  More than filters or an exotic shape that supposedly retains aromas, that extra minute of brewing makes all the difference in the world.  Unless you\u0027re just in love with that round carafe, skip the \"Crystal Aroma\" and move on to the \"Aroma Control\" line. \n\n",

Your knives will never be the same if you attempt this. Companies sell sharpening tools to inexperienced knife sharpeners (like yourself) so they wreck their own knives and buy new. You buy clothes that require dry cleaning, correct?  bring your knives in and have them professionally sharpened and protect your investment. You should only buy one pair of knives in your lifetime and they can be handed down from generation to generation. \n\nA dull knife is a dangerous knife. A dull knife will require more pressure which will lead to a person cutting themselves. \n\nTake it from me. I was a CEO with a company who marketed these knives to people like you and we made alot of money too. These knives were never designed to be passed on from generation to generation\n",

The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter).  After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up.  I\u0027m waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I\u0027ll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray.

    "\ncThis is my second bread maker. I bought Cuisinart\u0027s one last year and had used it for about a year. I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point.\n\nCuisinart\u0027s one has obviously some problems:\n 1. Bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard.\n 2. It is very noisy during kneading cycle as I can not hear the music from the audio.\n 3. Paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts.\n 4. Some basic cycle have no \"Pre-heat\" cycle. It means I need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely. But it is very hard and sometimes I fail.\n 5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula.\n\nOne of my friends owns Panasonic bread maker and showed it to me. I was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different. She has never had such a problem which I have had. Then I decided to get Panasonic one although my first one is still working. The bread maker was delivered in 2 days. I tried same recipe which I often used for Cuisinart\u0027s. The bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from Cuisinart. Bread is nicely blown, crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside. It is just perfect. I guess these difference come from mainly these things:\n 1. The case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful.\n 2. \"Pre heat\" cycle adjust the temperature of water well. I do not have to make appropriate temperature\u0027s water any more.\n 3. This machine has the special room for yeast. It works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer.\n\nI think I never back to Cuisinart although I miss some points (Sophisticated design or the window on the rid which I can see inside of the case through) of Cuisinart a little bit. I highly recommend this bread maker.  \n\n",

I was able to bent it backwards easily, yet that \"perfect\" posture didn\u0027t hold for long, it\u0027s back to its bad sagging position again very soon.\n\nThen it got way worse, when I try to cool cakes on it. Cookies aren\u0027t that bad, since they are light. When I have the moist and right out of the oven cake sitting on that rack, the middle of the rack is barely touching my kitchen counter top already.

    "\nThis is a gorgeous ice bucket. It is large and stylish.  However, I cannot recommend it because of the lid.  The lid is attached to the bucket and does not come completely off.  Instead, it pivots and swings up.  The problem with this is that you cannot fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing.  And, because the lid is not removable, it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne/wine cooler.  Poor design flaw.  I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I don\u0027t need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way. You\u0027ll notice in OXO\u0027s main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up.  Why?  Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way.  Hey OXO, that\u0027s the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar! \n\nWould it have killed OXO to put a knob/handle on the lid and let the customer decide if they want the lid on or off? I swear sometimes I think manufacturers never bother actually testing out the things they design. If they had, surely they would have noticed how bad their lid idea was.  Or they could have looked at every other ice bucket on the market to see that theirs is the only one in which the lid doesn\u0027t come off.  That should have been a clue to them that there are obvious merits to having  a removable lid.\n\nThis bucket has a clear plastic lid.  I don\u0027t understand why it\u0027s plastic at all.  First of all, it\u0027s an ice bucket!  I think everyone knows ice is inside without needing to peek through the lid.  Secondly, a metal lid will keep the temperature inside colder longer than than a plastic lid. That is why the bucket is made of metal, not plastic.  Metal is a better conductor of heat and cold. \n \nI wish I had noticed the lid before I purchased it.  I didn\u0027t pay close enough attention. I suppose I assumed it was a normal lid that came off like all the others.  Thankfully I got the bucket from my local Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond making its return very easy.  I am sorry I have to return it  because this really is a nice looking bucket. However, I don\u0027t intend to spend $40 on an ice bucket just to sit there, look pretty and receive compliments--that\u0027s my job as hostess :-).  I want an ice bucket that is functional too.  \n\nOh, well...my search for the perfect ice bucket continues.\n",

    "\nMy first and only use was to cook a roast in the oven at 275 degrees and within the first 30 minutes it started to give me the wrong readings.  I have had it a while but have not used it as it is only good for the oven. The statement on the inside instructions \"WHEN COOKING IN A BARBECUE OR SMOKER, DO NOT USE AS A CONTINUOUS READ THERMOMETER, USE ONLY AS AN INSTANT READ THERMOMETER.\", \"5. DO NOT USE THIS UNIT TO MEASURE COOKING TEMPERATURES OVER 392\u0026#9702;F.\" as well as \"WARRANTY EXCLUDES THERMOMETER PROBES.\" should be on the outside, letting people know this is only for the oven for continuous use and that the probes are junk.  If you have to keep checking the meat in a smoker over many hours, a cheap $6.00 meat thermometer will work just fine other than letting out the heat.  Why does the outside packaging say the reading range is 86\u0026#9702; to 572\u0026#9702; if you can only use to 392\u0026#9702;.  I would say this is only a typo and they likely did a cut and paste on their lower temperature unit\u0027s instructions, but 275\u0026#9702; in the oven killed mine so maybe not?  Cut to the chase, look for a better unit and let me know when you find it\n",

    "\nThis unit looks like it would be fun for the kids, but in fact, it barely works. Even when the insert is pre-frozen in a zero degree freezer, the maching has problems getting the mix even into a \"soft\" state, and even when it gets close to that, the ice cream does not dispense in a manner that allows for the classic soft-serve look in the cone. An email to cuisinart regarding the problem went unanswered. We used it twice, and gave up. One hint that\u0027s not in the instructions: you have to keep the machine running while dispensing -- or trying to dispense -- the ice cream. Another hint that\u0027s not in the instructions: don\u0027t buy this item\n",

We attempted to correct the problem with Cuisinart via e-mail and phone calls and the issue still is not resolved and therefore we are returning the ice cream maker.\n\nNegative points aside, the ice cream maker did make great ice cream. (Thanks mostly to the Ben and Jerry\u0027s recipe book we ordered at the same time.)  We\u0027ll look into getting a better quality ice cream  maker in the near future.

Only the 8\" chef\u0027s knife and the shears have any feel of quality at all, the rest are -very- thin and flimsy.  \u0027Laser-cut\u0027 edges are overrated - make them another millimeter thick please, so they can make a precise cut without the blade bending and taking off in an unintended direction.

    "\nI myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot, I will agree with other reviewers, this Delonghi is Dewrongi. My husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre-heat the carafe before brewing. If he doesn\u0027t get a chance to drink it right away, he puts the carafe (filled with coffee) onto the stovetop on low.  Well a couple mornings ago, we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work. Without thinking, he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat. Next thing I know I\u0027m screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading. He dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah, no damage was done. (We are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months.\nSo after reading the other reviews, I\u0027m no longer pursuing a replacement carafe but instead will buy him a whole new machine...and it won\u0027t be a Delonghi\n",

I bought mine from Costco, and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs.  I hope that is not the problem, but that is all I can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews.  So...who else bought this unit from Costco?

I wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if I mailed it in, but with the weight of the set (because it really is a heavy-duty set of flatware) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all I would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time.

A few years ago, we received a  Krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it! However, this particular toaster rarely worked. In fact, I would say that 85% time it would either not toast or would \"flip\" the toast prematurely e.g. 5 second or less. I have no idea if this is a  fluck in quality control or not, but I highly recommend buying a  different toaster. I know, I thought, Krups makes a toaster?

    "\nI have had this gadget for a little over a year as we got it as a wedding gift.  I had not used it as it did not seem worth the trouble to plan on getting it out ahead of time and charging it for 15 hours when I could use a manual grater right when I needed it.  Last week, I needed to shred some cheddar for a recipe.  I read the instructions front to back, allowed it to charge the full amount of time, and I was pretty excited when it came time to try it out.  Right from the start, I knew it was junk.  You are supposed to be able to lift the piece of plastic up and have it stay in the up position while you change the blade.  Not mine.  The plastic piece kept coming off, and dozens of tries to keep it upright resulted in dozens of failures.  I decided to look past that and judge purely on the shredding ability.  Once I started trying to grate, I had a really hard time getting the thing to shred.  I tried varying degrees of pressure.  As others commented, the cheese does get stuck EVERYWHERE.  Then, the cheese that does come out is in tiny little shreds.  I did not get the nice big shreds that I am used to with my manual grater.  My husband thought I was doing it wrong, so he tried it.  He had the same result.  I will not even sell this at a rummage sale or give it to goodwill, because people are better off without it.  Since it was a gift, I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not out any money.  It is going in the trash\n",

    "\nI received this as a gift for Christmas. It worked like a charm for ice cream and lemon slush 3 times. BUT then, the base burst in my freezer, spewing foul scented goo all over.

Now I have to buy another one, and it won\u0027t be this brand\n",
    "\nI bought this item on sale at Shopko, where it will be returned today.  I froze the gel disk as instructed, bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream, cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed.  After 45 minutes of mixing I ended up with ice cream soup. You could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat.  I put it in a container in the freezer.  The next morning I had an ice cream brick.  Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop.  This stuff gets harder than cement!  After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic-like aftertaste.  I had to throw it all out.  \n\nIf this isn\u0027t enough to deter you keep in mind that the \"heavy cream\" called for in most of the recipes listed in the booklet costs a pretty hefty price.  I paid $2.50 for the heavy cream listed to make 1.5 quarts of ice cream.  That price doesn\u0027t even include the other ingredients listed.  \n\nBuyer Beware\n",
    "\nI used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust. The surface is fragile and hard to clean. I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What\u0027s the point if you can\u0027t clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. \n\nJust to clarify--the mat was used to line an airbake cookie sheet for the pizza and to line a baking pan with the roast atop of a bed of carrots and celery. I like my pizza crisp yet moist so I reheat it in a skillet when I can. I bake thin or drier pizza on an insulated sheet to keep it from getting desiccated. When I make a roast--I don\u0027t need any gravy. I slow roast the Alton Brown way and the juice stays in the meat rather than ending up in the bottom of the pan. The meat literally makes its own au jus in your mouth. I put a bed of vegetables on the bottom to further reduce the heat transfer from the pan to the meat.  Not cooking for a crowd?  Try a 3 inch thick steak (stood on end) cooked this way. You won\u0027t want to share. I don\u0027t slow roast turkey but it only takes 2-1/2 hours to do a 14-16 pound bird if you temper it properly. My sister always gets comments on how moist and juicy it is. \n\nIn fairness, when I gave my neice two of my unused large pastry/baking mats, she used them successfully to make her chocolate dipped strawberries, turtles, etc.\n",
    "\nWell reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that\u0027s the job of a kettle, I admit.

As you tilt the kettle to pour, you\u0027re also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers.

    "\nI needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch.  I had read other reviews of the Bissell Little Green Machine that were unfavourable, so headed off to the store to find something else . . . . the Atlantis Express looked interesting, and I hadn\u0027t seen it before.\n\nSuffice to say, it did get the cat stains out of the couch, but not after revealing itself as a really poorly designed product.\n\n- The machine is LOUD, very loud\n- The cleaning \u0027head\u0027 on the end of the hose has a \u0027flip-up\u0027 cover to make it easier to clean where it sucks in lint and stuff into the machine.  That is a great idea, but there is no gasket to make the joints true and tight . . .. so while it may have 2 times the power of other machines based on sheer power of the motor, it looses some of this power when you actually use it to try and suck water and cleaning solution back up.\n- The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine.  However to accomplish this, the cleaning head has 2 seperate spayers on the underside.  Neither are centered, the one on the left operates when you have the slider set to solution and the one to the right operates when you have slider set to rinse.  As they are not centered, they overspray quite a bit past the edge of the cleaning tool. Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 inches past the edge of the cleaning head.  To top it off, when you release the trigger, the cleaning head continues to drip water for a few moments, meaning that you have to go VERY slowly or risk dripping everywhere.\n\nWhile it functioned well enough to clean my couch, it was a brutal and terrible experience.  When I bought it I figured it could be used too on my car interior . . . . but the frustration of cleaning a small patch on my couch quickly quelled that thougt.\n\nI returned the Atlantis Express to the store and went out and bought a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. -- which I should have done right from the start--- the hoover runs circles around this machine\n",
    "\nThe first, and only time, I tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster. While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture, the delivery men stained the new carpet. I whipped out our new Atlantis, filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge. With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer. Don\u0027t waste your money with this thing. There has to be a better answer\n",
    "\nWish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this. I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another. (want to bet it won\u0027t be a Braun?) Additionally, what do we do for coffee in the mean time?  Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve had two of these now, and they both had one serious flaw: the trumpeted \"brew and pause\" feature DOES NOT WORK.  Pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it weren\u0027t such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up.\nAlso, it\u0027s hard not to spill some water on the heating plate, either during filling or brewing, creating a consequent sizzling sound that adds a lot of ambience -- if you live in a steak house.\nConsidering how many other coffee makers are available out there, these flaws make this machine a mistake.\nToo bad, because some things are done quite nicely: the controls are good and easy to set, and the overall styling is sleek, euro-cool, and compact.  Unless you live in a community where calcified sewage runs through the taps, the water filters do about as much as a rain dance.\nPass on this one\n",

I moved the crock to the side to see if I had not properly plugged it in since the light was out. I brushed my hand against the exterior lip and received a first degree burn. Farberwear company customer service said \"the light is a little dim\" but you should be able to see it. Yes, you can see it if you look up from below the crockpot you will see a faint glow. The crock pot sits very loosely in its container leaving a large gap between the food container and the heater housing.Heat escapes through these gaps which accounts for the overheated exterior. I would advise those with kids, especially, to find another slow cooker\n",
    "\nI received my Taylor Professional [and] it appeared to be behaving normally except it shut itself off after 4 to 7 minutes even while its readings were changing. Now, it is supposed to save its battery life by shutting off if there is no change in its temperature reading for 10 minutes, but it should stay on if its readings are changing. The temperatures were no where near the extremes of the thermometer\u0027s range, so this wasn\u0027t a case of shutting down because of that. ... I e-mailed the manufacturer about the problem and was told I could return it to them for replacement. I did this and less than three weeks later received a new one from them. Surprise, surprise -- this one behaved the same way, shutting off after 4 or 5 minutes even while its readings were changing. I e-mailed Taylor again about this and suggested they check out their existing supply of this model, as I suspected they had many that were shutting down like this. ...

One reviewer said to LIBERALLY grease these pans, but I don\u0027t understand why there\u0027s so much work for greasing a \"non-stick\" pan.  I had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no \"non-stick\"\n",
    "\nI purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it\u0027s too cold to be outside.  It looks very nice and clean up is super easy.  The problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it.\nThe first time I used it, I grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan, I had no problem with smoke.\nThis is great, I thought.   The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either)  I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more.  It was not a pleasant experience.  Right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until I decide to give it one more try.  If it fairs better next time I will return and give it a better review..maybe\n",

    "\nWe had registered for All-Clad pans for our wedding last year, and decided to go with a Calphalon commercial nonstick set instead.  The person helping us highly recommended the Calphalon One infused anodized set instead, and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic.  We bought that set and have had it for nearly a year.  We hardly ever use it, however, because things stick so badly, even with oil.  While the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and Bar Keeper\u0027s Friend, I\u0027m very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it\n",
    "\nAt first we loved this pan.  We\u0027ve used it quite a bit, but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated. I can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven.  I\u0027ve contacted All Clad and am waiting to see what they say. Needless to say, I would have been much happier with a less expensive pan.  I am very happy with all the other All Clad pans that we have, but this one is a disappointment\n",
    "\nThis item is the black sheep of the All Clad line. It is NOT a triply pan like other All Clad products and is made entirely of stainless steel(no aluminum). It is also made in Korea where other All Clad products are made in the USA. \n\nThere are better roasters out there for less than half the price of this roaster\n",
    "\nI liked the look of these pots. I bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta, potatoes etc. The stainless steel used is very poor quality.\n\nAfter just over a month all of them have rust spots on the bottoms and where the handles meet the pot. After the first use I noticed small discolored spots on the inside bottoms, not your typical discoloration from heat, and they would not polish out with bar keepers friend. These spots are now where I see rust forming after each use. These are definitly no where near the quality of my all-clad and calphalon stainless steel cookware, but then again neither is the price.\n\nAll said I wouldn\u0027t buy them again. Even cheap stainless steel pots and pans shouldn\u0027t rust with normal use. Even the free Cuisinart Santoku Knife I received is rusting and I\u0027ve only used it 3 times. I cannot stress how bad the steel is!\n\nAs far as cooking goes, they work great. The aluminum core bottoms conduct the heat well. They also have a great look aside from the rusting\n",
    "\nI bought this coffee maker, because some people gave it high recommendation here. I think I wasted my money.\nIt worked only for a couple of days. Finally, it just stopped working and I had to push the button at least three times in order to collect a small cup of coffee. That is ridiculous for an expensive coffee maker priced at $80 above. It makes me feel that this Japanese coffee maker is like Sony-made products, having a fancy looking but lousy quality.\nSave your money for some other coffe makers, and avoid this one\n",
    "\nI have to agree with the other negative reviews. This insert loosely fits the All-Clad 3-Quart Casserole Pan I bought with it (which I could understand if I were trying to use it with another brand). It being from the same line and company one would think that someone would have tested how well it worked. As with all All-Clad products it\u0027s built very well but who cares about that if it doesn\u0027t work properly. Someone else mentioned all the perforations are in the bottom of the insert, it would be better if there were holes in the sides as well. I think my artichokes would cook a little faster if tons of steam wasn\u0027t rolling out from in between the insert and pan. It works, just not very well.\n\n",
    "\nWe\u0027re a small restaurant (16 seats), serving dinner 4 nights a week, and we use the blender for soups, Caesar dressing, etc., once or twice a week, but never use ice in it or anything like that. We\u0027ve had two of this same model now, and had the same problem with both of them. The black collar, the part of the base where you set the container, is plastic, and on both blenders has broken. The first time it lasted almost a year, and we figured that wasn\u0027t too bad -- especially when you compare the cost to a true commercial/professional blender, which are $300+. Also, we really like the blender in terms of function, so we picked up another one. This time, the exact same thing happene, except that the collar cracked within 2 weeks!! \n\nMy other complaint is that I found Waring Customer Service to be disinterested \u0026 unhelpful -- especially because I contacted them about buying a new model, not about problems with the one we had. I saw a model on their website but no purchasing info was listed; I emailed to find out where to purchase, and the rep seemed almost inconvenienced by my inquiry\n",

    "\nUnfortunately, I\u0027ve ordered more than my share of FoodSaver products, having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage,  despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers.\n\nWhat many of them claim is very much to the point: plastic containers frequently develop cracks and loss of vacuum.  I\u0027ve had many of their marinators and storage canisters prove defective after less than 10 uses.  It seems to be related to the material properties and container size characteristics.  The smaller containers seem to last longer. Those with thick walls relative to the specified volume or reinforcing structures seem to last just a bit longer.\n\nIn plain language, the plastic containers are unreliable.  FoodSaver should develop materials and designs that can handle the stress of the vacuum cycling placed on them, or quit the the business.  Since their products have been on the market for many years, I can only assume they are more interested in recruiting new customers than satisfying existing customers. If you like filling out warranty forms every few weeks, more power to you.\n\nBottle sealers are equally worthless.  Every one that I bought lost vacuum in short order.  In one case, a defective seal resulted in a spill of cooking oil that damaged a nylon tent and other camping gear.\n\nFoodSaver has done a good job with certain items in their product line.  The vacuum unit is well designed and performs reliably, as long as the instuctions are followed.  The bagging system is unassailable, even though the cost of the bags and rolls is quite high (read Consumer Reports reviews).  And, to be fair, their Universal lids are excellent.  Use them to seal  small glass jars or stainless steel bowls, and there is no loss of vacuum due to cracked plastic.\n\nBottom line?  Be careful which products you buy.  Some are excellent, while others are pure junk.\n\n",

I called the company and they were very nice about it. They quickly sent me a replacement part. I thought, what a great company. Then when it would not work one morning just a little over two years after I bought it I called them again. They explained that it was no longer under warranty (I think I missed the warranty term by a month or two.) They offered that I could purchase a refurbished one from them for about half the price of the original (I paid about $70.00, a refurbished one was, I think, $35.00) but it came with no warranty and I\u0027d have to pay shipping. I was very, very disappointed. Thankfully, I had my old drip coffee maker in the attic. I pulled that out and have been using it although it does not make as good a cup of coffee as this percolator did. \nThis product should have lasted me years. I am looking for another good cordless percolator but would not consider another product by this company. I gave it the two star rating instead of one because it did truly make a good cup of coffee but the two year life is just not worth the cost\n",

The box told me to set the temperature to 375 degress. Guess what, there is no 375 degree temperature on this unit. There is a 355 and 390. Other frequently requested temperature settings missing on this unit are 350, 400, 450. 425 is the only relatively common temperature setting that is found on this Toaster Oven. \nAs a \"don\u0027t fire up the big oven heating up the house on a hot summer day\" unit, this toaster oven comes up a little short\n",

But my first attempt to use it was a failure--the small steamer holes (and not very many of them) are easily covered by the food to be steamed, leaving the insert to function like a double boiler.  After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash (which should take 20 minutes at most), I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it.  I\u0027m sure that some foods will steam in this pan, but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem\n",

Sure there is technique to learn, but I spent a good long time on several different items. It heats up quick and produces steam well etc, but it performed far below what I thought were reasonable expectations. It also has a low hanger so you constantly have to extend the hose to let the condensation run back down or else get gurgling and low output. I returned it, amazon was good about that, and the return shipping was less than what amazon charged me in the first place\n",

AHH..  Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color!  The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.  I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems!  Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected\n",

This thing burns my toast every time, unless I watch it carefully and take it out at precisely the right time.  Part of the problem seems to be that the timer doesn\u0027t work very well in small increments, and in some cases never turns itself off.

Two weeks after that it sparked and puffed and has not turned on since.\nI live in Hawaii and it is currently in the rainy season.

You still have to\nbend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumps\ninto the pull out tray. And that\u0027s the clumps that aren\u0027t stuck in the\nlitter filter piece, which gets easily clogged and is not really\nsomething I want to deal with cleaning. Besides not all clumps going\ninto the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.\nAlso, I bought the \u0027regular\u0027 size one and the filter piece goes almost\nright in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was very\nsmall.

    "\nI thought the four 4.5 inch springform pans would be equivalent to one 9.0 inch springform pan.  After all, the areas are equal, i.e. 4 * 2.25 * 2.25 * pi \u003d\u003d 4.5 * 4.5 * pi.  I thought I could use the recipe for a 9-inch cheesecake and have 4 4.5-inch cheesecakes that tasted the same but were a more convenient size for giving as gifts.  \n\nHowever, while the areas are the same, the volumes are not.  The pans are not deep enough.  While a 9-inch springform pan is 3 inches deep, these 4.5-inch springform pans are 1.5 inches deep.  Therefore, if you use the recipe for a 9 inch cheese cake, you have a lot of batter left over.  If you half the recipe, you produce baked goods that taste something like cheesecake but not as dense or as moist or as rich.\n\nI was very disappointed in these pans.  They may be good for something, but I don\u0027t know what.  They are well-made, so I won\u0027t throw them away, but right now I feel like they were a waste of money\n",

    "\nI bought this back in 1999, and I love the way it cooks chicken and salmon steaks, but it\u0027s not built to last.  First, after about 3 years, the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight, and then the 5th year, the knob broke off, so I have to use pliers to turn it on.  It still cooks chicken great, but after trying to superglue the \"feet\" back on and the knob, they broke again right away.  \n\nCleaning is a pain, and the non-stick stuff got scraped right off. The food tray that goes on top is hard to clean too.\n\n Don\u0027t try to cook burgers in the basket, because they shrink as the fat drips out, no matter how tight you make the basket, and they start sliding around and falling apart as they hit each other. \n\nCooking times were always longer than the cookbook says.  \n\nI used the skewers once to cook some ribs, and they\u0027re so flimsy, that they kept falling off the spit from the weight of the ribs.\n\nI still use it, but I wouldn\u0027t buy a 2nd one after reading all the reviews.

    "\nI bought this to simplify making fries, it was a disappointment. It takes a lot of effort to push through a potato, and when it does go through it most likely won\u0027t go straight. Either save your money and use a knife, or spend more and get a mandoline\n",
    "\nI found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill:\n\n1.) Once you get a successful potatoe to cut through, the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids.  Getting them out is a real pain, you need a lot of careful tugging and wiggling to remove them without breaking them.  Just a mess.\n\n2.) If you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe, you are in a very dangerous zone.  Think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction.\n\n3.) Maybe my set was off tolerance, but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself.  I had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously.  Not a big deal, but that for me sealed the 1-star rating.\n\nI guess the bottom line is, if you expect nothing out of it, you might use it, or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes.  For me, I\u0027ve decided to get one of those Vollcraft units.  It\u0027s on order\n",
    "\nAfter cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan, I\u0027m sad to say that my non-stick pan sticks.  We\u0027ve had this pan for maybe 8 months and I just assumed that pans lasted for several years.  We even bought this pan plus the 8\" for my mother-in-law for Christmas.  What a disappointment.  Better begin research on a new pan...and I\u0027ll make sure to read the reviews.   \n",
    "\nWhen I first bought this pan I was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from Costco.  That pan lasted about 3 years and I got my money\u0027s worth.\n\nThe positive review from America\u0027s Test Kitchen is what pointed me in this direction.  The Farberware pan was a joy to use when I first bought it and I loved the even heat.  All of the positive comments are accurate at first.\n\nThe problem is it only lasted 3 months before it lost it\u0027s nonstick properties almost completely.  I never used spray on oil or subjected it to high heat.  I was always very meticilous about the way I cleaned it and never touched the surface with anything but plastic.  I even bought a special soft plastic cleaning brush so as to be very delicate with the surface.\n\nI have been using nonstick skillets since they first came out many years ago.  With the exception of one ultra cheapo model I have NEVER had a nonstick that had its nonstick go bad so quickly.  Of course I can send this back to Farberware but it seems clear that if it has lost it\u0027s nonstick properties they only have to say it was my fault.  Why waste $10 in shipping costs?  This is my last Farberware product.\n\nAfter writing this first part of the review I thought it would only be fair to email Farberware to let them respond.  After doing some googling I have found that there is no email.  It is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone.  They sold their warranty service to a different company, All American Lighting in Berwick, PA.  As it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service.  If this isn\u0027t really Farberware what exactly is their incentive to provide good service?  You can check on consumeraffairs dot com and other places and you\u0027ll get an eyeful.

Imagine, a frying pan that doesn\u0027t like heat.  How much heat?  They don\u0027t tell you.  If your pan is sticking, then it must have been toooo much.  Buy at your own risk\n",

I really loved it at first...perfectly roasted chickens,loin roasts, and turkeys.  Oddly enough, the thermometer works great but the probe itself isn\u0027t designed to handle much time in the oven.  If you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven ,the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable.  Even at lower temperatures, the heat finally takes its\u0027 toll...it just takes longer for it to happen.  One would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat.  I will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working, it is great.

The machine gets one star for the dual brushes which I think are a positive for this machine. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me to keep it. It would have been cheaper for me to hire someone to come in and steam clean my carpet considering the fact I had to clean it three times and this carpet is in a low traffic area. I\u0027ve had a Hoover for 8-10 years and will look to see what new machines Hoover has on the market.\n",

Without exaggeration I have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece (breaks), a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly. It seems to fall apart, leak, and requires constant attention. I now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don\u0027t rotate. And this is with use maybe once a month. Frankly, I\u0027d be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable (and expensive) quality\n",

    "\nMy wife and I purchased the 40616 Hamilton Beach Perculator at K-Mart. After only 8 months of service the perculator would not keep the coffee hot--only luke warm.K-Mart refused to do anything about the problem because they only warranty the coffee pot for 90 days. This should give you an idea of what K-Mart thinks of the quality of the Hamilton Beach 40616 perculator.When I  called Hamilton Beach customer no-service I was told to send in the cord from the coffee pot and a check for $9.95 and they would replace their defective equipment. The $9.95\nis 25% of the original price of the perculator so I will decline their offer. If their perculator only last for 8 months I don\u0027t even want to pay the $9.95 to get a new one. I feel that it should have been replaced for free! In their warranty booklet they tell you that the 40616 perculator has a limited 2-year warranty but that is only if you are willing to pay $9.95 to ship their defective equipment back to them. Because of this experience with the Hamilton Beach 40616 coffee perculator I will never purchase any Hamilton Beach equipment in the future.I will also not purchase anything else from K-Mart\n",
    "\nI feel it was an unlucky day when I bought this pot.  As careful as I tried to be, it was extremely difficult to tell if I had correctly placed the stem (with basket) in the pit.  It had to be by \"feel,\" and half the time it was apparently a hair\u0027s breadth off and would not perk.  Or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet.  It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot.  A hair\u0027s breadth off and again it wouldn\u0027t perk.  So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds.

After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food.  I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish.

    "\nI bought this coffee maker to match my KitchenAid blender and coffee gridner. The coffee maker is attractive but works terribly. If you make more than 1 or 2 cups it overflows hot coffee onto the counter top. There is almost always grounds in the coffee too. When I called KitchenAid customer service they said they made a revision to fix the problems and sent me another one. It has the same problems. This is NOT user error I have tried different coffees, grinds, and positioning the carafe differently. This coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake. Finally I got KitchenAid to buy the coffee maker back and got a Cuisinart one. It works perfectly, costs less, and has more features.

    "\nI honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen\u0027s KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid\u0027s brand and durability behind it.  \n\nI use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn\u0027t be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It\u0027s done.  What an incredible dissappointment.\n\nBut, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool(?).  First, my dishwasher broke (3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer\u0027s seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re-routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues (loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.\n\nI did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don\u0027t make much of anything.  Everything is just a re-branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.\n\nFrom a once KitchenAid loyalist, avoid this product-- yes it\u0027s beautiful but it\u0027s not going to last.  Avoid all KitchenAid products because they really are not what they once were\n",

This must be an attempt to produce an interior more durable for using metal utensils with. An attempt that in my opinion is a failure. Things (like eggs and hamburgers) stick to this finish. You have to use a lot more fat to prevent sticking. It\u0027s hard to get clean, takes quite a bit of scrubbing even after soaking. It doesn\u0027t give the finish to grilled meats, etc that I want from a fry pan. Forget deglazing it to make a sauce.

I\u0027m now on my second coffee pot after KitchenAid sent me a new one when the one I ordered failed.

The carafe does not stay in place and slides forward when placed on the electric plate (until there is enough coffee dispensed. The coffee carafe is supposed to push (when it\u0027s in the right place) on the plastic piece that releases the coffee.  It\u0027s a design problem.  It\u0027s definitely cheaply made. I have to stand next to my coffee maker as it\u0027s brewing to make sure the coffee is dripping. \n\nBelieve me, I wouldn\u0027t have bothered writing this if I didn\u0027t think it might save someone else the headaches.

Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems.

Using finer grinds produces more and more leakage leaving only about half a carafe of extremely strong espresso which is indeed more like cowboy or french press coffees. -I enjoy cowboy coffee but would prefer espresso from my espresso machine plus I hate all the mess.\n\nThe Krups machine I had fifteen years ago worked well but this machine sucks big time. If you don\u0027t want to fork over a lot of bucks for a \"real\" espresso maker, try a Mr Coffee espresso machine. Mine, which I use when I travel, cost less than twenty dollars and does not leak.\n\nIn the meantime I have ordered a Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker to replace the Krups. -I\u0027ll keep you postsed.\n\nBilly Bat\n",
    "\nI jumped on purchasing this machine when I saw it. I was tired of storing beans in the freezer. I put 4 AA batteries in it and a pound of beans, closed the lid and the sucking sound started...and it kept going, and kept going, and kept going.

But I didn\u0027t have to worry, but the next morning the batteries were dead. I replaced them and within 24 hours they were all dead again!  There is no place to plug it in so you\u0027re stuck with using batteries.

It\u0027s huge and tall enough so a 12.5\" round cake that\u0027s about 5 inches high can fit in easily. The locking mechanism is also pretty neat. There\u0027s 3 of them so it makes it very easy to carry without any fuss of the cake dropping on the floor. The handle of the carrier also gives a comfortable grip.  Carrier is also see through so you\u0027ll notice if the decorations have been messed up during the transporting process.\n\nNOT so Good things:\nNOT very durable. Locking mechanism that holds the base of the carrier may crack making it non portable.\nThis product is susceptible to breakage perhaps because certain stores just have had these items on their shelf for a long time-- that\u0027s only my assumption. Plastic should not crack unless it\u0027s placed in extreme temperatures or is abused. Should the temperature in the fridge crack a plastic? Very unlikely don\u0027t you think?\nThe price is also far cry compared to other products sold by discount stores (i.e Linens../WlMrt. Other carriers are sold from $4-$9.\n\nThe height is good but it can be problematic when storing it in the fridge, but aren\u0027t all cakes difficult to store regardless?\n\nIn terms of cleaning the base, you\u0027ll need a brush to really get the bottom cleaned up\n",

The 8 in 1 does have alot of neat features, the issue is it doesn\u0027t do any of the features very well.  The toaster feature takes about 2 times as long to toast as a smaller, more conventional toaster oven.  The Rotisserie is difficult to use and the grease catcher woefully inadequate.

    "\nI have used the steamer once, and was disappointed at how long it took. The steam comes out weakly and splattered water on the garment several times. I was just trying to take the store creases out of a new pair of lightweight cotton trousers, and it took a lot of going over to get it done. I used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster. This one will probably work on heavier material like drapes, but it will take a very long time. I wouldn\u0027t buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items, and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job. A hand unit makes more sense to me, and you wouldn\u0027t have to maneuver that long hose. This is just one more large thing to store. I wish I could return it to Wal-mart, but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use\n",
    "\nI hate to iron and despise the cost of dry cleaning...so, I was really excited when I saw this steamer at CVS.  It was reasonably priced and sounded wonderful.  I was bragging about how much I loved this steamer after using it just once!  It was easy and fast....then, the second time I used it---Water everywhere!  \n\nWater started to spit and spray out of the (sealed and closed) base of the steamer.  I had turned the top to the locked position...but, the black rubber ring (supposed to keep the thing sealed?) was all twisted up---explaining why it wasn\u0027t working.  Well, I fixed that rubber thing back into place, but it still kept spraying boiling water.  SO, right now it\u0027s sitting in the corner waiting to be thrown out.  \n\nI\u0027m very frustrated with this product, but love the way that clothes steamers work.  It looks like I\u0027m going to have to bite the bullet and buy an expensive one.  But, how expensive should these things be?

    "\nI am a trained research assistant; therefore, I try to research products before I purchase them.  In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it.  I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice.  On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money.  The problems I had were:\n\n1.  The cord is too short: directions instruct user to hang nozzle on the door hook which hangs over the top of any door.  The nozzle would not reach to the top of the door, and I live in a mobile home, so it is not like I have the tallest doors in a home.\n\n2.  The most important thing in steaming a garment, for me, is to avoid the garment getting wet.  I did not fill the steamer to the maximum line, because I know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect.  After 2 minutes of waiting for the steam, I began to try it out on a silk blouse, and what a big mistake I made.  The water spat out on the material.  I thought that I should not hold the nozzle so close, but it did not matter, because water continued to spit out on the blouse.\n\n3.  The steam pressure would not dewrinkle the blouse.  The is not a case where the material was so hard to dewrinkle; it is silk, not that hard of a material.\n\nI have read other reviews, and if this machine worked for them, I don\u0027t know how, but I can attest to the operation of the steamer that I purchased.  I dabble in selling clothing on another website, and I have owned my other steamer since 2002, and I will continue to use it; I will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home.  Conair GS4 Compact is a bust.\n",

We had to use a knife/fork and 2 people to pry it out, doing some damage in the process.  I believe the Click Clack folks have developed a second or even third generation of these containers.

I washed it before using it, and after the water was done boiling, I saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird. The smell may have been caused by that black stuff. I washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out. I took one piece and noticed it was gooey. I checked if there was something that had melted when I boiled the water, but I saw the kettle was intact. I boiled more water and again I saw the black goo floating in the water. I have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times, and there is still goo floating in the water, they are almost unnoticeable, like very tiny dots, but they are there. At least the funny smell is gone. I don\u0027t know what that black goo is or what\u0027s causing it or where it\u0027s coming from.

    "\nI have read a few reviews about this machine and some how I am not sure what I missed. I purchased this machine about 8 months ago. I loved the look of it in my kitchen with all my stainless appliances. That is where it ends.\nThis machine has been terrible, when you put water in it the filter part floats up and out of the slot letting water get into the machine unfiltered. When your filling your cup you have to bend down in front of the machine to see where the coffee is in the cup or it will overflow, making more for you to clean up. I just want coffee!!!\n\nEven though the inside \"unit\" that holds the coffee does come out, it is not designed to fit into the front of a refrig to put water in it. You have to use something else to catch the water from the refrig then dump that into this machine. \nThey put little time into the design/research of this machine.  I hesitate to add this as I don\u0027t want anyone reading this to think my home is dirty....living in Florida we tend to see Palmetto bugs. This machine has about 5 vent holes in the top of it, I had two bugs get in the machine. They had full access to the water reservior. Once I filled the water reservior the bugs came flying out.

Eventually it started to drip and leak at random. The handle in the water/coffee holder broke. The top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously. Finally, this week it decided that it was not going to work at all. It will not make coffee. It will turn on, but not brew. I have only had this for a year and a half or so.

    "\nWe received the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 Cup Coffeemaker as a gift from my sister-in-law.  She loved hers and had used it for a few months so she bought one for us.  Shortly after buying this for us, her coffeemaker started leaking.  She thought it was just worn out from the six months of use and purchased a different type to replace hers.\n\nWe used our BrewStation for the first time yesterday.  The night before, I set it up and programmed it to make coffee at 5:00 AM - perfect, we could get up and have coffee already made.  It worked great.  A minor problem is that I enjoy coffee throughout the morning and the coffeemaker shut off after two hours.  Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, I just turned it back on and life was good.\n\nNow before I go on with my story, I need to explain how this coffeemaker works.  You pour the water into the first reservoir (for water only) using the coffee tank to measure the amount of water.  The coffee tank is placed back on the coffeemaker and the coffee filter and coffee is placed in a basket that fits on top of the coffee tank.  The coffee is made and held in the coffee tank.  To dispense the coffee, you place your cup below the tank and push on the dispenser button with your cup.  Coffee pours right into the cup.  Great idea, too bad it doesn\u0027t work as well as the concept!\n\nToday coffee was brewed at 5:00 AM again.  That\u0027s the only thing that worked well.  When my husband tried to get a cup of coffee it poured out and would not stop.  The cup overflowed, the coffee ran all over the counter and continued to flow until he unplugged it and put the entire coffeemaker in the sink.  It finally stopped pouring out when it ran out of coffee.  I\u0027ve cleaned the coffee tank and it continues to pour no matter what I do.  Since this coffeemaker runs just under $ 50, the twelve cups of coffee we\u0027ve made with it very expensive!\n\nI\u0027ve emailed Hamilton Beach and am awaiting an answer to this dilemma.  I need to purchase another coffeemaker today and it definitely won\u0027t be a Hamilton Beach brand.  I can\u0027t afford to purchase a new coffeemaker every other day!\n\nMy advice is to purchase a different brand and stay away from this one.

Also, the clip which holds it to the base just broke, and I see that I am not the first person to experience this problem.

The motor continued to work, but the blades stopped moving.  The knife has only been used 3 times, but I had to throw it out today.  I opened the plastic case, and found a metal worm gear coming off the motor shaft,and a cheap nylon gear attached to it to move the blades back and forth.  The nylon gear was stripped and the knife was useless. My prior knife, much less expensive, lasted for 18 years.  The Cuisinart knife is not well made and only works well when it is not under any stress. \n",

Too good to be rated 2 stars, isn\u0027t it? well that was the good.\nThe bad is: the tread that hold the cap is inside the conteiner so when you mix, the mixture go thru the tread (it doesn\u0027t look nice), and it\u0027s supposed to be hold in by a clear tiny silicon-like band that is attached to the cap. If you tighten the cap too much, the band will be squeezed out of position and leak. If you do not tighten it enough the band won\u0027t seal and leak.\nAnother thing, maybe not as important as the above, is that it is little uncomfortable to drink directly from the bottle, the lid keep closing everytime.\nSo before you make your decision analize carefully.

    "\nI bought this coffee pot after owning the older version of the grind and brew.  Silly of me to think this would be an improvement.  The front load basket design is terrible.  It is a true \"pain\" to clean this section, you cannot get your hands or any tool I have in my kitchen to clean the mechanisms.  Therefore, the brew basket sticks and at times the latch that holds the basket in will at times be gummed up.  Then when you start to brew your coffee thinking that the latch is closed, its not - its gummed up.  Not a problem until the heat and moisture from the brewing coffee loosen the gunk up and your basket shoots out and the coffee brews all over your counter.  As many times as hubby and I try to clean this its become too much of a pain, this coffee pot is out of here... and on its way to the curb.  I actually am contemplating sending it back to cuisinart in pieces!!!!!!\nPoor design.   Did I mention the coffee itself does not seem to have the same flavor as the other machine.  I think this one brews at a higher temp making the coffee bitter.\n\nMy advise as a seasoned coffee maker/drinker.  PASS save your money and your headaches\n",

That\u0027s not really a problem by itself, but when the iron leaves wrinkles on a shirt as much as it did, it becomes a big problem. The controls were hard to deal with. Turning the iron on and to the setting desired involved getting under the holder.

It was the kind of smell that you more feel in your nose than actually smell.  The smell also flavored the rice, which was most noticeable after letting it cool and airing out the apartment. Aside from this problem, though, the rice, which was standard japanese style white short grain, came out perfectly.\n\nI returned this cooker and ordered the Panasonic SR-NA18, which should arrive tomorrow.  I have compared a few rice cookers at my local asian store, and this Panasonic model seems better built than the newer (I believe) Panasonic SR-LA18, plus I believe it is made in Japan (I\u0027ll have to check when mine arrives).

    "\nBought the vacuum on oct 1 2005.  Brought it back to the store on Oct 7th. The belt broke! Thought it was a fluke. Tried one more...Brought it back after 10 days.  A piece went flying after using the hose. the suction on the hose then did not work!  Overall the cleaning was great.... while it worked. \n",
    "\nI bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Never had the carpet been so clean. It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited. \n\nOn the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. It cost me over $100 to repair. Beware buying this vacuum; repair shop owners will laugh when you bring it in because they see so many of them with broken belts and motors. Ignore what consumer reports says on this one and most definitley do not throw your money away on this piece of junk\n",
    "\nFirst of all I\u0027m a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).  When we bought our cabin I couldn\u0027t stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I\u0027m on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it\u0027s on except that it\u0027s noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the \"dirt container\" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it\u0027s catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I\u0027ve never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me \"Hoover\" spells \"DISAPPOINMENT\"\n",
    "\nThis is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had! It has continually broken down since I bought it and is now again dead. It\u0027s only 1 1/2 years old! While under warranty (the first year), I went through 5 belts, a roller brush, and the motor burned out. It is no longer under warranty, and of course, it broke down again. It smokes like it\u0027s on fire, and I believe that it\u0027s the roller brush *again*. Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don\u0027t have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week. I complained to Hoover and they basically told me \"too bad\". And it\u0027s not like it\u0027s an inexpensive vacuum at $289! \n\nI will never again buy a Hoover product\n",
    "\nThis one is doesn\u0027t work when it gets hot or wet (and where do you use YOUR thermometer?).\n\nAlso, it is very easy to leave it \"on\" draining the batteries.

It is auto off and saves the MAX and MIN temperatures.  The MAX is helpful when I want to check I steak on my HOT! grill.  I can hold the thermometer with a pair of thongs without burning my hands.\n\nThis one is just plain useless\n",

    "\nThe Breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states. To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14-15 minutes--still faster than a fridge though. Also, the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs, \"no messy ice\". I thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it--note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using. Also, you still need to add water and the freezer packs don\u0027t really last that long. If you want to chill more than 1 bottle, I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent. Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can/bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water. Also, if you are chilling allot of beverages, there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts--they should put a drain spout at the bottom--I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink. It does work being faster than your fridge or freezer, but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated\n",
    "\nI tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm. They say chill, but what does that really mean? They should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes. I guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer. Also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work.\n",
    "\nThe description does not tell you that you still have to add water to unit in addition to the gel packs. I chilled my chardonnay for seven minutes and it was still warm. I had to chill it for 20 minutes to get it cold enough to drink. Gel packs don\u0027t allow you to chill several bottles without having to refreeze them or add ice to the machine.\n",

As soon as you start mixing, your food goes  sliding up and over the side.  Also, for the extreme weight, the handle  should be wider; distributing the weight a little more broadly for the weak  hand hold.  I gave mine away after three months.

    "\nI bought this thing due to my inablity to handle heat effectively anymore like I used to. The unit was not deffective or anything like that, but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small. While it is stated in the manual that it\u0027s not an A/C unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation. I found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective. The fan at the back of the unit doesn\u0027t have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything. While the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck I find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers. Overall, the unit just keeps your neck wet and doesn\u0027t really cool anything. I found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still. Anything over 85 degrees and it fails.\nDon\u0027t waste your money on this thing until someone comes out with a better system\n",
    "\nI should have listened to the other reviewers, which I usually do. I followed the directions to the letter. Put it on in 95+ degree weather and never felt cool at all.

    "\nI cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished Roomba Discovery 4210. While I think the product did a good job on BARE floors (not carpet), now after only 4 months of light use (we only used in the kitchen/den area of our home), the unit is trashed. The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that\u0027s apparently all the machine is good for. I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out, but it did nothing. This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was \"probably trashed\". She was right. If you want  to try this machine stick with the new one, at least you\u0027ll get a one year warranty. But I recommend staying away altogether\n",

I disliked it from the beginning. Why? 1) It\u0027s heavy. 2) When you open the lid to fill it with water (you shouldn\u0027t fill it just through the spout because then all the deposits are on the wrong side of the filter), water that has collected around the lid leaks out and runs down the outside of the kettle. 3) After less than 2 years of use, it is no longer working properly.

    "\nI, too, am SO disappointed with this product. When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren\u0027t as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we\u0027d always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn\u0027t work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner\u0027s manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we\u0027ll have to return this oven as well, and we\u0027ve pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all\n",
    "\nThe product is labeled as a seed grinder, so you would expect it to be able to grind seeds, but it failed miserably. I tried grinding flax seeds (about the size of sesame seeds) but about half of the flax seeds made it through the grinder intact. I even tried running the \"ground\" seeds through a second and third time but still wound up with a large portion of whole or almost intact seeds. That was with the grinder on the fine setting. It seems to be a combination of poor design and cheap parts. The \"grinding\" wheels are made of plastic which is not the best material for friction and the design allows a lot of the seeds to drop off the wheel into the chute without having actually been \"ground\" by the wheels. If you\u0027re wanting to grind a very small amount of seeds, try a manual grinder. If you\u0027re wanting to grind a medium to large amount of seeds, spend more money and get a proper flour mill\n",

These cracks developed very soon after I bought them, and I only ever washed them in on the top rack of the dishwasher. Because of the design of the cups, it\u0027s kinda annoying to wash them by hand - and they\u0027re not great for measuring dry ingredients for the same reason. So mine have gone into the garbage can, replaced by the KitchenAid cups of similar appearance (although without the handy interior measuring marks). My advice, keep your receipt if you buy these.

    "\nAfter me first coffeemaker began leaking- and it was a realtively new proctor-silex 12 cup maker- I decided to try one of these \"cute\" single serve ones.  Why, oh why did I purchase this brand??  First, it does take around 3-4 minutes to brew a single cup of coffee or tea.  This seems like a longer time than most.  And now, after 2 or 3 frustrating weeks, it\u0027s leaking just like the old one did.  Not user error, as the water comes from underneath the coffeemaker.  Also, the coffee is not coming out as hot either, which causes me to wonder if it\u0027s the heating element...  Even though this one can use loose grounds or pods, it is not worth the frustration!  Try a different brand.  My sister-in-law has really enjoyed her Sensao!\n",
    "\nAbsolutely horrible! The worst $20 I\u0027ve every spent.  This machine is an absolute waste of money.  I have had this machine fore 2 weeks and still have not found a cup small to fit it, they are all either too wide or too tall. A total headache when your rushing out to work\n",
    "\nWhen something says \u0027white\u0027 I sort of expect to get something close to the colour white. I ordered three of these plates but they are closer to beige. They also have an odd matte finish that made them seem cheaply. However, they are large plates and at this price, probably good for entertaining if you need quite a few. The large ones would be good for holiday meals - those times when you really need extra serving pieces that you don\u0027t use the rest of the year\n",

It is not a good design for car use.  On the plus side I like the no-handle design and it has a small base which should fit most cupholders.  On the down side you need 2 hands to twist the lid open or closed.  Also the \u0027dribble-proof\u0027 design means that the mug has a very deep lip, and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing\n",

My wife and I prepare one large smoothie everyday that has no ice, but lots of frozen berries, fresh fruit, etc. Nothing else goes in the blender. This blender looked nice and was so heavy it implied quality. It even worked great for a few months. Then one day the gear that delivers power from the base to the jar stripped right off. Now it is out of warranty. This is not simple to replace since the plastic/rubber piece separated from the steel shaft. We paid close to $100 for this thing so spending a couple of hours bringing it to someone who will charge $25-$50 to repair it seems like throwing good money after bad.  \n\nThis blender,like many others that I will not waste anymore time reviewing, is described as heavy duty, industrial or commercial grade.  None-I repeat-none of the ones sold at your retail store are comparable to the better commercial models. Save yourself time and money and buy the real commercial models that will last you a lifetime.  You can easily find quite a few brands and reviews on the internet. The ones used in restaurants, bars and other food service businesses are constructed to a higher standard and have replaceable parts that are readily available over the internet. Be prepared to pay $200-$500.\n\nFor someone who only occasionally will use a blender to make margaritas  this may be a very useful blender.\n\n \n",

I am not a \"speed\" baker of any sort, but I have four kids and do like to make birthday cakes, muffins, cookies, etc. My old sifter was so old it was getting flecks of rust into the flour, so I started looking for a new one. I chose this one after reading all the online reviews, and even though I saw that a few people found it slow, I was not prepared for how slow it really is! I just sifted 3+ cups of confectioner\u0027s sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes. As another reviewer said, in order to make it go faster I shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired. (I have never ever been tired out from BAKING before, fer\u0027 pete\u0027s sake!!!) I\u0027m not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually USED a sifter. I\u0027m stuck with the thing now, I suppose, so I\u0027ll learn to just go slower. But it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter - which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side. The one thing I really like is the caps for both ends - an innovation I\u0027m surprised nobody else has come up with. But that doesn\u0027t redeem the product for me. In fact, if I can put my hands on another one of those old-fashioned ones (at a thrift store, maybe) I\u0027ll snap it up and put this new one in the Goodwill bin.\n",

This means that all functions behave at their default settings--no temperature or time adjustments.  Luckily, the default setting for toast is just barely on the brown side for us, still edible.

    "\nThis blender is very weak. It has a small blade that cannot pull down anything of substance and I had to stir even soft fruit in liquid or it would never get cut up -- just the bottom part of the mix spins around. I used this blender four times since August 2006 (when I bought it) to make \u0027smoothies\u0027, always with poor results. As the other reviewer said, the fruit stays lumpy. The little blades aren\u0027t strong enough. Yesterday I wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup. Of course they are thick and starchy, but after the usual \u0027stirring\u0027 to get them to move through the blender, the speed buttons started to vibrate and I could smell the unit getting hot. I wasn\u0027t overworking it -- mainly pulsing and then running it for about 30 seconds. All of a sudden, it wouldn\u0027t work any more. It just burned out. If you actually cook and expect a blender to blend things, don\u0027t buy this blender. I\u0027m going to see if Amazon will take it back. (Note: after I wrote this, I was told by Amazon that I had to get in touch with the manufacturer, which I could do because it was within 90 days of purchase. However, the company wants me to mail in the plug and $5 for \u0027shipping\u0027 to get a replacement, which obviously I don\u0027t want. Why would I want to pay $5 more for a product that didn\u0027t work the first time? Why would I want the product again at all? Amazon would have taken it back, but they wanted it returned in the box, which I threw out. I\u0027m even more dissatisfied with this product now than when I wrote this review originally. Maybe I can make it into an interesting planter and sell it at a craft fair . . . \n",

    "\nI bought this teapot from Amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times.  The material is great, heat retention is good, it looks very nice, and I had no problems cleaning it (I use a babybottle brush).  \n\nThe tea infuser is not very effective though.  The holes are a bit on the large side, so any broken bits from whole tea leaves can still pass through.  And the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves, especially when I\u0027m not planning to fill the pot to the brim (it doesn\u0027t extend deep enough).  So I don\u0027t use it at all (I put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as I pour).\n\nHowever, my biggest gripe is that the spout does tend to dribble after you pour.  So you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours, ending up with a wet spot on your table/counter.  I have to make sure I either wipe the spout in between pours, or set it on a dishtowel/paper napkin (unless I\u0027m planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session).  I found that pretty annoying.\n\nSo in conclusion, for the price I paid for this teapot\u0027s supposedly wonderful features, I don\u0027t think it was a good buy.\n",
    "\nYes, it is pretty. No, it is not a good teapot. I have made tea for over 40 years, in all sorts of pots, and this is right up there with the worst. It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up\n",

    "\nI bought this box about 4 months ago and stopped using it about 2 months ago. It turned out to be more work than just a regular box. At least you can wash out a regular box and start over clean. Good luck with completely cleaning all the poo crumbs from the sliding track and cheap gears. It gets to be a disgusting affair, more than with a regular box. \n\nAs other reviews said the rake only goes over the top half of the litter so there\u0027s tons of sticky cement left at the bottom which you have to manually scrape out. It was often unable to push the clumps into the bin. So it would just very noisily push until it got stuck, back up, and then start over again like 10 times in a row. When it does get clumps into the bin, it also pushes tons of litter through the crack between the bin and the box and then you\u0027re left with a huge pile of litter underneath the box. To clean it, you have to take it apart. The top part houses a computer so you can\u0027t soak it which means there\u0027s poo always stuck in the crevices. Ever see Office Space? At the end of two months I was ready to bring this thing out in a field and bash it with a sledgehammer. \n\nNow we\u0027re looking for another box. Currently, we are just using the plastic box from the littermaid without the rake, etc. This is my worst investment to date.\n",
    "\nThe Professional label on this product is a big misnomer.\n\nAsk frequent sewers and quilters what they hated the most about the last iron they replaced and they will almost invariably refer to leaking and the auto-shutoff feature if present.  Typically, they press seams as a batch and go back to sewing... only to return to a iron that has shut off and requires a reheating cycle. \n\nThe auto-shutoff on this model makes it poorly suited for the sewing room where the \u0027professional\u0027 label should apply.\n\nThis (and other) Rowenta iron produces good steam and can burst steam to a certain extent.  However, usually between 6 months and 1.5 yrs, Rowentas begin to drip.  The valve design just doesn\u0027t hold up to water hardness that long. Failure number two.\n\nFor garment sewers and quilters, a professional system with a separate water boiler (tank) works far better:\n* won\u0027t shut off on you\n* since the iron doesn\u0027t make the steam (the boiler does), the sole doesn\u0027t have the \u0027hot spot\u0027 where household irons drip the water to make steam, which tends to scorch fabrics\n* true professional models have a thicker sole which will maintain a more even temperature (still without the hot spot)\n\nI teach sewing classes (garment, home dec, totes, etc.) and have completely walked away from household iron designs like this one.  You will not see this type of iron in a commercial workshop.  Noone there would have the time to wait for the iron to get hot again every time you\u0027ve been away from it.\n\nThis iron is a better than average housesold model, designed for \u0027ironing\u0027 your laundry and not for pressing in a sewing room.\n\nFor general ironing duty (like laundry), check out the T-Fal 1759 Ultraglide Diffusion Iron for about half the price.  My t-fal irons (i\u0027ve had 2) have outlasted my Rowenta iron, with just as good a performance and with the advantage of the ultraglide sole, a ceramic-like sole coating that does not scratch, even  over metal zippers (the stainless steal sole on the rowenta WILL scratch over metal zipper)\n\nRating this (and similar) Rowenta as a conventional household iron:\nPerformance 5\nDurability  3 (before it begins dripping)\n\nAs a sewing room iron: 2\n\nOverall Rating: 2 (because they label the product as professional, where it fails to the task)\n\nP.S.:  for any household iron, be sure to empty the water tank after use to prolong the life of your iron.  Leaving water in the tank leads to premature wear of valves and seals\n",

Unfortunately, my glee turned sour when I tried to use my new egg rings.\n\nA lot of people report they haven\u0027t had a problem with sticking, but that is not consistant with my experience.  Eggs stick to virtually everything, and these rings are no exception.  Trying to remove the ring and flip the egg is a pain, usually I flip the ring and the egg flips with it, and then I have to cut the egg away from the ring so it falls down to the pan\n",
    "\nWell, it started off a fairytale.  This small vacuum has a lot of power.  Unfortunatley, I think I have permanant hearing damage from the volume of this vacuum.  It is EXTREMELY loud, it terrified my pets and I had ringing in my ears after using it.  It worked very well for about 6 months and then pooped out on me.  I\u0027m not sure if the motor gave out or what, but the suction doesn\u0027t work even though the brushes still spin.  THE FILTER IS A PAIN!  I run a rabbit rescue and deal with a lot of pet hair, it just clogs up way to fast.  If you have a small apartment with merely area rugs, this might be ok, just make sure you buy some ear plugs.  YIKES.\n",

    "\nThis product is junk.  I like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed.  The hadle is spot welded and can not hold any weight.  My second one broke after shaking the remains of a stock out.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve used these type of units all the time until I got my own.  It stopped sealing, and I haven\u0027t had a chance to use up the bags that came with it!  When I called, they said it was probably the heat tape that went bad and they can\u0027t fix it.  They offered to sell me a new one though!  I have no idea where my receipt is (my fault).  I have to have another one, so I\u0027m going to buy the cheapest one so I don\u0027t feel so bad when I have to replace it in 6 months to a year\n",
    "\nWhen I received my set of Mini Springform pans I was very excited.  I couldn\u0027t wait to get started on some wonderful deserts.  And as expected the results were great.     Only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves.  Not only did I notice rust on the release hinges, but the rims on the collars were warped.  At first I thought I could live with this, but a friend pointed out it could only get worse.     I am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment, but these definitely do not make the grade.  Admitedly the results of my first time use were great, but I just don\u0027t feel these pans will last.     I hate buying something and knowing I will have to replace it soon.  And that is exactly the way I felt with these pans\n",
    "\nI purchased this after looking at all of the reviews. What a mistake! After using this to cook single cup servings of several types of rice, there was one thing in common - a huge mess. Even after rinsing the raw rice several times, the unit still spatters out to about a two foot radius. I may try it with a wet dish towel on top to contain the mess, or I may just stick it in the basement and forget about it\n",
    "\nThis carafe keeps beverages warm enough.  The problem I\u0027m having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position.  The instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue, although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid.  Despite following these instructions the push button still sticks.  To get the lid to close now after I\u0027m done pouring I have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe.  Very poor design in my opinion.  I wouldn\u0027t buy another Zojirushi product based on this experience.\n",
    "\nSimply put, it doesn\u0027t work. Well, perhaps it can work on some types of fabrics/garments in very specific (or limited) situations, but it didn\u0027t work on mine. \n\nYou can\u0027t manage to get a continuous flow of steam, even if you keep on pumping the button frequently (what it doesn\u0027t support, as a matter of fact, because there\u0027s a limit of bursts of steam it can shoot out in a row before \"reloading\"). \n\nI returned it to seller (Brand Variety, that refunded me without problems, no question asked).\n\nNot recommended\n",
    "\nI have purchased this item twice. The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty. The grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire. There is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it. The same is true of all brands.. Models sold as \"wireless\" are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill.  Somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire. That said, before it becomes useless, it works really well. Maybe the idea is to buy these by the case?\n",
    "\nI\u0027ve had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great. But inevitably the probes fail. You will think its your fault and probably buy a new one. But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.\n\nOne solution I\u0027ve tried that works pretty well, is to keep your receipt, and when the probe fails, take it back where you bought it for a replacement.\n",
    "\nWhile it worked, it worked great.  But then it stopped working.  Only 10 months of use.  Ordered a new probe, but that didn\u0027t work.  Now, it\u0027s just an expensive timer.  Would\u0027ve received three stars, but the Polder site and service not helpful.  Will try the Taylor model, good luck with analog Taylor thermometers.  Once you get used to these types of thermometers, it\u0027s hard to go back.  The precision in cooking, especially for chicken and pork, can make a big difference\n",
    "\nI purchased this wok for my husband\u0027s Christmas present.  It was lovely, we cooked two meals in it Christmas day.  Nice heat transfer, beautiful on the table (but big).  That night, he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan.  It\u0027s considerably narrower than the normal Le Creuset handle.  Back it went to Williams Sonoma, where there were a few other L.C. woks with similar cracks!  Phooey to you, Le Creuset.\n\nI wish I could find another glass lidded Joyce Chen wok - my old one was the best, before it was dropped one too many times\n",
    "\nWe received 3 sets of this for a wedding present.  I really liked how the polished silver shined and how they felt in your hand.   However,  after just one wash there were quite a few that had rust spots.   After two more washes the rust got worse.  These are supposed to be dishwasher safe!  There are recommendations to hand wash these and dry them, but who has the time for that these days?  Despite the apeal of the set, we decided to try something else.   It\u0027s a shame because it\u0027s such a pretty set (before the wash of course!). \n",
    "\nI bought two sets of these about 4 months ago.  After the first time in the dishwasher I noticed little tarnish/rusty looking spots.

Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you. If you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans\n",
    "\nI bought this pan because it was non-stick, plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel.  I bake my usual brownies and cookies and they all stuck to the pan.  It stuck more than my glass pyrex casserole pans.  It was not easy to get it off, I had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle.  Definitely not non-stick.  The air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning, which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie, which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together.\n\nOn the up side, this pan doesn\u0027t warp if you are baking at 350 degrees of below.  \n\nI am returning this item, I wanted non-stick and this definitel was not.\n\n",
    "\nWe just replaced our entire kitchen dishware with the Sango Brown - Mistake...even bought the added pieces...well, we ONLY hand wash them (we have a dishwasher but rarely use it).  In the first week, a plate broke in half right down the middle...then a week later, a second...and tonight, a third..all three directly down the middle of the plate while HAND washing..(not rough washing either).  I have a call into Sango and hopefully they will resolve it.  After reading the reviews here, I would have to agree that its not worth the danger of broken dishes (My wife sliced her finger pretty good on the second broken one) to buy these.  I am going to try to find a set that will go with ALL THE EXTRAS I bought from Sango..I am HOPING I don\u0027t have to replace everything!  What a mess!

I purchased the 900S because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well (8 years).\nPros:\nIt makes a good loaf of bread.\nGood selection of cycles.\nLoaf is easy to extract from the pan.\n\nCons:\nThe motor is not very powerful.  It lugs down when making whole wheat bread.\nAfter 7 months of operation the Teflon wore off the mixing paddle.\nAt 11 months the bearing failed in the mixing pan.\n\nOverall I am disappointed in this bread machine and I could not recommend it\n",
    "\nNot sure how other people have been able to make a real loaf of bread with this, but I certainly could not.  I made three attempts, all failures for various reasons.  Either it did not mix, or the dough was so hard it knocked the pan off its base, or it created pebbles of dough.  It definitely can not be left unattended, which defeats the purpose of delay start.  It bakes OK though, but you better do all the upfront work yourself.  PS. I was using the recipes that come with the maker\n",
    "\nWe liked the idea that the caraffe didn\u0027t need to be heated from below... a big plus with this unit.  But.... we have had some serious problems with the filter backing up and the water leaking over the top of it everywhere on the counter.  A FLOOD of coffee.  We thought that it might be the filter holes were clogged... so we made sure they were rinsed out well and could easily flow a stream through them.  But then we had a flood again on the counter.  So we thought that maybe our filters were\u0027nt good... so we bought other ones.  And them we had another big flood of coffee (this has proven to be very staining to our white grouting).  So we thought perhaps we were grinding our coffee too fine and it was packing down too tight.... so we ground it coarser... and yet, ANOTHER DANG FLOOD. We have followed the instructions perfectly... and still these overflows.\n\nSo now we are ticked... we have never had this headache with a coffee maker before.... and all we want is some coffee in the morning.  So we\u0027re going to try and return the stupid thing (our reciept and box are long gone). Sure hope we can get an exchange... and certainly NOT another one of these.\n\nOh... and the mugs that come with it don\u0027t have handles on them like the ones in the picture do\n",

So I followed the calibration instructions and was only able to get the display to read 34.1 degrees in a 32 degree solution... ok, so I can live with 2.1 degree inaccuracy.  After calibrating, the room temperature was also only off by about 2 degrees.  However, I decided to test it in boiling water and the display read 193 degrees (water boils at 212F).  So, If you are counting on this thermometer to tell you anything important (such as if your meat is cooked suffiently or if your beer water is the right temperature for steeping), I would make sure it is accurate at the temperature of interest before using... or avoid it all together, which I wish I had done\n",

    "\nI bought three of these when I saw them in a local store, thinking them a great deal. They LOOK like the equivalent of the Henckels, solid and sturdy, at one-fifth the price. Looks can be deceiving. They are suitable for paper, skin, aluminum foil, etc., but do not try them on anything more substantial, like chicken leg bones. I broke these on items that I routinely cut through with my Henckels and Wusthof shears. The cost of sending them back under warranty was about the purchase cost, so I tossed out all three pairs. \n\nSorry, Chicago Cutlery, but if you are selling office scissors, label them that way. I expect kitchen shears to be a LOT tougher, so I can\u0027t mark these more than one star. Chicago Cutlery makes a pair of scissors called the Insignia series, for only about $2-3 more. I suggest potential buyers look into these, or spring for the more expensive German brands\n",

We had to throw the whole machine out.  Now I will be buying a new machine, being that I enjoyed the convenience of the spout but if I can\u0027t find one thats non plastic I will use my blender.  The smoothie maker makes less of a mess for drinks, a blender always doesnt pour as nice. I will not buy another plastic model again.

It even dominates over the smell of the cake or bread that I am making! I have also noticed (especially with this bread pan) that the silicone gives your dessert a slight silicone taste.

    "\nI am writing this to warn all of you cooks and bakers at home, that like me, prefer real commercial equipment in your kitchen.  Anything less is just a toy.  I had purchased the Waring Pro 1500 convection oven thinking this would be a quality convection oven to replace a Farberware convection oven that I have had for over 10 years and just plain wore out.  I ordered the Waring Pro 1500 from a catalog/online store other than Amazon, I don\u0027t know if it is legal to say, but it does have the word Chef\u0027s in it.  I was so excited to get it!  I opened the box, set it up, and was so disappointed.  It was made so poorly I was just sick.  The stainless steel top was not smoothed out, the oven door was installed so crooked it scraped the metal off of the side of the controls, and it had been dropped or something before packing because the feet were up inside of the thing, and the top was bent down.  The shipping packaging was fine, there was no broken packing and the box was fine.  OK, so I sent that one back, got a replacement thanks to the wonderful customer service at the online store, and opened the second one, same thing!!  I was so devastated, that I decided to give it a shot anyhow.  While cooking with it, the door had such a bad seal that it just steamed out the front, sides and bottom.  I was amazed that there could be such shoddy workmanship out there on what was being advertised as commercial quality.  OK, so oven number two went back, and I tried one more, what the heck three strikes you are out right?  Right!!  Finally oven number three came and it was put together so much better, seal looked good, top and feet looked good, so I decided to give it a whirl.  Once again, huge disappointment.  The convection fan goes on and off with the burner coils.  Thus not giving the cooking cycle a true convection.  I called Waring customer service and it was confirmed by engineering that they designed the fan to come on and off with the coils.  Bad design!  It took longer to bake cookies in there than it would my regular oven, and then they were hard and dry.  I rotisseried a chicken and it took over 1 and a half hours and when I cut it, the skin was soggy, not crisp, and it wasn\u0027t cooked all the way through after 90 minutes!  The thing popped (sounded like it was going to blow up) every time it heated up because they riveted the rack holders in there so tight, also making it nearly impossible to go from racks to using baking trays.  OK, that was it!!  After extensive internet research, I finally found a convection oven that is truly a commercial oven made for residential use, and exchanged it with the wonderful catalog/online store mentioned before and got the Cadco Commercial (and I do mean Commercial) half size convection oven Model number OV-350 and have used it many times since it\u0027s arrival and absolutely love it!!  I know it is twice the price, but as usual, you get what you pay for.  There is a smaller size version of the Cadco/Broilking oven that is quarter size, for people that do not need to bake huge quantities like me, that is the same price as the Waring Pro.  Please people, if you are at all a person that demands quality in your kitchen, do not waste your time on the Waring Pro, just skip right to the real commercial stuff and save yourself some major stress!!  Thanks again to the wonderful customer service at the aforementioned catalong/online company for NOT making me be stuck with the worthless Waring PRO 1500!!  Go for the Cadco!   \n",
    "\nWe never even plugged this sucker in.  I wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan, and this unit was supposed to do that.

    "\nThe FS150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you don\u0027t push this unit too hard or use it too frequently. Ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out. The two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor/gear train. First the slider is simply a  cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly. We found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards. Food grade Teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil.\nThe big problem with this unit is the motor/gear train that drives the slicing wheel. The drive gear is plastic and will not tolerate any kind of continuous load and will strip out fairly easily if pushed too hard. We smoked the motor and stripped the gears just slicing up a couple of small roasts and we were not working the unit that hard. \nIt does a decent job for the person that just wants to slice up a small bunch of deli foods for a party or do a weeks worth of cheese for the kids lunches but honestly a good knife will do just as well and not set you back ten minutes for cleaning every time you use it.\nIf you are looking for a slicer to do more serious work you will have to spend the money and get something in the $400+ range. What this slicer is good for the deli counter can do for you for free when you buy your bologna. \n",
    "\nI was actually satisfied with this slicer until I needed to clean it.  When you remove the blade, there is a plastic ring or seal that clings to a metal rim with brittle, plastic \"fingers\".  An intelligent engineer would have seated this ring in a channel rather than have it mounted by flimsy, brittle fingers to a thin semi-circle of metal.\n\nMine broke on the 4th cleaning; now the blade is extremly difficult to align, and it wobbles if you leave the part off.  Waring\u0027s website does not offer this part for sale, and customer service has not yet returned my call.\n\nUpdated March 24, 2006:  Customer service told me to clean this slicer by removing the three mounting screws rather than using the center screw.  This is more difficult, and does not permit you to clean accumulated goop that gets behind the seal.\n\nThey did send me a new ring or seal, but I had to eventually remove the whole blade when the smell of the goop became too strong.  All of the fingers had broken off the seal, so I had to use duct tape to reapply it.  And the blade really wobbles now.\n\nI see a few people really liked this slicer; I suspect they had not cleaned it before writing\n",
    "\nThis thing slices well, then comes the impractical task of trying to clean it. The tray does not detatch from the base, which cannot be put in water because it containes the motor. Pieces of food work their way into the motor area. After removing the blade (using tools) you must remove a plastic cover with 3 screws and dig out the pieces of food. I could not believe how bad a design it was from a cleaning standpoint. The tray that slides back and forth with the food has a stainless top that is literally two-faced taped onto the plastic base. This was very poor from a quality standpoint, and came off in my hand the first and only time used. The plastic base for this tray has about fifty little half inch square honey-comb sort of areas that grease from meat or juices from food WILL get down into. This thing is a nightmare to adequately clean and not worth the trouble. It went back to the store immediately, and it was not all the way clean because after about thirty minutes I gave up. I\u0027m looking for another brand now\n",
    "\nI bought this product because the box says \"no more ice chunks.\" There is even an \"icebreaker\" setting.  I wanted a way to make slushies.  However, the manual says you are to use the \"icy drink\" setting when crushing ice.  I am not sure if or when a person is supposed to use the \"icebreaker\" setting!\n  Also, the whole ice crushing process requires many steps and more than a blender.  First, you have to pour water in before you can crush the ice.  Once you press the \"icy drink\" setting, you pour out the excess water into a collander.\n  Even after all that, there are chunks in the ice. No slushie for me!\n  I gave this product just 1 star because I hate misleading advertising.  I will now have to take time out of my crammed schedule to return this product\n",

    "\nLet me begin with a positive note on the OXO Good Grips oven mitt:  It looks great and the magnet is a good idea. Now for the negative aspects of this item:  it\u0027s WAY over-priced, especially for how poorly it is designed. The way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a \"Good Grip,\" which is ironic since it\u0027s called the \"OXO Good Grips\" oven mitt.  It\u0027s hard to explain, but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt, you cannot easily grab things, especially if what you\u0027re trying to grab is small (like a pan lid) or narrow (like the handles on a roaster pan).  It\u0027s like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven. I decided not to give it one star ONLY because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures.  I strongly suggest that if you are considering purchasing this OXO mitt, you should go to a store and try it on first to see what you think about the design. \n",

The only use would be to throw the rings away and just use it as a regular pan.  Don\u0027t waste your money\n",

    "\nThis unit from Cooking.com is made from China.  Consider it to be a disposable unit.  The threads on it are worthless.  I got one single use out of them.  I thought it to be a fluke.  Ordered another one.  Same thing.  Frustrated!  \nI located a German Made Cast Iron Rosette Iron online, from another reviewer.  There is a world of differences, between the $10.00 China junk knockoff and the German made one.  It is my opinion that the German Rosette Iron is worth every penny!  The German Made Cast Iron Rosette will no doubt be handed down for generations to come.  The threads alone are worth the higher price; however the quality is significantly noticeable.  The German made set is a much heavier set than the China made set from Cooking.com.  It is my opinion that it is worth your time to do a bit more research than for settling for this Chinese knockoff.  Don\u0027t get me wrong - they are still better than Aluminum any day of the week - but if you have ever owned an Alfred Andresen \u0026 Co Cast Iron Rosette set - you\u0027ll instantly know what I am talking about.  \n",

    "\nI purchased this egg cooker specifically for poaching 2 eggs. I used large, farm-fresh eggs. Whatever combination of water and timing I tried, I never got a perfectly cooked poached egg. The Cuisinart instruction book is confusing in its layout - specifically page 5. I called Cuisinart and after much back and forth, it was determined the eggs I used were too large and the directions were for MEDIUM-sized eggs. If considering this machine, be aware you might have to sacrifice the eggs you want to eat.\n",
    "\nThe Cuisinart egg cooker:\n- over/under cook the eggs according to its measuring cup\n- plastic tray deforms after it\u0027s heated (and stays deformed)\n- the metal cover burns your hand\n- is $10 more expensive than the Krups 230-70 Egg Express Egg Cooker, which is a much better product than Cuisinar\n",
    "\nThis stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream - built with quality materials like real metal (not silvery plastic), and sporting a sophisticated, drop-dead gorgeous retro appeal.  It looks equally as impressive in the hippest New York loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of Williams-Sonoma. \n\nHowever, as is the case when function follows form, this is a horrible blender.  Don\u0027t get me wrong - I\u0027m more than willing to forgive a modicum of piss-poor functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant.  But quite frankly, this blender is beyond bad.\n\nMost unfortunate is the blender\u0027s propensity to splash everywhere - even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand.  It seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing; it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor.  I suspect that the unit\u0027s quasi-industrial motor may be a contributing factor; it only supports two speeds: off, and jet-cyclonic.  While I admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right, the consequences of omitting ramp-up speeds are overbearing, consistently messy, predictably inconvenient, and potentially dangerous (as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing).  The irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward; and the blender\u0027s poorly-sealed lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion.  In fact, this blender splashes so profusely that it\u0027s nearly unusable.\n\nIt\u0027s too bad, because superficially, this blender really is quite the objet d\u0027art.  But when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance, it has a long way to go - even in comparison to a $29 Oster.  \n\nIf I had to summarize this blender as accurately, succinctly, and fairly as possible, I\u0027d distill it down to one word - \"regrettable.\"\n",
    "\n\"Warring\" has a high reputation for being a powerful blender. I purchased because of its reputation. But it turned out to be actually not that powerful and may not be as powerful as the one I had before which only costed $30.

    "\nWe lived in Asia for five years and we eat a lot of rice.  In Asia we owned a very cheap rice cooker that worked perfectly well (but different voltage).  When we returned to the USA, I purchased the cuisinart 8-cup rice cooker (CRC-800) thinking I was getting \"top of the line.\"  It made such an enormous mess every time we used it, so I called cuisnart to find out if somehow (despite meticulous reading of the instructions) we were doing something wrong.  No, it seemed we were doing everything correctly.  So we tried a few more times, and then in exasperation returned the rice cooker for a new one.  We thought given the generally good quality of cuisinart appliances, this one must be defective.  \nWell the new one does the same thing!  I give up.  Enough of the messes.  I got so frustrated I sent cuisinart a picture.  C\u0027mon this is not high-tech stuff!  Get it right or take it off the market\n",

    "\nDo not waste your time in purchasing this product.  At first, I thought this would be a great kitchen gadget for making small cones for my kids or when I just want a little treat, but I was wrong.  The manufacture didn\u0027t think that as soon as the waffles are done, you have to be quick and roll the waffles into cones for it too cool.  Well, instead of making one, you have to roll three in enough time before it cools.  I tried numerous times to roll each one quickly as possible, but by the second one the third waffle is cooled and has not had the chance to be rolled up into a cone.  It really is not smart for the manufacture to sell this product, unless it comes with three cone makers to wrap the waffle in.  And, to state that you need three people to make it or it will not work.  Do not bother purchasing this product, unless you are an expert cone maker.  I did, however, went ahead and purchased the regular sized cone maker.  It is hard to perfect the perfect cone without having a hole at the bottom, but at least I have time to wrap up one cone at a time without having it cool on me to quickly.  Also, the petite cone waffle maker is rediculously too small to try to wrap.  It really is a waste of energy.  You could put batter in only one of the cone indentions, and do it one by one if its what you are looking for.  That could work.  All in all, personally it wasn\u0027t worth my time and money spent on the thing\n",

    "\nI researched a lot before buying this slow cooker. I have a Nesco roaster that I love and use often. I needed a large slow cooker. I started researching. Started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot. I wanted a good one. The Cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and I thought well even it cooks faster that is fine. I will just watch it until I get used to it and go from there. Every dish I have watched..they all cooked in LESS than half the allotted time. Today I made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within ONE HOUR. Way too hot. I called Cuisinart several times and they said I may have a defective unit. Well I doubt it. I just think it runs hot. I really was dismayed because I love the size and the design of this cooker. Really was not up to par with Cuisinart products that I know and love. \n\nLet me also say that I am a good cook. I feel that I know my way around any appliance. I was not happy that I was not going to be able to leave this cooker all day but I was ok to give it a try. It is not at all what I expected. I read the other reviews here and wish I would have taken heed of them. I had read good reviews elsewhere and saw two articles in magazines on this cooker being the best. \n\nIf you are going to spend 100 bucks on a slow cooker, stop, get one of the higher end rival ones with a timer and then get a nesco roaster. You can cook anything all summer without heating up your kitchen.\n\n",

    "\nI own many Circulon products, but most of which are under the Circulon 2 line. So when this 2 pack became available, I went ahead and purchased it. I have only used it to cook eggs on and I must say, I was sorely disappointed by the results. Not only did my eggs stick, but I used quite a bit of oil on the 2nd batch to make sure they wouldn\u0027t stick, but they still stuck. My Circulon 2 skillet makes far better eggs than this non-stick version and doesn\u0027t stick! \n\nI\u0027m not sure what I can use these skillets for now since my main intentions were for fish, eggs and items which have a tendency to stick to the pan. It also left a horrible look on the eggs like the kind on eggs cooked with a Teflon pan without oil even though I used quite a bit of oil.\n\nHighly disappointed and will not purchase the Circulon Elite line again\n",
    "\nAfter using my 3 new Circulon pots and lids for only 2 or 3 months, all the Circulon lids have broken plastic handles, including the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan. \nFirst noticed the problem when I got gouged by the broken plastic, I saw that all three Circulon lids showed big chunks of plastic off the underside of the plastic handles.  I am very careful and do not own a dishwasher. \nNext, I saw that two of the faulty handles now had big chuncks off BOTH ends of the plastic handles. All the breakage occured where the plastic \u0027cool\u0027 handle attaches to the metal part of the handle. Just today, when I removed the hot lid from my Toss and Turn pan, the black plastic totally came loose from the metal part of the handle! Only fast dancing saved me from this big hot lid falling on my feet.  But at last I saw the FLAW. Instead of these lids having a complete metal handle that is covered with the plastic for cool handling, the metal part only goes up an inch to meet the plastic. The black plastic only overlaps the metal part for A SCANT HALF INCH OR SO, causing the more sturdy metal part to undermine the plastic, and eventually causing the chipped plastic to separate from the metal with use. The lids are subjected to steam and heat on a daily basis, so no wonder the plastic broke off, the plastic has no backing. It is just carelessly and poorly attached to less than a half inch of the metal that is attached to the lid. This poorly conceived construction is why the handle broke away entirely after the plastic was chipped, A full metal handle covered with plastic would have been nice for the money spent and prevented the accident where the handle completely separated from the chipped plastic. There is no metal supporting that plastic folks. \nMy enthusiasm for the Circulon was originally quite high, but now that I have lidless pots after less than 90 days, I\u0027m pretty unhappy! This chipping happened to 3 out of 3 lids! AND the Toss and Turn lid is almost as expensive as the Toss and Turn pan! Now, after less than 90 days I must send in the Toss and Turn lid and my 2 smaller lids with chipped handles that go with the sauce pans. Because the Toss and Turn handle separated and broke away, this is not merely a cosmetic matter. Even before the lid handle broke entirely, the broken handles were uncomfortable to use with those sharp broken plastic edges digging into my fingers. Sending these lids back will leave me ill equiped in the kitchen after all the money spent to be well equiped. Further, I doubt their replacements will be any better, and they will probably need replacement every 90 days! Much as I love the Circulon pans, these lids make them a bad purchase. I would not buy this product again. Hopefully this review will help you make a good decision about Circulon pans and their bad lids\n",

Too busy, first I bought a Braun toaster (looked great, had major problems actually toasting), then I bought this Krup toaster, and guess what, it looks great but has trouble actually toasting.  Starting with the first piece of toast all is well (hence two stars instead of one).  However, after the toaster is warmed up, the timing/heat regulation becomes totally useless.

    "\nI spent several hours searching \u0026amp; researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice. I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice \u0026quot;measurements\u0026quot; which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the \u0026quot;keep warm\u0026quot; function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet \u0026amp; mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice. Look elsewhere, and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice\n",

Also disappointing is the lack of a retractable electrical cord - winding the electrical cord around a chintzy metal cord holder (unstrategically located at the bottom of the cooker) gets old very quickly.  Lastly, the fancy electronic display is not very informative when cooking rice.  (It may be more helpful when using the appliance as a slow cooker - but we thought we were buying a rice cooker.)\n\nBottom line: it looks like a Krups, does not perform like one, and, with all its good looks, is decidedly un-ergonomic in its design.

We follow directions exactly, but we keep having to stop it, open the lid, check the pods, reclose the lid and try again. This takes all the convenience out of it especially when you have to clean coffe puddles off your counter. This just isn\u0027t acceptable, but it\u0027s mostly plastic so probably to be expected.

    "\nI have been grinding my own coffee beans every morning for many years and have gone through quite a few different grinders.  I have always loved  Cuisinart products and was very excited to purchase this one, what a mistake!  The grinder itself is really noisy and heavy for it\u0027s size. The coffee grinds are never fine enough for my liking and they get stuck up inside the plastic top, making a huge mess and wasting a lot of coffee.  \nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!\n",
    "\nI was excited to upgrade to this coffee grinder after years of using a cheap Krups model, and I have to say that I am very disappointed with the way this machine grinds coffee. It takes way too long to grind, whether pulsing or grinding continuously. And then the grounds are very uneven. Although the manufacturer says it is grinding slowly to keep the flavor in, every coffee expert I\u0027ve consulted with says the longer coffee grinds, the more it heats up and the more flavor is lost. Even after long grinding, there are large pieces of bean still visible. I was also excited about the machine\u0027s detachable bowl, which does make for easy cleaning. But only of the bowl. The rest of the machine is a pain to clean and no matter how carefully you remove the top, your counter is covered in grounds. I bought a second bowl so that I could grind spices in the same machine, and I think the coffee grinder works better on spices and seeds (such as flax) than it does on coffee. But you still have to clean the entire thing before reusing it, or your spices have a strong coffee flavor from the grounds that are stuck to the protective case. (That plastic case does make grinding quieter, however.) All in all I\u0027m quite disappointed with this purchase. I should have gone farther upscale and gotten a more serious burn grinder, or stuck with my cheap Krups with the slanted bowl base which made even grounds quickly.\n",
    "\nCuisinart is one manufacturer that has capitalized on its brand name and produced this inferior product. My criticisms of this machine: \n1.  Its heavy and relatively large. It is awkward to place in and remove from a cabinet, and so it remains on the counter top where it takes up precious real estate with its large footprint. \n2.  It\u0027s slow.  With its weight, you would think the grinder would have a powerful motor that would quickly grind coffee.  It does not.  It takes a very long time to grind the coffee.\n3.  The grind is uneven and actually clumps.  The grind is fine at the bottom and course and clumpy at the top.  The finely ground coffee sticks to the bottom of the bowl below the blade. I must use a finger to remove the ground  coffee or pound the bowel against the palm of my other hand. Pulsing makes no difference.  Grinding a full bowl improves the performance somewhat. Yet, grinding beans for up to minute still does not produce a grind fine enough for even a cone filter.  Espresso is out of the question.  \n4.  I invariably spill ground coffee on the counter top no matter how carefully I remove the lid.  \nAlthough the grinder looks cool with its stainless steel finish and it has a larger bowl than most blade grinders, those two alone do not even come close to overcoming its other deficiencies. Surely there must be better blade coffee grinders on the market\n",

My friend, a fellow cook who got it as a gift, doesn\u0027t like it; I hated it and would never choose to use it. There\u0027s a reason the price is so low\n",

    "\nReceived this toaster as a Christmas present in 2004.  From day one I was not very happy with it.  The knobs and temperature control are difficult to use - sometimes it would bake good, other times it would not.  About 6 months ago I noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial.  About 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time.  Today the timer dial broke off completely.  So I got about a year and a half of poor use out of it.  So, don\u0027t purchase this product, it is not worth it. \n",

I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan\n",

    "\nWhy do manufacturers always have to change a good thing?  \n\nI had a Rival crockpot for over 12 years.  It always worked great.  The idea behind a crockpot is to cood slow and low.  My old Rival cooked at 150 degrees on the \"Low\" setting.  \n\nI use the old Rival all the time, and decided to get a second one so I could use them both simutaneouly and cook two recipes at the same time.  I looked at the reviews for the electronic Rival models.  Everyone said they cooked too hot.  So I finally purchased this 6.5 quart model with the simple knob control.\n\nWell, I filled the crockpot full of 8 lb.s of chicken.  The next morning, I could smell the burning food.  I looked in the pot, and the chicken was boiling on the \"Low\" setting.  \n\nSo, the next night I filled it full of a vegetable soup recipe.  The next morning, the soup was boiling over ... again on the \"Low\" setting.  The veggies were overcooked and mushy.  I measured the temperature and it was 195 degrees.\n\nI won\u0027t buy anymore Rival products.  I only gave this 2 stars because I guess you could conceivably use it to make soup ... If you\u0027re willing to stand over it and turn it off when it starts to overboil\n",

We were very fortunate that our child was kept away from ever using it.\n\nUpon close examination, we found the weak joint to be made of some sort of brittle, composite material, NOT metal.  It\u0027s such a disappointment to see such a terrific design implemented so poorly. \n",

    "\nI honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen\u0027s KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid\u0027s brand and durability behind it.  \n\nI use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn\u0027t be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It\u0027s done.  What an incredible dissappointment.\n\nBut, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool(?).  First, my dishwasher broke (3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer\u0027s seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re-routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues (loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.\n\nI did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don\u0027t make much of anything.  Everything is just a re-branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.\n\nFrom a once KitchenAid loyalist, avoid this product-- yes it\u0027s beautiful but it\u0027s not going to last.  Avoid all KitchenAid products because they really are not what they once were\n",
    "\nWell, I can\u0027t say that I didn\u0027t like this thing at first.  It came with a little scoopy to dig out your coffee beans and grinds.  At first it seems like a nice little unit.  I poured a pot of water into it in order to do away with any oils left over from manufacturing.  I say you should run 3 pots of water through it before use (filterless of course).  After a few uses, I noticed that the carafe does spill out onto the counter if you do not pour slowly.  If you want your coffee now and have no time to pour, don\u0027t get this item.  After having this machine for 3 weeks now, and using it constantly every morning, I have finally decided that it is near total crap.  I just made a pot of coffee this morning when the machine decided it would spurt some hot air \u0026amp; water which caused the grinds blow all over the place.  Spilling out of the top onto the carafe and drooling hot coffee and grinds all over the counter.  How nice.  If you\u0027re going to buy a cheap coffee maker, spend the extra 5 or 6 dollars and get a semi-decent one.  Toastmaster should stick to toasting.  If you do decided to get this, buy some towels and a mop as well\n",
    "\nI should have listened to the other reviews!\n \nPoint 1. This machine is not only just \"noisy\", it CONTINUES to be loud, intermittently! Picture this: You are sipping your hot drink while reading the newspaper, relaxed, the house quiet, when like a knife cutting the silence, a loud grinding sound flies from the kitchen, your dog starts howling \u0026 barking, you jump and relaxation is out the window! It \"recycles\" as long as you leave it on.\n\nPoint 2. It took me TWO cycles (20 minutes) before the stuff was hot enough for me. I like beverages to be as hot as coffee.\n\nPoint 3. Take out your best scrubber \u0026 roll up your sleeves!! For every use, you have to scrub the thick coating off the bottom of the non-immersable pitcher PLUS totally take apart the spout, clean it \u0026 put it back together (it has 5 parts). Hope you have time for this!\n\nPoint 4. Froth? What froth? That\u0027s froth?? Stirring my drink with a spoon makes it look like that.\n\n\nFinal analysis: I can make the same thing in the microwave with less cleanup\n",
    "\nLiked the product when it was working.\n\nI used the machine about 4 times a week for 18 months. It will mix the ingredients but does not heat up the drink any more\n",
    "\nI should have listened when the other reviewers said to stay away from this steamer.  Now I wish I had spent the extra $60 and gotten one from Jiffy.\n\nThe box the unit arrived in was pretty beat up and did not look like it had been professionally taped.  It definitely looked like it had been returned by another customer, and lucky me, I got sloppy seconds.\n\nI read the instructions and assembled it carefully, but the performance is just awful.  Even after letting it heat up for two minutes and then holding the trigger for 30 seconds, as the instructions indicate, it lets out a pathetic gasp of steam.  Additionally, it sprays out great gobs of water all over the clothes, and I don\u0027t mean a few spots of water like you get with any  steamer\n",

    "\nFor fifteen years I\u0027ve talked about getting a good stand mixer and my sweet husband went out and bought me this one. He bought it on sale at Cosco last Spring, then stored it until we moved back to the States from Europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in Nov.  I\u0027ve used it a few times but the paddle and whisk don\u0027t reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will NOT tighten any further.  I can\u0027t get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position... to scape or to add ingredients. I like to make crepes, which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating. It\u0027s impossible with this machine. I get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl, unmixed... and the batter is full of lumps.  If I want to scape the bowl, (which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk doesn\u0027t reach all the way to the sides of the bowl) I have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time, and even then, with the paddle or whisk attached, it\u0027s not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back. You can\u0027t turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely. You have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand. This takes a fair amount of force to maneuver. It\u0027s impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter. The speeds are not variable enough. It seems to be either ploddingly slow or so fast that any liquid or flour flies out. \nIt\u0027s a monumental disappointment and I\u0027m frustrated because it\u0027s been so long since he bought it, I can\u0027t imagine they would allow it to be returned. So, I still mix everything by hand or use my stick mixer and feel crumby about the big white doorstop taking up counter space\n",

This should have been a clue that the thing wasn\u0027t very well designed, and it wasn\u0027t. It ALWAYS needed to be stirred when making any kind of smoothie, several times, which made the process a real pain. Also, the drain spout is a great place for food to hide and get nasty. Except for the jar it\u0027s pretty cheap plastic. But it\u0027s in the trash now because the couleing fried itself after two months. Good riddance\n",

    "\nI had received this set for my Birthday from a friend.  When we unpacked the set we noticed the 8 Quart pot was scratched on the interior.  This made the non-stick aspect of the pot worthless.  I gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to Amazon and had a new set sent out.  When we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot.  I thought I would contact Calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say.  I called the Calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long I gave up.  In retrospect I would spend the extra money and stay away from the non-stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily.  If you get the Calphalon One Infused-Anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service.  Remember the old saying \"you get what you pay for.\"  I don\u0027t think these non-stick pans will look very good after a years worth of use.

Now the way I make my burgers is by adding some chopped onions, garlic, and green chillies to the ground meat. That is where the pan gave problems. The meat cooked ok but the small pieces of chopped onions, garlic, and chillies that fell out of the patties got burnt very fast and stuck to the pan making it difficult to clean. I spent about 20 mins cleaning each time.\n\nFor cooking meat that is seasoned only this pan may be ok. For me it is sitting in the closet after two tries. I did not return it because the shipping costs would have made returning it too expensive in itself.\n\nUpdate (12/18/2004) I bought a Hamilton Beach 31603 Electric grill for around $20 which is tremendous.

I have never baked above 425 degrees, so the claims that it will withstand 550 degrees are outlandish.  Don\u0027t waste your money\n",
    "\ni have a lot of experience with steamers over the years - mine as well as others used in stores. stupid me, then, for not realizing that you get what you pay for. my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years, but it served me well. it is a machine of substance, solid parts, very stable. trust me - you don\u0027t want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh, and i\u0027m returning it immediately. the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep - not deep enough to keep the pole stable. the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended aren\u0027t firm - any heavy jacket will make them slide. the housing itself is amazingly lightweight; i thought that was a good thing, but now i know why the jiffy steamer\u0027s housing seems like it weighs a ton - you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored. handling a steamer is a serious matter. don\u0027t take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive, poorly designed, lightweight steamer like the conair. spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years: jiffy. you won\u0027t regret it. and even though mine died after nine years, i have no regrets, and now i\u0027ll do the right thing and get another\n",
    "\nThe design features for the on/off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things.  Otherwise, the on/off switch is not good at all.  The button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position.  You actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going.  The blade was sharp for the one and only time I used it.  I took it back right after Thanksgiving\n",
    "\nI was given Mr. Bento as a gift last summer. I was so excited! I bring a lunch to work every day, and I thought Mr. Bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well-organized, balanced, and easy-to-carry lunch. You can imagine my dismay when the Mr. Bento containers leaked day after day. Anything remotely soft came out from the containers, which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way. Cute? Yes. Impress your co-workers? Yes. But practical? No.\n",
    "\nI have owned this blender for two years now and will have to replace it due to one of the plastic mixer pieces snapping off, causing it to continually leak. Unfortunately it appears that I have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion.\n\nOverall, there were definitely questions of durability over the years as small pieces broke off one by one, but it did tend to blend things. \n\nAs a blender alone: It was not the most effective blender I have ever seen but neither was it the worst. It was truly mediocre through and through. \n\nAs a smoothie maker: the mechanism used for the pour spout didn\u0027t allow any chunks to pass through, and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks. So as a smoothie maker it was not a good choice.\nOn the good side, the stainless does look nice... although it was a little tall\n",
    "\nThis is the worst blender I\u0027ve ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It\u0027s also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base\u0027s well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing\n",
    "\n     I have brewed coffee with and without the ridiculously expensive filters and cannot tell the difference. If there was, I still wouldn\u0027t pay this much for plastic and charcoal. What were the designers thinking ??? It is just coffee, not fine wine !\n",
    "\nAfter checking every store I could think of and accepting that I\u0027d have to go online, I laughed out-loud when I saw this price! What was Mr. Coffee thinking? I read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that I don\u0027t even need them! Duh, I have filtered water in our house! Thank you Mr. \"Train Man.\" The little carbon filter sounded like a good idea, but my coffee will survive without it. At least it\u0027s not a total loss because I like the coffee maker itself. Happy brewing.\n\n",
    "\nI am usually very pleased with Oxo products, but this one is a BIG disappointment.  I have not found it to be good for or at anything.  Wished I\u0027d saved the five bucks\n",
    "\nI like the solid construction but I also like strong coffee.  This machine does not \"spray the entire filter basket\". Instead, water dribbles out of a 2-inch diameter ring, leaving dry grounds at the end of the brew cycle. I sent the first one back.  The replacement does the same thing.  KitchenAid customer service confirms that, despite the discription on Amazon, the unit does not spray the entire filter basket.  I\u0027m sending the replacement back also. If you love strong coffee, don\u0027t buy this machine\n",
    "\nI chose this set of knives because of the Calphalon name (I love my cookware!), German steel use, and the description, \"Hygienic fiberglass-reinforced poly resin handle will not absorb moisture, crack, split, or chip.\"  I was disappointed to find that one of the sets I ordered was already showing signs of rust -- even though the set was unused and delivered in a \"sealed\" box, all four handles had rust marks\n",
    "\nI bought this set of knives 2 years ago.  I have not experienced the rust or pock marks that other reviewers have, and I have been pleased with the way my knives have stayed sharp even with a LOT of use.  The purpose for my buying this set was because of the locking feature.  I have little children at home and wanted to make the knives inaccessable to them.  Unfortunately the locking mechanism is a little too hard to open for me.  Mine gets stuck on lock and then I can\u0027t get it open without pulling on it with great force.  And when you are pulling on something full of sharp knives, that is a little uncomfortable to say the least.  I have worried more than once that the force I have had to use to open it would cause the knives to all fly out when it came free.  They never have, but it is unnerving.  I tried to contact Cuisinart about it, to no avail.  No complaints on the knives, and I love that there are extra slots in the block for expanding the set, which I have.  But don\u0027t buy the product strictly for the locking feature, it is not worth it\n",
    "\nThis thermometer lasted about a month before going in to permanent \"Hi\" mode. What a ripoff\n",
    "\nBought my first Vornado years ago, and is the best fan I\u0027ve ever seen. Decided to get a second one... purchased this model. First unit had bad vibration, returned it. Second unit less vibration, but very noisy. Also returned. When I compare this unit to my original Vornado, the quality of construction is noticeably much inferior. I don\u0027t know if this applies to the rest of the Vornado lineup or not.\n",
    "\nMore money then its worth.  Makes alot of noise, small, no oscillation\n",
    "\nMine broke on the 3rd use!  No need to say anymore\n",
    "\nWorked great the first couple of times.  I didn\u0027t keep it on the charger for 24 hours (not realizing that this is a problem) and now the battery only works for 10 minutes at a time.  It\u0027s now basically worthless\n"
